Only 61% of the 2018 national cereal needs are met by the harvest. The total production in 2017 has been estimated at 674,000 tonnes, about 7.5 percent below 2016 and 14 percent lower than the last five-year average creating a cereal deficit of 483,000 tonnes. The worsening food insecurity is primarily driven by continued conflict and displacements, which have contributed to the reduced crop production, disruptions to pastoralist livelihoods and persistent macroeconomic deterioration. Livelihoods have been further eroded by climatic shocks, such as prolonged dry spells and flooding, and pest infestations (e.g. fall army worm).\n\nJanuary 2018 IPC results indicated that an estimated 57% of the population are facing Crisis and Emergency (IPC Phases 3 and 4) acute food insecurity, and require assistance. This proportion is projected to increase to 63% during the height of the lean season in May-July.\n\n1FAO/WFP Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission to South Sudan, March 2018. 2South Sudan January IPC Key Messages, February 2018\n\nSituation Update\n\nOverall, there is high market dependence, particularly in Kapoeta South where all households reported depending on markets for their food needs\n\nInformal and unreliable sources constitute the main sources of income for most households, 55% reported decrease in income compared to the same time last year.\n\nSource: mVAM, February to March 2018\n\nAs the lean season progresses, food insecurity deteriorates in Torit and Juba, where access to normal livelihood activities has been disrupted by insecurity, inconsistently low income and continuous currency devaluation resulting in reduced purchasing power and subsequently leading to inadequate food consumption. In Torit, about of 77 percent of respondent households were found to be having poor to borderline food consumption while in Juba, 97 percent reported eating 1 meal per day as they have already depleted the assets that used to be sources of income to earn basic food.\n\nOverall, surveyed households in all counties reported concerns over high market prices for basic food commodities. In Kapoeta South, all respondent households depend on the market as the sole food source due to poor harvest as a result of dry spell. In addition, the population in Kapoeta South are pastorals and heavily rely on the market for cereals purchase using the income obtained from the sale of livestock.\n\nHigh market prices across all surveyed locations is limiting food access for households. 59 percent of respondent households reported lack of food of any kind during at least one day of the week prior to the survey. 61 percent of respondent households had gone to sleep hungry and 42 percent had spent at least the whole day and night without food during the same period. Given the diminishing purchasing power resulting from low income, constantly increasing market prices and inadequate supply, access to food from markets will remain severely limited. Consequently, households will be compelled to use irreversible copying mechanisms that will likely undermine their future resilience.\n\nThe South Sudanese Pound continues to depreciate against the hard currency which is having a direct impact on the salary of many civil servants given the inconsistent payments. The majority (55 percent) of the surveyed households reported that their purchasing power has decreased as compared to the same time last year due to the continuing local currency devaluation. The main source of income was derived from the \"others\" category which mainly consists of informal and unreliable sources, such as brewing of alcohol, sale of firewood and petty trade. Thus, 55 percent of households reported decrease in income compared to the same time last year, while 26 percent reported no change and only 19% indicated an increase in income.\n\nThe sixth round of mVAM food security monitoring surveys were conducted through live call interviews from WFP's in-house call centre during February - March 2018. A random sample of 206 households were reached in seven counties (Tambura, Nzara, Yambio, Torit, Magwi, Kapoeta South and JubaMunuki), mostly representing urban areas in the Greater Equatoria region, with around 30 completed surveys per county. Calls covered all mobile phone operators. The surveys were conducted in English, Arabic and other vernacular languages. Participants were selected from a database of household phone numbers collected by WFP. Given network constraints, a snowball sampling approach was used to reach a larger sample size, with households recruiting other households to participate.\n\nRespondents were asked questions on food consumption, negative coping behaviours, hunger scale and demographic information as well as an open-ended question about food security in their community. Responses are likely to be biased toward better-offhouseholds living in urban areas where there is adequate mobile phone coverage and better access to electricity and phone-charging services. Conflict and insecurity have made some areas inaccessible by telephone. This introduces an element of bias in the survey that we account for when interpreting the data. This bulletin reports indicative patterns and trends rather than precise estimates.\n\nFig 2: Household income compared to one year ago\n\nMethodology\n\nSource: mVAM, February 2018\n\nMap 1: Surveyed counties, February to March 2018\n\nKrishna Pahari Krishna.pahari@wfp.org Fig. 3: Word Cloud\n\nAt the end of the survey, households were asked to report on the main food security problems in their community. Respondents reported concerns over high market prices and disruption of livelihoods due to restriction in accessing farm lands mong others.\n\n\"People are suffering\". Market prices are too high for people to afford and it's increasing by the day\" - Female respondent from Juba County.\n\n\"Starvation is high \"because maize and other food items being transported from Uganda are very expensive in the market which is not affordable to everyone\".-Male respondent from Kapoeta South.\n\n\"The fire has destroyed many houses and food storage areas. Now there's no shelter, food or even seeds for the next season. People are really suffering especially those who lost everything\". - Male respondent from Nzara County.\n\n\"Fire and flood affected the crops, little harvest is finished since, people are relying on market and wild food\" - Female respondent from Torit County.\n\n\"Food situation is good currently because we had little agriculture produces that will take us up to April and start depleting from April\". - Male respondent from Magwi County.\n\n\"Food situation is bad because crops were destroyed by fall army worm last year and no money to buy food\" - Male respondent from Tambura County.\n\n\"People are suffering, there's wide spread of hunger. Market prices are too high for people to afford plus the insecurity of last year made it very hard to many people to cultivate in the last season\". - Male respondent from Yambio County. mVAM
