Since November, rainfall has been belowaverage in South Africa. The early season abnormal dryness has expanded into several parts of southern and western Mozambique, Zimbabwe, eastern Botswana, and southern Zambia, where rainfall is forecast to be low during the middle of January.\n\n2. Although rainfall has increased in some areas of Madagascar since mid-November, the negative impacts of the delayed onset of the rainfall season is still present. Rainfall is below average in several western provinces of the island.\n\n3. Below-average rain during the past month has resulted in large moisture deficits and below-average vegetation conditions in northwestern Angola.\n\n4. Unusually high temperatures and dryness have been recorded in southeastern Africa and are expected to continue through January.\n\n5. Heavy rainfall over northern Mozambique and southern Tanzania since early January has increased risk of flooding. Aboveaverage rainfall is forecast in the region during late January.\n\n1 2\n\nWeather Hazards Summary\n\nAfrica Overview\n\nVery dry conditions continue in southern Africa\n\nSimilar to the previous week, heavy rainfall activity continued across many northern Zambia, northern Malawi, northern Mozambique, northern Madagascar, and southern Tanzania, with totals exceeding 100mm for many areas. Towards the south, however, rainfall was extremely limited (0-10mm) across Botswana, Zimbabwe, neighboring portions of Mozambique, southern Madagascar, and northern South Africa. A slight increase in rainfall was received over southern South Africa, southern Angola, and northern Namibia (Figure 1).\n\nLimited rainfall in southern Africa has increased concerns for drought, water availability and impacts on cropping activities. Since the beginning of the monsoon, many areas have experienced a delayed onset or poorly distributed rainfall. Although some of early seasonal dryness was offset by rainfall during November and December, seasonal rainfall has been below-average across much of the southern continent since late December. Deteriorating crop conditions have been observed in some parts of South Africa.\n\nMany regions in Zambia, Mozambique, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and South Africa recorded less than half of their normal rainfall accumulation over the last 30 days (Figure 2). In parts of South Africa and southern Mozambique, several areas have received less than a quarter of their normal rainfall. This dryness has been associated an anomalous monsoon circulation, where the bulk of heavy seasonal rainfall has occurred and continues over Tanzania, northern Malawi, northern Mozambique and northern Madagascar. Combined with unusually high temperatures in January, drought conditions have been reported. Although there remains time for moisture recovery due to the length of the monsoon, fully recovery is unlikely. This comes at a time where seasonal rainfall normally reaches its peak.\n\nNext week, little relief to the anomalous dryness is expected. Above average rainfall is forecast well north of the Zambezi River. Portions of South Africa are more likely to see increased rainfall amounts in late January.\n\nFigure 1: RFE2 Satellite-Estimated Rainfall (mm) Valid: January 17 - 23, 2018\n\nFigure 2: ARC 30-Day Percent of Normal (%) Valid: December 25, 2017 - January 23, 2018\n\nSource: NOAA/CPC\n\nNote: The hazards outlook map on page 1 is based on current weather/climate information and short and medium range weather forecasts (up to 1 week).

Towards the south, however, seasonal rainfall amounts were extremely li ited (0- 10mm) across Botswana, Zimbabwe, neighboring portions of Mozambique, southern Madagascar, and northern South Africa. A slight increase in rainfall was received over southern South Africa with widespread light to moderate rainfall accumulations, and increased weekly amounts were also registered across southern Angola and northern Namibia according to satellite rainfall estimates (Figure 1).\n\nThe dearth of seasonal rainfall through ut many regions in southern Africa has le to increa d concerns for dro ght, water availabili y and i pacts on cropping activitie . Since the beginning of the monsoon, many regions had experienced either a delayed onset, or poorly distributed and erratic periods of rainfall. Although some of early seasonal dryness was offset by short periods enhanced precipitation during November and December, resulting in some moisture recovery, seasonal rainfall has been markedly poor across a broad swath of the southern continent since late December. Deteriorating crop conditions have been observed in some parts of South Africa, with wilting taken place in Zimbabwe.\n\nThis suppressed ainfall pattern has been widespread, persistent and ill-timed, a many regions in Z mbia, M zambique, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa are experiencing less than half of their normal rainfall accumulation over the last 30 days (Figure 2). In parts of South Africa and southern Mozambique, several local areas have received less than a quarter of their normal rainfall. This dryness has been associated an anomalous monsoon circulation, where the bulk of heavy seasonal rainfall has occurred and continues over Tanzania, northern Malawi, northern Mozambique and northern Madagascar. This has acted to depriving many areas towards the south of seasonal moisture. Combined with anomalously high observ d ground temperatures in January, drought conditions are likely to emerge. Although there remains time for moisture recovery due to the length of the monsoon, the absence and infrequency of seasonal rainfall in January is still likely to deplete water availability and result in decreased crop productions for many southern Africa regions. This comes at a time where seasonal rainfall normally reaches its peak in coverage and intensity.\n\nDuring the outlook period, models again suggest little relief to the anomalous dryness with a poor rainfall distribution and anomalously high daytime maximum temperatures forecast over southeastern Africa, as the higher rainfall amounts are expected to continue well north of the Zambezi River. Portions of South Africa are more likely to see increased rainfall amounts in late January. No tropical activity is expected during the next seven days.\n\n7-Day Satellite Estimated Rainfall (mm) Valid: January 17 - January 23, 2018\n\nFigure 1: NOAA/CPC\n\nSatellite Estimated Percent of Normal Rainfall (%) Valid: December 25, 2017 - January 23, 2018\n\nFigure 2: NOAA/CPC Little to no rainfall received across many dry regions in southern Af ica.\n\nSimilar to the pr vious week, heavy rainfall activity continued across many anomalously wet regions of northern Zambia, northern Malawi, northern Mozambique, northern Madagascar, nd southern Tanzania, with satellite e timated accumulations exce ding 100mm for many local reas. Towards the south, however, seasonal rainfall amounts w re extremely li ited (0- 10mm) across Botswana, Zimb bwe, neighboring portions of Mozambique, southern Madagascar, and north rn South Africa. A slight increase in r i fall was rec ived over southern South Afric with widespread light to moder te rainfall accumulations, and increas d weekly amounts were also register d across southern Angola and northern Namibia ccording to s tellite rainfall estimates (Figure 1).\n\nThe dearth of seasonal rainfall throughout many regions in southern Africa h s led to increase concerns for drought, water availability and impacts on cropping activities. Since t e beginni g of the monsoon, many regi ns had experienc eith r delayed o set, or poorly distributed nd erratic periods of rainfall. Although some of early s as al dryness was offset by short p riods enhanced precipitation during November and December, resulting in some moisture recovery, seasonal rainfall has been markedly poor cross a broad swath of the southern continent since late December. Deteriorating crop co ditions hav been observed in s me parts of Sout Africa, with wilting taken place in Zimbabwe.\n\nThis suppress d rainf ll pattern has b en widespread, persist nt and ill-timed, as many regions in Zambia, Mozambiqu, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Bot wa a and South Africa are experiencing less than half of their normal rainfall accu ulation over the last 30 days (Figure 2). In parts of South Africa and souther Mozambique, several local areas have received less than a qu rter of their normal rainfall. This dryness has been associated an anomalou monso n circul tion, where the bulk of heavy se sonal rainfall has occurred an continue over Tanzania, northern Malawi, northern Mozambique and northern Madaga c r. This has acted to depriving many areas towards the so th of sea onal moisture. Combin d with a omal usly high observed ground t mperatures in January, drought conditions are likely to e erge. Alth ugh there rem ins time for moisture recovery due to the length of the monsoon, th absence and infr quency of seasonal rainfall in January is still likely to deplete water availability and result in decreased crop produ tions for many southern Africa regions. This come at a time where s asonal rainfall normally reaches its peak in coverage and intensity.\n\nDuring the outlook period, models again suggest little relief to the anomalous dryness with a poor rainfall distribution and anomalously high daytime maximum temperatures for cast over southeastern Africa, as the higher rainfall amounts are expecte to contin e well north of the Za bezi River. Portions of S uth Africa re more likely to see incre sed r infall amounts in late January. No tropical activity is expected during the next seven days.\n\nCentral Asia Weather Hazards\n\nCentral America and the Caribbean Weather Hazards\n\nFlooding Abnormal Dryness Drought Severe Drought Tropical Cyclone Potential Locust Outbreak Heavy Snow Abnormal Cold Abnormal Heat\n\nTemperatures\n\nBelow-normal temperatures prevailed across Kazakhstan from January 14 to 20 with the larges negative anomalies of -8 to -10°C observed in western and central Kazakhstan. Minimum temperatures fell below -30°C across central and northeast Kazakhstan during the past week. Abovenormal temperatures were observed across Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and southern parts of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.\n\nEarly next week, minimum temperatures may average more than 15°C below normal northeast Kazakhstan. Minimum temperatures are expected to fall below -35°C in northeast Kazakhstan, where an abnormal cold hazard is posted.\n\nPrecipitation Widespread precipitation (2-32mm, liquid equivalent) was limited to southeast Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan from January 14 to 20, with only light precipitation (8mm or less) observed across western Tajikistan. Based on below-average snow water equivalent values, an abnormal dryness hazard is posted for much Afghanistan and Tajikistan.\n\nWidespread snowfall (locally more than 25mm, liquid equivalent) is expected across Tajikistan along with northern and central parts of northern and central Afghanistan during the final week of January. A heavy snow hazard is posted for these areas.\n\nNo Hazards Posted for\n\nCentral America\n\nNo Hazards Posted\n\nWeather Hazards Summary Central America and the Caribbean Overview\n\nNormal temperatures and rain for next week Rainy conditions were observed throughout regions along the Caribbean coastline last week (10-50mm), with the largest amounts recorded in northern Honduras. Heavy rain also fell in eastern Costa Rica and southern Nicaragua (>200mm). Elsewhere, much of Guatemala, El Salvador, Southern Honduras and western Nicaragua remained dry. Thus far, performance during the Apante season has been near normal across much of Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize, and western Honduras. Contrastingly, eastern Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama, has been wetter than average with positive rainfall anomalies exceeding 200mm, in some cases. Vegetation is mostly healthy. Cooler than normal temperatures and near freezing lows continued into last week.\n\nOver the next week, rain is expected to continue over the Caribbean Sea adjacent areas of Central America and possibly central portions of Guatemala. Temperatures should return to normal.\n\nScattered light rains affected parts of the island during the past week Less than 25mm of rainfall were observed in parts of central Haiti and Dominican Republic last week. Many other parts of the island did not receive any rainfall. Relatively dry conditions are normal for the time of year, so the past week's rain did not result in 7-day rainfall anomalies. Over the last 30 days, rainfall performance has been near to or wetter than average. The wetter conditions have generally been found across southern and western portions of Hispaniola. Vegetation health indices depict favorable conditions across most of the island. Weather models forecast scattered light rain showers next week, typical for mid-January. The greatest chances for up to 25mm of rain are along the northeastern coast of the Dominican Republic.\n\nABOUT WEATHER HAZARDS Hazard maps are based on current weather/climate information, short and medium range weather forecasts (up to 1 week) and their potential impact on crop and pasture conditions. Shaded polygons are added in areas where anomalous conditions have been observed. The boundaries of these polygons are only approximate at this continental scale. This product does not reflect long range seasonal climate forecasts or indicate current or projected food security conditions.\n\nSource: NOAA/CPCSource: NOAA/CPC\n\nFigure 4: GEFS mean total rainfall forecast (mm) Valid: January 24 - 31, 2018\n\nFigure 5: CMORPH rainfall climatology (mm) Valid: January 17 - 31, 2018\n\nQuestions or comments about this product may be directed to Wassila.Thiaw@noaa.gov or 1-301-683-3424.\n\nNear-normal temperatures and increased rain chances are in the forecast. Rainy conditions were observed throughout regions along the Caribbean coastline during the last 7 days. 10mm to as many as 50mm of rain were observed according to satellite rainfall estimates. Gauge reports indicate even higher amounts in northern Honduras. Satellites also indicate heavy rains occurred in eastern Costa Rica and southern Nicaragua, dumping more than 200mm. Elsewhere, much of Guatemala, El Salvador, Southern Honduras and western Nicaragua remained dry. Thus far, performance during the Apante season has been near normal across much of Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize, and western Honduras. Contrastingly, moisture conditions proved wetter than average over areas of eastern Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama, with positive rainfall anomalies exceeding 200mm, in some cases, since December 1. Vegetation indices point towards healthy ground conditions. A few local areas, such as in eastern Nicaragua, show some middle range values. Overall, there has been a positive trend in index values during recent weeks. Cooler than normal temperatures and near freezing lows continued into last week. Over the next 7 days, expect a pattern of wetter than normal conditions similar to last week to continue. Moderate to heavy rain is forecast by weather models over C ribbean S a adjacent area of Central A erica. Additional rains ould expand into ce tr l portions of Guatemala. Some temperature changes re fore ast for the outlook period. Rec nt colder than normal conditions should give way to temper tures very close to Average. This will minimize the risk for high elevation freezes.\n\nWeek 1 Rainfall Total Forecast and CMORPH climatology (mm) January 24 - January 31, 2017\n\nFigure 1: Source NOAA /
