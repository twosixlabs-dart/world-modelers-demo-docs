The feedback and inputs have been tremendously helpful, especially since a broad face-to-face consultation did not take place due to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nFurthermore, IOM Mozambique would like to express its gratitude to IOM colleagues at the Regional Office for Southern Africa in Pretoria, South\n\nAfrica as well as IOM colleagues at Headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland who have shared their insights and provided guidance throughout the development of the IOM Country Strategy for Mozambique 2021-2023.\n\nFOREWORD Mozambique has been historically characterized by dynamic human mobility patterns that contribute to development, the economy and livelihoods of communities. However, the benefits of well-managed migration for development are yet to be maximized to their full potential through whole-of-government migration management approaches that promote safe, orderly and regular migration in Mozambique. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has been operational in Mozambique since 1994. IOM has a solid footprint in the country, with a permanent presence in four provinces and programming in all ten provinces. IOM continues to work closely with the Government of Mozambique and various stakeholders on the multifaceted migration issues affecting the country.\n\nMigration and human mobility have become one of the major trends of the twenty-first century and one of the most topical and controversial issues of our time. With almost 250 million international migrants around the world, migrants constitute some 3 per cent of the world's population, and all indications show that the phenomenon is most likely to be on the rise for decades to come.\n\nMozambique is not the exception to this trend. The country is large and has more than 53 border crossing points and bordering landlocked countries (Eswatini, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe) and therefore is one of the key linkages to major seaports and to the regional hub of southern Africa. These transport corridors (Maputo, Beira and Nacala corridors) are home to mobile and migrant populations, including cross border traders and long-distance transporters. In addition, Mozambicans from the southern provinces of Maputo, Gaza, Inhambane and to a lesser extent Manica, have historically migrated for work, mainly to South Africa, but also to other countries. On top of that, more than 700,000 persons have been internally displaced due to natural disasters and insecurity since 2017. Furthermore, Mozambique is located along a migration corridor, the so-called Southern Route, frequently used by migrants from East and the Horn of Africa to travel to South Africa in search of protection and economic and education opportunities.\n\nIn this context, Mozambique is presented with an opportunity to hinge on the positive outcomes of well-managed migration by leveraging the complex bidirectional relationship between migration and development. Such leveraging will only be possible through the understanding that migration is a multisectoral and non-linear phenomenon that requires an integrated and holistic approach at all levels of governance. By becoming part of the Global Compact for Migration, the Government of Mozambique has made a bold declaration, as its participation will bring migration at the heart of development and multilateralism in the country and region. With the inclusion of migration as a cross-cutting theme in the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development, all these international instruments will serve Mozambique in its endeavour to bear the positive benefits of well-managed migration.\n\nIOM Mozambique developed this Country Strategy against this backdrop; the strategy will serve as a blueprint for IOM's programming in the country until 2023. The strategy is based on IOM's stance that migration is not a problem to be solved but a human reality to be managed, and if well managed, will be beneficial to countries of origin, transit, and destination, as well as the migrants and society as a whole. The intended results captured in this strategy can only be reached through the collective efforts of all concerned stakeholders. IOM stands ready to contribute to the government's efforts and work with all stakeholders towards strengthened migration management.\n\nLaura Tomm-Bonde IOM Mozambique, Chief of Mission Mozambique has been a Member State of IOM since 2011. IOM Mozambique operates from the head office in Maputo as well as sub-offices in Beira and Pemba and field offices in Nampula City (Nampula Province), Memba (Nampula Province) and Ibo (Cabo Delgado Province). As of December 2020, active IOM programming includes Migration Health, Migrant Protection and Assistance, Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration, Peacebuilding and Community Resilience, Immigration and Border Management, Migration Research and multi-sectoral emergency and recovery programming related to cyclones Idai and Kenneth, as well as the displacement in northern Mozambique due to the situation of insecurity in Cabo Delgado province. IOM is closely working with the Government of Mozambique and has been providing technical support and assistance to the Government since 1994.\n\nSource: Humanitarian Data Exchange - data.humdata.org.

IOM is committed to the principle that humane and orderly migration benefits migrants and society. With 173 member states, (a further 9 states holding observer status) and offices in over 100 countries IOM officially joined the United Nations family as a related organization in September 2016, further underscoring the role that IOM plays in the field of human mobility.\n\nOFFICES 16\n\nSTAFF 416 eld o ces sub o ces national o ce 2 3 national sta 90%\n\nIOM IN MOZAMBIQUE\n\nNational Office\n\nSub Offices\n\nField Offices\n\nMigration and Health\n\nImmigration and Border Management\n\nLabour Migration and Human Development\n\nMigration Data, Research and Policy\n\nMigrant Protection and Assistance\n\nMigration, Environment and Climate Change\n\nDurable Solutions for Recovering Communities\n\nPeacebuilding and Community Stabilization\n\nCommunity Engagement and Policing\n\nDisaster Risk Reduction\n\nCamp Coordination Camp Management\n\nShelter and Non-Food Items\n\nProtection and MHPSS in Emergencies\n\nHealth in Emergencies\n\nDisplacement Tracking Matrix (DTM)\n\nPeacebuilding, Community Stabilization and Disarmament, Demobilization and\n\nReintegration\n\nVISION\n\nIOM is the Government of Mozambique's key partner in continuously improving migration management and governance and safeguarding the dignity and protection of migrants and migration-affected communities.\n\nMISSION Well-managed migration is a catalyst for Mozambique's sustainable development that benefits migrants, communities and society alike.\n\nCONTEXT ANALYSIS http://www.ine.gov.mz/noticias/populacao-mocambicana-para-2021. 1 https://data.unicef.org/country/moz/. 2 www.worldbank.org/en/country/mozambique/publication/mozambique-economic-update-less-poverty-but-more-inequality. 3\n\nThe Republic of Mozambique is a multi-ethnic, multicultural and multi-religious country with a population just over 30 million (Instituto Nacional de Estatística, 2021).1 Mozambique is a low-income country and shares land borders with six countries, namely Eswatini, Malawi, South Africa, the United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. To the east, Mozambique has a sea coast on the Indian Ocean. Mozambique has arable land, water, energy, and mineral resources, as well as offshore natural gas.\n\nMozambique has historically been part of global and regional migration and trade networks and continues to play an important role due to its strategic location; four of the six countries bordering Mozambique are landlocked, and hence dependent on Mozambique's deep seaports to access global markets. Mozambique is a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). Mozambique's strong ties to the region's economic engine, South Africa, underscore the importance of its economic, political and social development to the stability and growth of Southern Africa as a whole.\n\nMozambique has experienced unprecedented population growth in recent years and has grown rapidly from 16 million in 1997 to approximately 30.3 million in 2019. Adolescents are the fastest growing population group in Mozambique; an estimated 45 per cent of the population is younger than 15 years and 52 per cent younger than 18 years (UNICEF).2 The country is ranked as 'low' on the human development index3 and almost half of the population lives in poverty (48% in 2018).4 Since the end of the civil war (1976-1992), internal migration and urbanization have increased in the country, but two thirds of its population live in rural areas and the majority is largely involved in subsistence agriculture.5 Even though Mozambique has seen economic growth over the past years, inequality has not reduced. Persistent inequalities remain, based on various factors, including location (rural/urban), province and gender.\n\nMozambique is a source, transit, and destination country for migration (regular, irregular and forced). Other types of migration can be linked to traditional and localized cross-border migration linked to nomadism and crossborder movement with neighbouring countries. For the entry and exit of citizens, the Republic of Mozambique has 56 officially established Border Control Posts including airports, land border crossings and blue border points.\n\nFollowing Cyclone Kenneth, IOM distributed tarpaulins and toolkits with building supplies to provide shelter support to affected families in Cabo Delgado. © IOM 2020\n\nIOM MOZAMBIQUE10\n\nEMIGRATION AND DIASPORA People emigrate from Mozambique for various push and pull factors. Historically, push factors have included the liberation war, natural disasters, instability, as well as a lack of economic opportunities. The main pull factor has been economic opportunities. Estimates vary, but according to 2010 World Bank estimates, approximately 11.7 million Mozambicans had migrated temporarily and permanently.6\n\nMigration is an important enabler of sustainable development and therefore has significant potential for contributing to both the well-being (social, economic and physical) of individual migrants and of their communities of origin and destination.7 According to World Bank data, in 2019, personal remittances accounted for 2 per cent of Mozambique's gross domestic product (GDP). Beyond their well-known role as senders of remittances, migrants can also promote trade and foreign direct investment, create businesses, spur entrepreneurship and transfer new knowledge and skills.\n\nMany Mozambican migrants travel to countries neighbouring Mozambique such as Eswatini, Malawi, South Africa, or the United Republic of Tanzania. Those who leave the continent mainly go to Germany, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.8\n\nIOM, Mozambique Explores Engagement with Diaspora | International Organization for Migration (iom.int).

These movements are characterized as circular migration movements.\n\nMigration within Southern Africa comes with particular additional risks to migrants' well-being, as many work in the informal economy and therefore have limited access to services and assistance. Some Mozambican migrants abroad face hardships such as bad working and living conditions, limited access to health services and being unable to meet their sexual and reproductive health rights, amongst others. Some migrants travel irregularly or overstay. Migrants in irregular situations are exposed to significant risks in terms of violence, abuse and exploitation, including trafficking in persons.\n\nIOM staff and volunteers set up tents at Samora Machel Accommodation Centre in Beira after Cyclone Idai in cooperation with government authorities to support displaced families. © IOM April 2019/Sandra BLACK\n\nIOM MOZAMBIQUE11\n\nSOUTHERN MIGRATION ROUTE\n\nAND IRREGULAR MIGRATION\n\nMozambique is a key transit corridor for migrants from diverse backgrounds and multiple regions, such as from the mainland and other regions such as East and the Horn of Africa, and East Asia. These are mixed migration flows that include regular and irregular migrants, victims of trafficking and other groups. Mixed migration flows are characterized and under-pinned by multiple drivers, including socioeconomic factors, conflict and political instability. One of the main migration corridors is the so called 'Southern Route,'9 used mostly by migrants from the East and Horn of Africa, and which goes through Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique to the regional centre of South Africa. Most migrants who use this route are in search of economic and educational opportunities as well as protection. Another key flow is through the coastal zone of the Province of Cabo Delgado towards the south of the country and into South Africa.\n\nOn average, around 300 migrants are deported annually from Mozambique, with a considerable number using Mozambique as a transit country. Prior to their arrest due to irregular status, most of the returned migrants were stranded in transit to South Africa or had worked, at times irregularly, in Mozambique to earn funds to continue their journey to South Africa. Others were unsuccessful asylum seekers.\n\nIn Pursuit of the Southern Dream: Victims of Necessity Assessment of the irregular movement of men from East Africa and the Horn to South Africa. 9\n\nIOM, 2009.

Traffickers lure voluntary migrants, especially women and girls from rural areas in neighbouring countries, to cities in Mozambique or South Africa with promises of employment or education. Traffickers also exploit Mozambican girls in bars, roadside clubs, overnight stopping points, and restaurants along the southern transport corridor. Child sex trafficking is of growing concern in the cities of Maputo, Beira, Chimoio, Tete and Nacala, which have highly mobile populations. As workers and economic migrants seek employment in the growing extractive industries in Tete and Cabo Delgado, the demand for sexual services may increase, potentially including child sex trafficking. In addition, increased internal displacement in Mozambique makes persons increasingly vulnerable to trafficking. Mozambican men and boys are also victims of trafficking for forced labour in South African farms and mines. Traffickers also exploit Mozambican adults and girls in forced labour and sex trafficking abroad, including in Angola, Italy and Portugal.11 The Government has a Reference Group on Child Protection and Combating Trafficking in Persons and is setting up a National Referral Mechanism for the identification and assistance to victims of trafficking and irregular migration.\n\nThousands of Mozambican miners received health checks from IOM to facilitate their return to South Africa following border closures due to COVID-19.

Available at: https://data2.unhcr.org/en/country/moz. 12\n\nImmigration has an increasing impact on the socioeconomic development of low-income countries. With relative political stability and socioeconomic development, Mozambique has witnessed an influx of migrants from the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa regions, Malawi, South Africa and Zimbabwe, as well as from European and Asian citizens, particularly Bangladeshi, Chinese, Indian, Pakistani and Portuguese. By mid-2019, the international migrant stock in Mozambique was around 334,700 or 1.1 per cent of the population: approximately 51.7 per cent of this stock were female (UN DESA, 2019).\n\nMigrants are found in all the provinces of Mozambique. The locations of migrant settlements are mostly associated with economic interests. Immigrants tend to settle in the urban areas of Maputo City, Maputo Province and Nampula. The main nationalities are Chinese, Indian and Portuguese.\n\nIncreasingly, as the extractive industries in Mozambique and related sectors expand, people travel to Mozambique to get involved in this sector. Furthermore, migrants work in the mining, fishing, wood exploitation and other sectors, in many cases as part of the informal economy. In 2016, the Mozambican state repatriated over 3,970 foreign nationals with an irregular status, according to the National Migration Service (SENAMI). Of these, most were citizens of Malawi, Nigeria, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zimbabwe who settled in the provinces of Cabo Delgado, Tete, Niassa and Nampula.\n\nREFUGEES AND ASYLUM SEEKERS\n\nAs of August 2020,12 Mozambique had received over 26,257 refugees and asylum seekers, mainly from the Democratic Republic of Congo (37.5%), Burundi (32.8%), Rwanda (14.1%), Somalia (13.2%), Ethiopia and other nationalities (2.4%). Many of these refugees and asylum seekers are residing in the Maratane Refugee Centre in Nampula Province. The remainder live in several urban areas, particularly the cities of Nampula and Maputo.\n\nAnita, displaced by Cyclone Idai, received health and psychosocial support from IOM to recover from tuberculosis; she is able to again care for her children. © IOM 2020/Sandra BLACK\n\nIOM MOZAMBIQUE13\n\nFamilies in resettlement sites received shelter materials from IOM to facilitate recovery following Cyclone Idai. © IOM 2020/Sandra BLACK GFDRR Disaster Risk Profile: Mozambique - www.gfdrr.org/en/publication/disaster-risk-profile-mozambique. 14\n\nRURAL - URBAN MIGRATION\n\nSixty-eight per cent of the population of Mozambique lives in rural areas and the majority of the population is largely involved in subsistence agriculture (World Bank, 2019).13 Over the past decades, internal migration and urbanization have increased. Cities are expanding rapidly, often with limited or no intervention by the Government. This trend of rural-urban migration (urbanization) is expected to keep growing in the future and with limited urban planning, can rapidly worsen living conditions in urban areas, with significant pressure on available resources and services.\n\nINTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (IDPs)\n\nMozambique faces various challenges including insecurity, natural disasters and public health risks such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the last three years, Mozambique has witnessed multiple waves of conflict and natural disasters, which have affected the lives of millions of Mozambicans.\n\nThe country is experiencing ever more weather-related events, including both droughts and heavy rains. The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)14 ranks Mozambique the third most vulnerable in Africa for such\n\nIOM MOZAMBIQUE14 events. These events can be triggers for migration but can also exacerbate the already complex process of settlement and integration. INGD has recorded 67 extreme weather events in the period 1956-2008, including droughts, floods, cyclones, epidemics, windstorms and earthquakes. These events have affected an estimated 28 million persons and killed over 100,000 persons.15\n\nIn 2019, two consecutive category-4 tropical cyclones hit Mozambique within a six-week period in March and April, causing extensive destruction and damage to Sofala, Manica, Tete, Zambezia, Cabo Delgado and Nampula provinces in the central and northern parts of the country. These events affected more than 1.8 million people. Based on an assessment conducted in April 2020, most people in resettlement sites (89%) still live in emergency and temporary shelters. The remaining 11 per cent have upgraded to transitional shelters (9%) and permanent houses (2%).16 Many resettlement sites still struggle to access basic goods and services. In addition, floods and drought in Mozambique have affected the ability of settled IDP families to cultivate subsistence crops, placing them at risk of food insecurity.\n\nSimilarly, in the northern region of Mozambique, past grievances and current violence have led to high levels of stress, tension and strained social coping mechanisms. The security environment in Cabo Delgado started to worsen in 2017 but escalated in 2019 and further deteriorated in 2020, when attacks and violence against civilians increased.\n\nAs a result of insecurity in Cabo Delgado, the humanitarian situation is deteriorating in both the host and displaced communities, as well as for persons left behind in communities of origin. In 2020, there has been a steady and significant increase of IDPs. In late 2020, IOM Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) Baseline Assessment Round 7 collected information on a total of 527,975 IDPs who were displaced due to insecurity in the northern region. Nampula, Niassa, Sofala and Zambezia provinces have also been receiving thousands of IDPs. It can be expected that there will be an increase in IDPs as the security situation in Cabo Delgado deteriorates, leaving both IDPs and host communities in need of support as local resources become overstretched. www.mz.undp.org/content/mozambique/en/home/library/environment_energy/study_on_the_impact_of_climate_change_on_disaster_risk_management.html. 15\n\nShelter Recovery Assessment in the Central Region of Mozambique (Manica, Sofala, Tete and Zambezia) April 2020 - https://displacement.iom. int/system/tdf/reports/Shelter%20Recovery%20Assessment%20in%20the%20Central%20Region%20of%20Mozambique%20April%202020_0. pdf?file=1&type=node&id=8437. 16\n\nIn the central region, communities still struggling to recover from decades of violence during the Mozambican Civil War (1976-1992) were hit with a wave of conflict in 2013-2017, displacing over 23,000 people. While still attempting to rebuild community cohesion, communities were devastated by Cyclone Idai, which caused mass destruction and displacement in March 2019. On 6 August 2019, the Government of Mozambique and the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO), under the leadership of the President of the Republic of Mozambique and the President of RENAMO, signed the National Accord for Peace and Reconciliation. The months following the accord have seen sporadic outbreaks of violence, particularly in the districts most affected by the conflict between 2013 and 2017, as a splinter group of RENAMO, a Military Junta, disputes the party's leadership of the current President of RENAMO, Ossufo Momade, and demands to be recognized as stakeholder in the Peace Agreement.\n\nREINTEGRATION OF FORMER COMBATANTS\n\nDespite the intermittent violence, the Demobilization, Disarmament, and Reintegration (DDR) exercise as stipulated by the August 2019 Peace Accord has proceeded, targeting over 5,000 combatants. The Peace Support Secretariat which is coordinating and facilitating the DDR process, has made clear the need for a robust and effective reintegration process. Reintegration, however, has not yet been fully planned nor implemented, and to date DDR efforts have centered largely on support to individual combatants, and demobilized combatants are likely to attempt to reintegrate into communities that have been disrupted by violence and, in some cases natural catastrophes. Communities also suffer from perceptions of economic exclusion due to partisan affiliation, which has fuelled community tension. Literature also suggests that RENAMO combatants demobilized in 1992 still struggle with their reintegration. These former combatants have instead created (or maintained) their own networks of support, thus furthering their sense of social exclusion.\n\nIOM MOZAMBIQUE15\n\nCROSS-CUTTING THEMES\n\nIOM Mozambique integrates the following cross-cutting themes into its projects and programmes. Each cross-cutting theme will be addressed according to the nature of the project and programme and integrated in each phase of the project implementation cycle.\n\nRights-based Programming\n\nAs an intergovernmental organization and the leading global agency in the field of migration, IOM is mandated by its constitution and policy documents, adopted by all its Member States, to contribute to the protection of migrants. IOM does this by actively promoting the dignity of migrants, their well-being and respect for their rights, and by adopting a rights-based approach in all its policies, strategies, projects, and activities. To achieve these goals, IOM will respect, protect and fulfil the rights of individuals regardless of nationality or migration status and without discrimination, in order to preserve their safety, physical integrity and dignity.\n\nGender Mainstreaming\n\nGender mainstreaming is the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas and at all levels. IOM will ensure that women's and men's concerns and experiences are an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and societal spheres so that all genders benefit equally.\n\nRosa, who lost her home and previous vegetable stand in Cyclone Idai, set up a new stand in Mandruzi Resettlement Site, using tarps that she received, in order to earn a livelihood to support her children.

IOM will limit and mitigate potentially damaging factors, so its programmatic interventions do not contribute to environmental degradation or damage. Hence, IOM will take all possible measures to prevent harming biodiversity and ecosystems. By promoting sustainable development, IOM is committed to ensuring that meeting the needs of people today does not degrade the available resources to meet the needs of the next generation.\n\nDo No Harm\n\nIOM is committed to ensuring that all its responses are designed in a way that avoids any unintended negative effects. IOM aims to ensure that its interventions are delivered according to needs of beneficiaries, prioritize safety and dignity, are grounded on participation and empowerment of local capacities, and are accountable to affected individuals and communities.\n\nMainstreaming Protection into Crises Responses\n\nThe mobility dimensions of humanitarian crises often include complex and large-scale migration flows and mobility patterns that typically involve significant and diverse vulnerabilities for affected individuals and communities. IOM will ensure the appropriate protection of affected persons, including migrants (displaced persons, refugees, asylum seekers, stateless persons, etc.) and crisis-affected communities of origin and destination of migrants.\n\nInnovative Programming\n\nIOM Mozambique aims to implement innovative practices and processes for effective programme operations. The focus will lie on developing innovative solutions to address the needs of beneficiaries through participatory methods, and on process innovation to improve programme implementation.\n\nIOM MOZAMBIQUE17\n\nIMPLEMENTATION APPROACHES\n\nIOM Mozambique will promote the following implementation approaches throughout its projects and programmes:\n\nIntegrated Multisectoral Programming\n\nMost provinces in Mozambique face multiple challenges and issues that can only be addressed through comprehensive responses. IOM will adopt an integrated multisectoral approach to respond to migration, mobility and displacement-related challenges. IOM already implements an integrated multisectoral approach to its interventions, responding to disaster and insecurity-induced displacements in the central and northern regions. The lessons from this area of operations will be leveraged to expand it across the mission when possible.\n\nHumanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus (HDPN)\n\nIOM recognizes the importance of  simultaneous, rather than sequential engagement  of different stakeholders. This approach allows mainstreaming of this nexus, which strengthens coherence between humanitarian, development and peace actions in crises settings. IOM will seek to capitalize on the comparative advantages of each pillar to reduce overall vulnerability and the number of unmet needs, strengthen risk management capacities, respond to critical needs while increasing resilience, address the root causes of crises, and support long-term solutions. Through the development of collective outcomes that support coherent and complementary coordination, programming and financing across IOM programmes and partners, IOM will mainstream the humanitarian-development-peace nexus across its mission.\n\nEvidence-based Programming\n\nIOM will promote evidence-based programming by increasing the number of research projects, assessment and evaluations on migration management and across IOM programming. These actions will rely on the information products developed using the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) and IOM's in-house expertise in Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability and Learning. IOM Mozambique aims to generate evidence on a wide range of issues that affect migration patterns and migrants' well-being to inform programming and policy formulation internally and with partners.\n\nPromoting a Whole-of-Government Approach\n\nAs outlined in the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, \"migration is a multi-dimensional reality that cannot be addressed by one government policy sector alone.\" IOM therefore applies a whole-of-government and society approach to migration governance, striving to ensure that migration and migrants' needs are considered across all policy areas, laws and regulations.    IOM therefore supports the Government of Mozambique in understanding how multiple governance areas are interrelated and affected by migration and to what extent other sectoral policies facilitate or impede migrants' ability to contribute to society.\n\nShelter reconstruction kits are provided to families whose homes were damaged in Cyclone Idai to facilitate repairs. © IOM 2020\n\nIOM MOZAMBIQUE18\n\nMalawian migrants, stranded in Mozambique following their departure from South Africa, received Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration support from IOM. The return transportation included COVID-19 prevention measures. © IOM October 2020/Sandra BLACK\n\nCommunity-Based Approach\n\nA community-based approach entails considering the needs, desires and skills of individuals and communities during all stages of IOM's programme cycle. Such approach recognizes the resilience, capacities, skills and resources of affected populations, and builds on these to deliver programme interventions. Through this approach, IOM will support the work of communities to prevent and address social problems, instead of relying on external actors to assume these responsibilities. Thanks to its significant footprint and operational capacity on the ground, IOM is well positioned to promote an individual-based approach across its programmes.\n\nConflict Sensitivity\n\nBased on the analysis and local understanding of operational contexts, IOM will seek to avoid fueling existing, or creating new, divisions, tensions and conflicts.\n\nLocalization of Interventions\n\nWhile migrants and displaced persons may travel long distances, migration is fundamentally a local-to-local dynamic that links the places from which migrants come, through which they transit, where they settle and to which they return - and often maintain ties and attachments. These dynamics are mediated by local and regional authorities on the ground who are the 'first responders' to migration. Thus, decentralized levels of governance and other key local actors are uniquely placed to articulate migration realities. This localization, in turn, creates more applicable and responsive national policies that can be more successfully implemented at the local level. Through programming IOM will ensure that local actors and partners are engaged and participate throughout the design, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of projects and programmes.\n\nIOM MOZAMBIQUE19\n\nSTRATEGIC PRIORITIES AND FOCUS AREAS\n\nThis country strategy has three priorities; they all contribute to fulfilling the rights of migrants for the benefit of society. IOM Mozambique is committed to promote migration as a key factor for development by supporting the\n\nGovernment of Mozambique and its partners to implement whole-of-government migration governance approaches that support resilient communities.\n\nS T\n\nR A\n\nT E\n\nG I C\n\nP 1\n\nR I O\n\nR I T Y\n\nM ig ra t i o n\n\nG ov er na nce\n\nS T R AT E G\n\nI C\n\nP R\n\nI O R I T\n\nY\n\nPromoting Resilience and D urable So lutions\n\nT E G I C P R I O\n\nR I T\n\nY H umanitarian Preparedness a nd Re sp on se\n\nMozambique Country Priorities\n\nThe SDGs, MiGOF, and the Global Compact for Migration\n\nMan agem ent 3.

IOM will support the Government of Mozambique to link migration and development policies, mainstream a whole-of-government and whole-of- society approach to manage migration, and forge strong partnerships internally and internationally to capitalize on safe, orderly, humane and regular migration for the benefit of all.\n\nFOCUS AREAS\n\nIOM MOZAMBIQUE22\n\nFOCUS AREA 1: MIGRATION DATA, RESEARCH AND POLICY\n\nCoherent policies that promote a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to migration governance and emphasize the links between migration and development are at the core of well-managed migration. The Government of Mozambique and its partners are at a crucial moment to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as they prepare to develop the Government's migration policy, the Government's new 5-Year Plan for Sustainable Development and the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework. IOM will support the mainstreaming of migration management across policy and legislative instruments through key research relevant to policy development. IOM will also strengthen data gathering, analysis and use that allows evidence-based decision-making on the most pressing migration-related topics.

Build the capacities of the Government of Mozambique and communities to prevent, detect and respond to health threats along the mobility continuum, including but not limited to borders (points of entry).\n\nL. Support cross-border cooperation on migration health-related issues, especially with neighbouring countries.\n\nIOM MOZAMBIQUE24\n\nFOCUS AREA 3: IMMIGRATION AND BORDER MANAGEMENT\n\nImmigration and Border Management requires that all competent authorities work together in an effective and efficient manner to minimize bottle necks and potential delays in cross-border mobility, while ensuring the safety and security of those who move along the migration continuum. In addition, cooperation should be established across borders, with relevant agencies and entities in neighbouring States. With the coming into force of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), synergies between immigration and trade are becoming increasingly relevant, with a need to ensure interoperability of policies, systems and operational responses. An assessment carried out by IOM in 2018 evidenced the need to strengthen the capacities the Government of Mozambique, including border and law enforcement agencies, to improve border management and promote the ratification and eventual implementation of the SADC Protocol on the Facilitated Movement of People and Goods. IOM will support the Government of Mozambique to improve it operational systems, human resources and administrative and technical structures required to respond more effectively to diverse migration and border management challenges, while ensuring the protection of vulnerable migrants and security.\n\nObjective: Support the Government of Mozambique in the implementation of integrated border management and immigration processes.\n\n1. New and upgraded tools and infrastructure are available for institutions involved in border management.\n\n2. Strengthened capacities of officers of institutions involved in border management.\n\n3.

Mozambique is a country of origin and transit for migrant workers, mainly to South Africa. In addition, cross-border migration and migration to Mozambique, as well as of Mozambicans to other countries, presents an opportunity to leverage labour migration as a driver of development. In line with the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and the Members of their Families, to which Mozambique is a signatory, and the SADC Labour Migration Action Plan (2020-2025) adopted at the 2020 SADC Ministerial and Social Partners, Employment and Labour Sector Meeting held in Dar Es Salaam, United Republic of Tanzania IOM will support the Government of Mozambique to implement the priorities in this action plan including data collection, bilateral and multilateral coordination, portability of social benefits, remittances, protection of the rights of migrant workers, ethical recruitment and corporate social responsibility. In addition, as a key stakeholder, IOM will promote cooperation between the Government and societal actors such as the private sector and civil society as well as initiatives that foster diaspora engagement.\n\nObjective: Optimize the benefits of labour migration for both the country of origin and of destination, as well as for the migrants themselves, while ensuring the protection of migrant workers and their families.\n\n1. The Government of Mozambique has the tools and information to develop and operationalize labour migration policy and ensure the social protection of migrants and their families.\n\n2. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation on labour migration with countries of origin of migrants in Mozambique and destination of Mozambicans is increased.\n\n3. The Government of Mozambique has the capacities to engage and empower the Mozambican diaspora.\n\n4. Engagement between the private sector in Mozambique, destination countries and the Government of Mozambique is increased to promote ethical recruitment, the protection migrant workers and corporate responsibility in ending slavery and trafficking in persons.\n\n5. Risk of violence, abuse and exploitation of Mozambican migrant workers is reduced as migrant-sending communities are aware of safe migration practices.\n\nA. Build the capacities of the Government of Mozambique to gather, use and analyse data on labour migration, including through the establishment or strengthening of a Labour Migration Information System.\n\nB. Support the implementation of the International Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers and their Families and other regional and global frameworks for the protection of migrant workers.\n\nC.

Strengthen the capacities of the Government of Mozambique to engage and leverage the capacities of the Mozambican diaspora to promote development.\n\n3 19\n\n6 20\n\n18 22\n\nIOM MOZAMBIQUE26\n\nFOCUS AREA 5: MIGRANT PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE\n\nAs a country of origin, transit and destination, Mozambique experiences continuous regular and irregular migration flows, with persons travelling from, across and to Mozambique for varied reasons such as work, education and family reunification. During transit and at destination, migrants, especially the most vulnerable, may be subject to violence, abuse and exploitation, including trafficking in persons. IOM will support the Government of Mozambique, civil society and other partners to provide protection and assistance to migrants in need, including victims of trafficking, stranded migrants, unaccompanied and separated migrant children, migrants subject to violence, exploitation or abuse and others. In addition, IOM will provide direct assistance, including assisted voluntary return and reintegration to the most vulnerable migrants, bridging the gaps in service provision. As a pre-emptive measure, IOM will support local coordination mechanisms and the central Government to prevent trafficking in persons and raise awareness about the risks of irregular migration. IOM will particularly focus on mitigating the significant protection risks that children on the move, including unaccompanied and separated children, face in Mozambique.\n\nObjective: Contribute to upholding the rights of migrants in accordance with international laws and standards.\n\n1. The capacities of the Government of Mozambique and civil society to prevent and respond to trafficking in persons is increased.\n\n2. The child protection system for unaccompanied and separated migrant children in Mozambique is strengthened.\n\n3. Vulnerable migrants receive voluntary return and reintegration assistance.\n\n4.

In addition, if unmanaged, internal and international migration can have an impact on the environment, for example through deforestation for the use of local resources, or increased pollution. IOM will support the Government of Mozambique to study, develop or adapt legal and policy frameworks, and will launch initiatives that can address migration and its links with the environment and climate change.\n\nObjective: Contribute to long-term development through adaptation to climate change and environmental pressures in order to create conditions for migration to be used as an adaptation strategy and a choice.\n\n1. The capacities of government stakeholders are enhanced to address complex migration, environment and climate change matters.\n\n2. Governments, partners and communities have access to data and information for evidence-based policy and programme development on migration, environment and climate change.\n\n3.

IOM will support communities to become resilient, address the negative drivers of migration such as natural disasters, climate change and insecurity, prevent future losses, and strengthen self-recovery capacities. IOM will ensure participation of the most vulnerable groups within activities and local management structures, especially women, children, persons with disabilities and internally displaced persons.\n\nFOCUS AREASPeacebuilding, Community Stabilization and Disarmament, Demobilization and\n\nReintegration Peacebuilding, Community Stabilization and Disarmament, Demobilization and ReintegrationPeacebuilding, Community Stabilization\n\nIOM MOZAMBIQUE30\n\nFOCUS AREA 7: DURABLE SOLUTIONS FOR RECOVERING COMMUNITIES\n\nFollowing the passage of cyclones Idai and Kenneth in March and April 2019 and the subsequent large humanitarian response, Mozambique has transitioned into the recovery and resilience phase. As such, the key interventions currently aim to support displaced persons and other affected populations in Mozambique to build resilience and progress towards sustainable and durable solutions to displacement. In 2016, IOM adopted an inclusive, resilience-oriented approach to resolving displacement, outlined in the Progressive Resolution of Displacement Situations Framework. Through an incremental approach that is aligned with existing global standards and best practices, IOM seeks to strengthen coping capacities, foster self-reliance and create environments conducive to resolving displacement. Central to IOM's approach is the recognition of the need for systematic efforts grounded in long-term and evidence-based development actions that involve multiple sectors and a wide-range of partnerships across humanitarian, development and peace actors.\n\nObjective: Crisis-affected and vulnerable populations who have achieved a durable solution enjoy, without discrimination, an adequate standard of living.\n\n1. Displaced persons have access to durable housing and livelihood solutions.\n\n2. Crisis-affected and host populations are empowered to build and maintain safe community structures, including resilient housing solutions that withstand future disasters.\n\n3.

These programmatic responses focus on understanding the social, economic, resource or political dynamics that drive insecurity and tension in communities through participatory assessments that can inform community-based solutions. Through local stakeholders, IOM Mozambique targets communities vulnerable to, or affected by violence, with activities that promote reconciliation, social cohesion and youth participation.\n\nObjective: Support collaborative processes and community stabilization initiatives that contribute to safe and secure communities.\n\n1. Communities participate in culturally appropriate activities that promote well-being and reconciliation.\n\n2. Social cohesion messaging campaigns are delivered through culturally relevant mediums.\n\n3. Small-scale infrastructure and income generation projects prioritized by communities incentivize peace and social cohesion in communities.\n\n4. Civil society organizations facilitate dialogue for peace in communities.\n\n5. Research informs a contextual base for the community-based interventions.\n\n6. DDR efforts are supported through community- based reintegration initiatives.\n\n16 1\n\n2 16\n\nA.

Implement community-based activities to promote social cohesion in communities receiving ex-combatants.\n\nIOM MOZAMBIQUE32\n\nFOCUS AREA 9: COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND POLICING\n\nWhile the concept of Community Policing has been implemented by governments to make policing more responsive to communities, including in Mozambique, Community Engagement is a distinct but complementary approach promoting local populations' active contributions to their security, for example by providing information. IOM will promote the transition from an incident-based reaction to crime to a more proactive approach that aims to fulfil, respect and promote human rights. This approach will contribute to ensuring security and justice (which are pivotal to development), reducing forced displacement and addressing irregular migration challenges. In addition, recognizing that policing actions must be tailored to the needs and interest of local communities, community engagement and policing will play a key role in Mozambique to establish the foundations for longer-term recovery, including through livelihood restoration, access to services and peaceful coexistence.\n\nObjective: Cooperation and trust between communities and law enforcement is increased through outreach, enhanced information sharing and joint problem solving.\n\n1. Community safety councils (CSCs) are established and strengthened as a critical link between communities and law enforcement.\n\n2. Communities can identify security-related issues and determine solutions through dialogues facilitated by civil society organizations.\n\n3.

Mozambique is subject to environmental events including floods, droughts, cyclones, coastal erosion, rising water levels and soil salinization, which are becoming stronger and more frequent. This vulnerability affects the lives of millions of smallholder farmers every year, destroying livelihoods and infrastructure. At the same time, it is a driver of forced migration that, if not properly managed, can lead to the overpopulation of some areas and create local conflicts over scarce resources. Mozambique has had a disaster risk management system since 2006 that has led to the implementation of initiatives such as formalized contingency planning at the national and district levels. However, recent events such as cyclones Idai and Kenneth evidenced the need for continued and enhanced investment in DRR. IOM will contribute to the Government's efforts to implement the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 by integrating mobility-based strategies to reduce disaster risk and strengthen resilience, paying particular attention to at-risk communities, migrants, displaced populations and other vulnerable mobile groups. Such focus will contribute to preventing or reducing displacement through prevention and mitigation, risk governance and information strategies, as well as strengthened resilience through Build Back Better measures during recovery and reconstruction.\n\nObjective: Strengthen disaster resilience to prevent future losses and displacement.\n\n1. The Government of Mozambique has a Disaster Displacement Management Strategy and a multi-stakeholder Disaster Displacement Action Plan.\n\n2.

Combined with rising insecurity, humanitarian needs are unpredictable but imminent. IOM will support the Government of\n\nMozambique and other partners to prepare for and swiftly respond to the most immediate humanitarian needs of persons affected by crises, ensuring responses are conducive to early recovery. IOM will ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches and protects the most vulnerable, especially women, children, persons with disabilities and internally displaced persons. The thematic areas under this pillar are a core component of the Migration Crisis Operational Framework (MCOF), which was adopted by IOM Member States in 2012.\n\nCamp Coordination and Camp Management\n\nShelter and NFIs in Emergencies\n\nDisplacement Tracking Matrix\n\nIOM MOZAMBIQUE36\n\nFOCUS AREA 11: CAMP COORDINATION AND CAMP MANAGEMENT\n\nAs natural disasters and insecurity continue to displace people in Mozambique, IOM will continue to support the Government of Mozambique to coordinate displacement response in sites across Sofala, Manica, Cabo Delgado and Nampula, as well as other provinces when needs arise. IOM's unique position as an intergovernmental organization allows it to work at scale in complex natural disasters and conflict contexts. IOM will ensure engagement and coordination with relevant government counterparts, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), displaced and host communities, and relevant partners, as leader of the Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) Cluster in the country.

In Mozambique, IOM will remain ready to provide and coordinate Shelter and NFI support as part of emergency capacity, ensuring the response is informed by local and contextualized needs assessments of the affected populations. This component is strongly linked to the Durable Solutions thematic area, as after the emergency response it is important to ensure people will continue to have sustainable living conditions in the long term. IOM will also continue to lead the Shelter Cluster in Cabo Delgado to ensure coordination between partners, as well as adequate management of the IOM common pipeline.\n\nObjective: The humanitarian situation of vulnerable people affected by crisis is improved by restoring dignity and reducing protection vulnerabilities through the provision of immediate emergency shelter and NFI assistance.\n\n1. The living conditions of people affected by crises are improved through the provision of emergency shelter and NFIs.\n\n2.

Protection mainstreaming is the inclusion of humanitarian protection principles into the crisis response through ensuring that any response is provided in a way that avoids any unintended negative effects (do no harm), is delivered according to needs, prioritizes safety and dignity, is grounded on participation and empowerment of local capacities and ultimately holds humanitarian actors accountable vis-à-vis affected individuals and communities. IOM adheres to and integrates the Global Protection Cluster definition of protection mainstreaming. In this context, IOM will provide protection and assistance to migrants in need, including through the prevention of trafficking in persons, gender-based violence and other forms of violence. IOM will also implement an inclusive and human rights-based approach that guarantees the inclusion of availability and accessibility of psychosocial support and mental health care for internally displaced persons and their host communities.\n\nObjective: Contribute to the well-being of crisis-affected populations in accordance with international law and humanitarian standards.\n\n1. Integrated MHPSS/Protection services are available to crisis-affected populations.\n\n2. The knowledge and capacities of community focal persons and government counterparts on psychological first aid, trafficking in persons and child protection is increased.\n\n3.

Raise awareness of affected communities on gender-based violence, trafficking in persons and violence against children, and how to prevent these forms of violence and access support services.\n\nIOM MOZAMBIQUE39\n\nFOCUS AREA 14: HEALTH IN EMERGENCIES\n\nIOM's health interventions in response to crises aim to reduce mortality, morbidity and the human suffering of crisis-affected individuals, by ensuring access to and availability of life-saving health care, while simultaneously supporting the recovery and rebuilding of resilient health systems. In Mozambique, IOM provides direct outreach and referral services through static and mobile capacity support, working closely with the Ministry of Health and other emergency sectors including the CCCM and Protection Clusters. Joint government and IOM mobile brigades and teams will deliver a variety of services, including the identification of HIV and tuberculosis patients and their referral to treatment.\n\nObjective: Contribute to improving the health of persons living in resettlement sites and communities affected by crises.\n\n1. Life-saving primary health-care services are available for the most vulnerable populations in resettlement sites and host communities.\n\n2. The capacities of the Government of Mozambique to address the mobility dimensions of the health crisis, including due to climate hazards or human-induced crises, are increased.\n\n3. The capacities of the Government and communities to prevent, detect and respond to health threats along the mobility continuum are increased.\n\nA.

Support the Government and communities to prevent, detect and respond to health threats along the mobility continuum.\n\nIOM MOZAMBIQUE40\n\nFOCUS AREA 15: DISPLACEMENT TRACKING MATRIX\n\nThe ability to provide humanitarian assistance is highly dependent on trends and patterns of human mobility. The Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) gathers and analyses data to disseminate critical multilayered information on displaced and mobile populations. DTM tracks mobility and displacement over time, monitoring trends and dynamics in populations, needs and flows. Humanitarian actors and governments require information on the location and composition of the affected population to deliver services and respond to needs in a timely manner. IOM, through DTM, will continue to deliver a variety of tools based on monthly data and regular analyses. The information provided will play an essential role, both in country and at regional and global levels, to enable decision makers and responders to make evidence-based decisions and provide crisis-affected populations with context-specific, therefore better, assistance.\n\nObjective: Promote evidence-based decision-making through timely and accurate information on displacement and the needs of persons affected by crises.\n\n1. Information on displacement trends is available to partners.\n\n2. The capacities of the Government and partners in data collection and information management are enhanced.\n\n3.

Implement registration of IDPs through biometric systems.\n\nI. Strengthen cooperation with local authorities to guarantee accessibility to certain areas for data gathering.\n\nIOM MOZAMBIQUE41\n\nPARTNERSHIPS AND COORDINATION\n\nIOM Mozambique closely collaborates with a wide range of stakeholders in Mozambique including the Government, international non-governmental organizations, other non-governmental organizations, the private sector, academia and other actors at the national, provincial and local level. The Government of\n\nMozambique recognizes IOM as a key partner to strengthen the capacities of relevant stakeholders in managing migration, whilst also responding to natural and human- induced disasters and building the resilience of migrants and their communities.\n\nIOM and the Government of Mozambique\n\nMultisectoral groups for the provision of protection services for victims of trafficking and children victims of violence. 19\n\nIn January 2005, IOM signed an agreement with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (MINEC) to establish IOM offices in Mozambique. Before the establishment of offices, IOM provided technical support and implemented targeted project activities from its Regional Office for Southern Africa in Pretoria, South Africa. IOM regularly reports its activities to MINEC yet promotes a whole-of-government approach to migration management by regularly engaging relevant government stakeholders.\n\nIOM also cooperates with the Ministry of Interior (MINT) and especially the National Migration Services (SENAMI). Fruitful collaborations include joint work on strengthening border management as well as the current partnership to develop a migration profile for Mozambique, which will pave the way for Mozambique's first National Migration Policy.\n\nThe National Institute for Disaster Management (INGD) is IOM's main partner in coordinating the provision of humanitarian assistance, including Shelter/Non-Food Items, Camp Coordination and Camp Management, Displacement Tracking Matrix, Protection/Mental Health Psychosocial Support and Health for internally displaced persons and their communities in response to natural or human-induced disasters. Furthermore, IOM supports the government's efforts in preparedness and contingency planning through INGD.\n\nIOM Mozambique and the Attorney General's Office (PGR) maintain an excellent working relationship to combat trafficking in persons (TiP) and promote child protection. IOM has provided support to PGR to operationalize and strengthen the Reference Groups on Child Protection and Combating Trafficking in Persons at the provincial and district levels.19 IOM will continue to develop this key partnership. In the area of combating TiP and smuggling of migrants, IOM closely collaborates with the investigation police (SERNIC). Other entities of the Mozambican National Police (PRM) also cooperate with IOM for programme implementation. For example, the Community Policing Department and IOM established a strong working relationship to review the department's strategy and implement it in northern Mozambique - a key thematic area under the Resilience and Durable Solutions Pillar of this strategy.\n\nIOM works continuously with the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Action (MGCAS), especially in relation to the provision of direct assistance to migrants in vulnerable situations, such as victims of TiP, unaccompanied migrant children, returnees, smuggled migrants and other vulnerable groups.\n\nOther key governmental partners include the Ministry of Health (MISAU) and the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Services (MITESS). IOM, MISAU and MITESS work closely to promote access to health for migrants as well as to deliver occupational health services and operate occupational health centres, especially for Mozambican mine workers.\n\nAll of IOM Mozambique's programmes and operations are guided by and support the Government of Mozambique. IOM Mozambique aims to further strengthen collaboration with the government and to remain a key partner in all aspects related to migration and displacement in Mozambique.\n\nIOM MOZAMBIQUE42\n\nIOM and International Partners IOM joined the United Nations as a related agency in 2016. Well-before this date, IOM in Mozambique has been a key partner of the United Nations family in the country. IOM is a committed member of the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) and the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) and other relevant coordination and working groups at various technical levels. IOM is an active actor in the ongoing process to develop the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 2022-2026. IOM remains committed to coordinate its interventions with relevant agencies to increase efficiency and capacity to deliver.\n\nOver the years, IOM has implemented numerous Joint Programmes with other UN agencies, including the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Population Fund, the Word Food Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization and others. IOM aims to expand joint programming with UN agencies, building on their comparative advantage and strengths to provide a service of the highest possible standards to the Government and people of Mozambique.\n\nIOM and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) / Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)\n\nIOM recognizes the importance and significant contribution of NGOs and CSOs to the sustainable development of Mozambique as well as to the well-being of migrants and society. IOM regularly cooperates with CSOs and invites them to participate in relevant cooperation platforms. For instance, in the area of protection of persons with albinism, or in the area of promoting occupational health to Mozambican mine workers, the collaboration with CSOs has proven to be extremely valuable. Furthermore, several CSOs are part of the Reference Groups on Child Protection and Combating Trafficking in Persons, which are chaired by PGR. While these are a few examples of positive interactions, IOM Mozambique will continue to expand its cooperation with relevant CSOs in Mozambique across various programmes.\n\nIOM and the Private Sector\n\nIOM Mozambique is aware of the important role that the private sector as well as Private-Public Partnerships (PPPs) play for the sustainable development of Mozambique. For example, IOM has an ongoing partnership with Shell for the promotion of access to sustainable energy in resettlement sites in Sofala and Manica provinces. IOM Mozambique also collaborated with private-public institutions such as GAPISociedade to provide reintegration assistance and vocational training to Mozambican returnees from South Africa. While these initiatives added significant value to specific interventions, IOM Mozambique will explore possibilities to further expand and strengthen its partnership with relevant private sector entities as well as PPPs.\n\nIOM assisted the Government of Mozambique in preparations for the arrival of Cyclone Eloise, moving people to safety in accommodation centers in Buzi. © INGD January 2021\n\nIOM MOZAMBIQUE43\n\nMONITORING, EVALUATION,\n\nACCOUNTABILITY AND LEARNING (MEAL)\n\nIOM Mozambique is committed to results-based management, emphasizing on the impact and continuous improvement of service delivery across its pillars of intervention. The implementation of an effective monitoring, evaluation, accountability and learning system is thus a key component to ensure IOM Mozambique programming is evidence-based, flexible, effective and accountable.\n\nMonitoring\n\nIOM will mainstream monitoring as a core component of project and programme implementation to drive evidencebased decision-making and programming. From project and programme development, IOM will develop monitoring plans leveraging its pool of expertise to adapt globally validated tools to specific contexts and needs. Monitoring plans will gather quantitative and qualitative data to measure the quality and reach of IOM activities in terms of results, effects and impact. The tools and sampling methods will be thorough, to ensure monitoring data is gathered from all target groups, especially the most vulnerable.\n\nAccountability\n\nAs part of its strategy, IOM Mozambique commits to being accountable to beneficiaries, the Government, partners, donors and other stakeholders through reciprocal communication channels. IOM Mozambique's communication strategy will be informed by monitoring data that will ensure the adaptation of actions to the needs of beneficiaries and other stakeholders. In emergency and conflict-affected areas, IOM will ensure that tailored and accessible feedback mechanisms are in place, following the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Commitment on Accountability to Affected Populations.\n\nLearning\n\nTo promote the continuous improvement and development of IOM, staff and partners alike, IOM Mozambique will mainstream learning as a key component of its work. Through effective monitoring, evaluation and accountability, IOM will continuously gather and share best practices, lessons learned and recommendations that can promote improved service delivery and efficiency.\n\nCoordination\n\nIOM's MEAL strategy will contribute to the efforts made by the UN Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group (MERG) to ensure data and learnings are shared and received from other UN agencies. IOM will also promote collaboration and capacity-building of partners to improve and implement joint monitoring, evaluation, accountability and learning mechanisms.\n\nIn cooperation with the Government of Mozambique, IOM facilitated transportation for displaced families from Guara-Guara to return to their areas of origin and reside in a resettlement site following Cyclone Idai. © IOM April 2019/Sandra BLACK\n\nIOM MOZAMBIQUE44\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS AND VISIBILITY\n\nAs IOM activities in Mozambique expand and adapt to respond to evolving migration dynamics, there is increased need for robust communication and visibility to share migration related data, to communicate needs of vulnerable populations and to share joint program achievements.\n\nTo achieve the mission of serving as a key source of information for migration related data, IOM Mozambique works through established partnerships with Government of Mozambique, academia, civil society and development partners.\n\nThese partners work in concert to conduct research, build national capacity and inform humanitarian response. IOM contributes to the national and regional discourse on migration through production of publications, support for migration-related events and media engagement.\n\nIOM Mozambique's communications and visibility framework establishes two-way communication between IOM and related stakeholders and beneficiaries to ensure transparency, accountability and feedback, and to enhance collaboration in the implementation of this strategy.\n\nIOM Mozambique coordinates with UN Mozambique and IOM Headquarters to present communications materials on accessible platforms including social media, press releases, and website. Together with national partners, the goal is to establish clear steps for the development of communication campaigns, including message development, audience identification, dissemination and feedback.\n\nMaterials are designed to improve understanding of the migration experience. Throughout the process, high value is placed on communication in multiple languages, messaging via a variety of formats, and focused employment of means most effective and appropriate to local consumption and needs of media. Production of clear, informative and useful materials in print and online formats, including social media is vital to enhance communications and program visibility. Response to requests from media and engagement with journalists in coordination with the Government of Mozambique, facilitates dissemination of messages through media. Together with outreach and awareness-raising activities through community radio campaigns, mobile brigades and sensitization spreads essential and timely messages to facilitate IOM's programmatic efforts and improve outcomes for communities.\n\nWomen in Mandruzi Resettlement Site initiated a carpet weaving group in order to develop their livelihood and provide for their families.
