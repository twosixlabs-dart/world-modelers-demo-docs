Violent conflict dramatically disrupts traditional develop ment and can spill over borders and reduce growth and prosperity across entire regions. Although development and humanitarian assistance programs are increas ingly implemented in situations of open or latent violence, unfortunately, most still do not explicitly incorporate a sensitivity to conflict in their design or execution.\n\nThe Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) in F r o m t h e D i r e c t o r the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) was established to provide technical leadership on conflict to USAID Missions and our Washington-based regional and pillar bureaus. The vast majority of our field missions and staff are currently working in areas that are either in conflict, coming out of conflict, or are at high-risk for violence. A central objective of the office is to integrate or \"mainstream\" best practices in conflict management and mitigation into more traditional development sectors such as agriculture, economic growth, democracy, education, and health. Where appropriate, CMM will be an advocate for stable change.\n\nAs Director of CMM, I am pleased to introduce this document on land and conflict. I hope that readers will find the information contained herein thoughtful, innovative, and useful. CMM will release additional toolkits in the near future and I trust that each one will bring its own unique value to discussions about development and conflict. We consider these toolkits to be \"living documents\" and would welcome your comments and observations to help us improve future iterations.\n\nElisabeth Kvitashvili Director Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)\n\nC ov er P ho to\n\n: P an os /C en in i P ho to th is p ag e: P an os /H or ne r\n\nU S A I D O F F I C E O F C O N F L I C T M A N A G E M E N T A N D M I T I G A T I O N\n\nViolent Conflict: A Toolkit for Programming The purpose of this toolkit is to provide a practical introduction to the relationship between land and violent conflict. The relationship is stark, whether we are talking about how land issues function as causal or aggravating factors in conflict, or whether we are thinking about land-related issues that arise in post-conflict settings. The toolkit is also designed to familiarize practitioners with a range of relevant pro grammatic interventions and to sensitize officers to the fact that development activi ties, including non-land related interventions, such as infrastructure projects and the exploitation of underground resources, can inadvertently cause land conflicts to erupt.\n\nAs with many issues addressed in this series, land issues are a general develop ment concern from the perspective of economic growth, governance, and the envi ronment. However, land is also a critical 'prize' in many local and national power struggles, and any development initiative needs to be aware of this fact. The lead authors have therefore attempted to inspire creative thinking and encourage shortterm action around land related conflicts, as well as capture the relevance of land to long-term development issues. The toolkit emphasizes the critical point that land issues must be approached systematically and that, in many contexts, sequencing and process are critical not only to the sustainability of programs but also to broader issues of stability. In that regard, this document also addresses 'doing no harm' and land-related programming.\n\nIn addition to covering key issues, discussing lessons learned, and suggesting relevant program interventions, this toolkit offers a rapid appraisal guide that can help determine which land issues are most relevant to conflict in a particular setting. It also identifies existing USAID mechanisms and implementing partners that work on land issues. Monitoring and evaluation tools are currently being developed. Together, the elements of this toolkit are intended to help raise awareness about the linkages between land, development assistance, and conflict; and to assist officers integrate a conflict perspective into their land programs.\n\nThe toolkits in this series explore individual risk factors in depth. They do not identify all relevant factors linked to violence; as such, they serve as companion pieces to conflict assessments. Conflict assessments provide a broad overview of destabiliz ing patterns and trends. They sift through many potential causes of conflict and zero in on those that are most likely to lead to violence (or renewed violence) in a partic ular context. While they provide recommendations about how to make development assistance more responsive to conflict dynamics, they do not provide detailed guidance on how to design activities. The toolkits in this series fill that gap by moving from a diagnosis of the problem to a more detailed discussion of potential interventions. Together, the assessment framework and toolkits are designed to help Missions gain a deeper understanding of the forces driving violence and to develop more strategic and focused interventions.\n\nThis toolkit was initially authored by David Bledsoe (Rural Development Institute) and Michael Brown (Independent Consultant). It was subsequently revised with substantial input from officers in USAID Washington, USAID Missions, donor agencies, academic experts, and members of the NGO community. Comments, questions, and requests for additional information should be directed to the Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation.\n\nOffice of Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance United States Agency for International Development\n\nLESSONS LEARNED 8\n\nPROGRAM OPTIONS 14\n\nRESOURCES 22\n\nKEY ISSUES\n\nRAPID APPRAISAL GUIDE\n\n2 0 0 4\n\nP ho to : P an os\n\n/T el em an s\n\nLand is a very strategic socio-economic asset, particularly in poor societies where wealth and survival are measured by control of, and access to, land.\n\nP eople have fought over land since the beginning of recorded history. Population growth and environmental stresses have exacerbated the perception of land as a dwindling resource, tightening the connection between land and violent conflict. Land is often a significant factor in widespread violence and is also a critical element in peace-building and economic reconstruction in post-conflict situations.\n\nLand is therefore a very strategic socio-The Context economic asset, particularly in poor\n\nWhy is land so important? Land is a societies where wealth and survival are unique, valuable, and immovable measured by control of, and access to, resource of limited quantity. Land is not land. only the most basic aspect of subsis tence for many people around the world, Land is a central element in the varied it can also contain valuable structures and complex social relations of produc and natural resources on (or beneath) it. tion and reproduction within which 2 conflict between individuals and groups are bred. As a result, conflict over land often combines strong economic and emotional values (OECD 2004). When symbolically or emotionally important land or property is at issue, chances of conflict and violence increase significantly. It should also be kept in mind that competition over access to land is often, at its core, about power, both socio-economic and political.\n\nConflict entrepreneurs_ individuals or groups who benefit in material or political terms from violence_may endeavor to further their personal ambitions by manipulating the emotional or symbolic dimensions of land. An addi tional exacerbating factor, and entry point for conflict entrepreneurs, especial ly in developing countries, is that land often lacks adequate legal or institutional protections. Without those protections, land quickly becomes a valuable and symbolically powerful commodity easily subjected to manipulation and abuse.\n\nWeak legal, institutional and traditional/customary protections also feed heavily into the gender dimension of the land-and-conflict picture. Conflict over land, particularly involving land access and rights, disproportionately and negatively impacts women. In conflict and post-conflict situations many men have either been killed or gone missing, causing a sharp rise in the number of women-headed households. Women who do not have formal rights to land and property are left without the means to create stable and sustainable livelihoods. This situation contributes to poverty and perpetuates a cycle of social and political inequality that provides fodder for future conflict (UNIFEM 1998). Although this toolkit does not explicitly address the deeper relationship between gender and conflict (for a more detailed analysis see USAID's forthcoming Gender and Conflict Toolkit), the reader should be aware of the sometimes subtle yet critical role of gender in many landbased conflicts.\n\nIn sum, the relationship between land and conflict is extraordinarily complex. When it comes to land issues, economics and politics frequently mingle with other influences like law, public administration, and culture. Therefore, as in other conflict dynamics, land is tied to a complex network of issues ranging from power relationships to economics and from symbolic attachments to systemic inequities. Addressing land issues effectively demands a broad, integrated, and inter-disciplinary approach.\n\nLand Tenure Failures and Insecurity Land tenure refers to rights of access and use of land. Violation of insufficiently protected land tenure rights can lead to conflict and violence. Conditions influ encing tenure insecurity include rights that are:\n\nOverly limited in breadth and scope;\n\nToo short in duration to recoup invest ments;\n\nConflicting, such as: claims that are grounded in formal state law versus informal or customary claims, or where overlapping rights were granted to parties under different legal regimes, or where overlapping and competitive rights have been granted to different parties for the same land; and Inadequate or unenforceable rights.\n\nPeople with insecure tenure rights are often indiscriminately or forcibly removed from their land. In many countries, rural dwellers with weak tenure are pushed off their lands without fair compensation or due process. To move forward with state development plans in China, entire villages have been forcibly relocated without fair compensa tion (e.g., Three Gorges dam project). Tenure insecurity has been part of the dynamic of violence in many places including Uganda, Angola, Rwanda, Burundi, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Papua New Guinea, urban Peru, and Amazon River regions in Brazil and Colombia. Whenever forced evictions occur, violence is commonly used for both enforcement and defense. Known or suspected corruption also increases the likelihood of violence.\n\nThe relationship between land and conflict is extraordinarily complex. Addressing land issues effectively demands a broad, integrated, and inter-disciplinary approach\n\nTenure insecurity also arises in postconflict situations where people have competing claims to the same plot of land. For instance, in East Timor, competing land claims resulted from distinct historical periods such as colonial era titles and titles issued during illegal occupations, as well as claims based on informal customary land use. Similarly, in Kosovo, overlapping land claims between ethnic Albanians and Serbians contributed to ethnic violence, forced displacement, and destruction of urban and rural property. Well designed post-conflict activities can help resolve these types of tenure insecurity.\n\nTenure insecurity can also be trans boundary in nature and can become a regional issue. For example, at least a dozen boundary disputes resulted from the division of territory in Central Asia following the dissolution of the former Soviet Union. Many of those disputes, some of which resulted in violent clashes, were over the best farm land in the Ferghana Valley. Regional dimen sions of land and conflict are also evident in Africa, especially where boundaries are porous and groups or individuals can access and use land from both sides of a national border. Access to land is often a key factor in cross-border population movements. These movements can be destabilizing elements in already unstable situations (e.g., Côte d'Ivoire) and they can compli cate matters by bringing to the fore delicate issues concerning land-related rights held by different categories of people, such as indigenous groups, displaced peoples and foreigners, migrants and descendants of migrants, and others.\n\nCompeting Land Claims and Uses Some degree of conflict typically charac terizes a situation involving competing claims to the ownership or use of the same piece of land. Whether claims are grounded in formally recognized rights or in customary use, circumstances involving groups of people, rather than individuals, significantly intensify the risk of larger-scale violent conflict.\n\nParties will compete over the same land use or for vastly different uses; for example, pastoralists versus farmers. Competition can also play out between distinct ethnic groups or communities or even between generational factions and socio-economic groups. In some cases, government involvement that supports (or is perceived to support) one side over another can significantly increase tensions (e.g., Rwanda and Burundi). In Uganda and Kenya, warring clans of pastoralists facing resource scarcity kill each other during cattle raids as they search for productive grazing land and reliable water sources. In Mozambique, land disputes between immigrant charcoal burners and local farmers and grazers have caused violence and property damage. In Mexico, members of agrarian communities fight one another as they assert their claims to both common and privately held land; they have also had violent conflicts with the government and private developers over claims to community land. In northern Iraq, disputes over urban property spilled over into disputes over agricultural land. Many of these disputes resulted in forced displacement, destruc tion of property and loss of life.\n\nGovernment land appropriation and resettlement schemes are notorious for causing conflict and tension related to competition for land uses and claims. Frequently, a government appropriates land and forcibly moves people when it wants to use an area for an incompatible use such as a dam or natural resource development. People who were involun tarily resettled may react violently (e.g., Mozambique, Ethiopia and Nigeria). Competition and conflict can also occur when people are resettled into an area already held or occupied by others.\n\nLand-holding Inequities The likelihood of violent conflict increases substantially when gross inequities characterize land-holding patterns, particularly when a large landless or land-poor population has limited livelihood opportunities. The stakes are even higher when a margin alized population literally depends on a small piece of land for subsistence and survival. Grievances over inequities, which are deeply rooted in a strong 4\n\nU S A I D O F F I C E O F C O N F L I C T M A N A G E M E N T A N D M I T I G A T I O N P ho to : P an os /H en le y sense of injustice, also increase the probability of violence. Frustrations are usually directed toward those people who are seen as having an undeserved but profitable lock on landholdings, often going back generations. Land-holding inequities, combined with other drivers of violence, have been critical elements in many conflicts throughout history. Examples include the Mexican Revolution of 1912, the Spanish Civil War in 1936-1939, Chinese revolution that brought the Communists to power in 1949, Cuban revolution in 1959, Vietnam conflict that ended for the US in 1975, and the civil war in El Salvador in the 1980s. Land-holding inequities also represent an underlying factor in the violence that has occurred more recently in countries such as Zimbabwe, Brazil, Nepal, Guatemala, and Venezuela; and could potentially impact the situation in South Africa, Namibia and some parts of Central Asia (including Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan).\n\nIt is not uncommon to find individuals involved, such as conflict entrepreneurs, who manipulate a disgruntled population to achieve personal political or material gain (as in the cases of Rwanda and Burundi), or to achieve gains for a specific group or socio-economic class within an ethnic or political group.\n\nViolence may be expressed through targeted outbursts often associated with land occupations, as we have seen over the last several years in both Zimbabwe and Brazil. Violence may also be associ ated with an angry backlash against those demanding or taking land. For example, owners of large land holdings may forcibly resist change or attempt to return to earlier holding patterns in which they were the beneficiaries. Chile in the 1970s provides an example of violent retaliation partly driven by dispos sessed large landholders.\n\nDisplacement and Return of Populations In many countries, government sponsored resettlement schemes have led to conflict among the \"settled\" as well as between the settled population and the original inhabitants. These types of conflict have occurred in Tanzania, Nigeria, Mozambique and Angola. In the cases of Mozambique and Angola, forced settlement schemes led to both the wars for independence and also contributed to the civil wars following independence.\n\nResettlement schemes and/or violent conflict can displace people from their homes and lands. Tension and violence\n\nGovernment land appropriation and resettlement schemes are notorious for causing conflict and tension related to competition for land uses and claims.\n\n/P iro zz i\n\nThe likelihood of violent conflict increases substantially when gross inequities characterize land-holding patterns, particularly when a large landless or land-poor population has limited livelihood opportunities. often accompany the initial displacement and can also be part of the dynamic when displaced people return to their place of origin, especially when others have since taken up occupancy. The dis placement can be intentional or can be an unintended consequence of broader dynamics such as war or natural disasters.\n\nIn Kosovo, an important part of the 1999 conflict dynamic involved the forced expulsion and displacement of more than one million ethnic Albanians. Upon their return, reprisals against the Serbs forced many Serbs to flee Kosovo. Tensions continue to fester between Serbs in Serbia and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo as Serbs threaten to take back their land and/or demand compensation for their losses. In the Indonesian case, the government policy of Javanese colo nization has involved large-scale popula tion resettlement from the main crowded island to other parts of the archipelago, resulting in numerous land seizures for the benefit of the settlers. Resettlement schemes in Indonesia have had major repercussions, including violence between indigenous groups and settlers that have driven several states, including Indonesian Papua, to the verge of civil war.\n\nIn East Timor (while under Indonesian occupation) and in Colombia, entire rural communities have been \"strategically displaced\" to facilitate control over their land for purposes related to armed conflict and illicit trade. In addition to dif ficulties related directly to the violence, displaced people also often suffer from human rights violations, famine, disease and other negative impacts associated with dislocation. The legacy of forced resettlement is also characterized by ongoing tense land disputes with contin uing potential for violence.\n\nIn some instances, including the Mano River countries and Côte d'Ivoire, refugees and other involuntary migrants seek refuge in local communities rather than in refugee camps. The degree of integration between refugee/migrant and host populations is often shaped by the sustainability of the arrangements agreed regarding land access and use. Evidence from the field has shown that there are close linkages between conflict zones and zones of involuntary migration, making it a priority for devel opment practitioners to be aware of the relationship between involuntary migration, land access and the spread of conflict zones.\n\nPost-Conflict Land Issues As countries emerge from armed conflict, they face a number of landrelated challenges associated with postconflict reconstruction and peace con solidation. The importance of land issues to post-conflict development is often not recognized early enough, and, even when it is recognized, it is often politically or practically unfeasible to effectively address those issues in the immediate post-conflict period. Nevertheless, Disputes typically appear when other individuals or groups are found occupying the properties of a returning population (e.g., Rwanda and Burundi). In such cases, the returning population may be forced to occupy alternative properties that are not actually theirs, which can instigate another set of disputes and related secondary complications. Additionally, a range of other land-based disputes will almost inevitably come to the surface as the dust settles in the aftermath of conflict (e.g., Mozambique and Angola). Post-conflict settings often see dramatic shifts in political power, attempts to settle \"old scores\" and/or the establish ment of new land laws; any of these can precipitate land disputes.\n\nSome post-conflict settings, such as East Timor and Afghanistan, have involved dramatic periods of transitional governance. In these cases, land issues will have to be managed within a transi tional context as the groundwork is laid for democratic elections. While no formula specifies how this must be done, it requires a careful balance of political sensitivity and substantive land expertise. Issues generally arise regarding land law and policy; gover nance and the management of natural resources (i.e., local power relations); land administration, including property registration, land titling, and cadastre; 6 land use; and the establishment of the foundations for government land agencies.\n\nThe property registry system can also be a specific target of violence, carrying with it a number of special challenges. In the case of East Timor, land registry offices throughout the country were burned down; nearly all land titles were destroyed and land registry books were stolen. In Bosnia-Herzegovina many of the land registry books were also burned or stolen, while others were taken out of country, never to be retrieved. Property registration issues can be an obstacle to peace and, therefore, should receive more attention from policy makers and donors during the immediate post conflict period.\n\nTriggering Events and Conducive Settings Background conflict factors combined with specific conflict typologies may not actually spill over into open conflict and violence unless sparked by triggering events within settings that are conducive to violence. For example, massive violence and destruction of property in East Timor was made possible in part because segments of the population had been strategically organized and appro priately armed in advance. An armed population frequently implies added risk that situations can turn violent. Extraordinary political events can also trigger conflict and violence by sending a shock wave through the political system. In Rwanda, the death of the president sparked the violence, destruc tion, and genocide that took place in 1994. Tenure insecurity and competing land claims exacerbated that conflict, making land conflicts an important piece of the dynamic in Rwanda.\n\nEnvironmental disasters and follow-up crisis responses can also provide a context in which tensions can overflow into violence. For instance, environmen tal refugees displaced by loss of land often put added pressure on access to other lands.\n\nKe y\n\nIs su es\n\nThe importance of land issues to post-conflict development is often not recognized early enough, and, even when it is recognized, it is often politically or practically unfeasible to effectively address those issues in the immediate post-conflict period.\n\n/C en in i\n\nConflict assessments, including land tenure appraisal, are valuable tools for clarifying the real and potential linkages between land issues and violent conflict\n\nMany lessons are emerging as development practitioners pay greater attention to the relationships between land and violent conflict. While no single formula can explain how to plan successful programmatic interventions to address land and violent conflict, several important factors help ensure that programmatic thinking moves in the right direction. At a minimum, the starting point should always be to \"do no harm.\"\n\nFraming Interventions justice, developing new legislation or policies under rule of law, strengthening 1by Sector relevant government land agencies or\n\nLand issues are multidisciplinary, often civil society organizations; cutting across the traditional sectoral and Economic growth-tenure security thematic divisions used within USAID.

On the positive side, the crosssectoral aspect of land issues sometimes allows for piecemeal selection of how to frame interventions in the most strategic way for a given context. For example, would a host government be more responsive to land interventions targeted toward economic growth, or would an activity that focuses on environment, natural resource management, or increased agricultural productivity garner the most support? Choosing the best way to frame interventions requires under standing of a country's land issues and how they connect to conflict. In that regard, conflict assessments, including land tenure appraisal, are valuable tools for clarifying the real and potential linkages between land issues and violent conflict.\n\nImproving Land Access\n\nToday, a \"menu\" of approaches helps facilitate broader access to land and engenders greater equality in economic opportunity. In the past, land was typically taken from large landholders and redistributed to the \"land-needy\" by way of expropriation, usually with com pensation or channeled through land funds. Increasingly, market-mediated and community-managed efforts are being explored, including land rental market facilitation. While state-managed and expropriation-based reforms are not commonly used today, this model is at the root of thriving and equitable land holding patterns in a few countries, including Japan and Taiwan. Despite best intentions, however, history has shown that conflict can arise when large landholders incur uncompensated losses and/or a politicized and confrontational process of redistribution, without due process, results in negative economic consequences from the direct destruction of productive enterprise and a decline in security of rights. Experience has also shown that land reform approaches sustain peace only when they succeed in achieving broader access to land within an environment of improved productivity and income for new land-holders and more agricultural growth in general.\n\nIn market-based, community-managed models, land-poor communities receive support, such as credit, grants, and technical assistance, to identify and purchase land from established landowners. Market-assisted initiatives can be geographically focused and strategically crafted to target certain populations and/or conflict hotspots. Various countries have tried this approach in recent years, including South Africa, Brazil, Namibia, Kyrgyzstan, and some pilot experimenta tion in Uzbekistan. While criticized by some for being costly, similar critiques were made of state-managed, expropriation-based approaches in the past. Implementation approaches are being reviewed and refined to improve both the costs and benefits of these efforts.\n\nActivating or improving land rental markets in ways that make property more accessible to new tenants might also be cost effective, as has happened in Moldova, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan. In Guatemala, land rental is being explored alongside a land fund that helps peasant groups purchase land. For this scheme to work, rental contracts must be sufficiently equitable and of long enough duration to motivate investment in and conservation of the rental property. The rights of the owner must also be secure. Rental markets can also facilitate the consolidation of fragmented parcels of land into larger, more economically viable units.\n\nAnother variation in approach to improving land access is the allocation of immediately available or accessible state-owned land, such as colonization schemes (e.g., Honduras in the 1970s). Public lands might be made available through a variety of sources:\n\nPublic lands available for legal distribu tion, for example, via divestiture of state farms and cooperatives as has happened in Africa (Mozambique) and Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Moldova, Russia and parts of Central Asia). Additionally, a\n\nLand-related interventions require careful internal and intra-institutional coordination to avoid slowdowns or unproductive delays\n\nLe ss on s\n\nLe ar ne d number of countries in Eastern Europe have \"restituted\" land back to former owners. In several cases in Eastern Europe and Eurasia limited access to pro ductive resources was a contributing factor in local conflict, to which govern ments responded by making land available to citizens through divestiture and restitution;\n\nLand that falls under state control because it was illegally appropriated in the first place or because a debt is defaulted on;\n\nPrivately titled land left dormant long enough to revert back to state control according to the national land legislation; or\n\nLand that becomes productive through publicly funded irrigation projects and is thus available for re-distribution.\n\nIncreasing Tenure 3 Security Tenure insecurity is generally addressed through tenure clarification, land titling and registration initiatives. Depending on the circumstances, initiatives that demarcate and record land tenure without going as far as granting formal titles can improve tenure security for customary or indigenous rights holders.\n\nNevertheless, land titling alone does not necessarily improve peoples' livelihoods, especially when other aspects of an enabling environment are weak. Social and economic impacts of titling initiatives increase significantly when credit, infra structure, and technical assistance services are available. When institutions are weak, rights are unclear, or overlap ping claims exist, land titling and registra tion efforts can ignite or provoke conflict. Therefore, approaches that incorporate dispute mitigation and consensus-building measures and that work to clarify rights by legal reform are needed.\n\nIdentifying and4 Resolving Competing Claims\n\nWould-be interventionists must properly understand land claims and land-andconflict situations before deciding among the various means of resolving disputes. A focused study can help clarify key issues such as competing claims or existing conflicts as well as potential options for resolution. It is important to keep in mind that there are nearly always multiple sides in a conflict situation, often with differing perspectives and wielding what they believe to be legitimate claims. Care must be taken to approach interventions with neutrality and not to \"demonize\" or \"sym pathize\" with one party or another, risking a politicized process.\n\nConflicting claims commonly emerge over time as a result of contradictions, gaps, and uncertainties in a country's land law and policy regime. Appropriate legislative and policy reform is often required to prevent continued disputes. Competing claims that involve conflicting legal rights might require court proceed ings to be effectively resolved, although there are exceptions (see the case of Kyrgyzstan cited below). The capacity of the courts for this task must be consid ered and interventions directed toward strengthening the courts might be required. In some contexts, specialized land courts have proven helpful to dispute resolution.\n\nOn the other hand, experience has also shown that many types of land disputes are best managed outside the courts. Limited court capacity to process land claims efficiently and transparently is a serious constraint in many places. Thus, alternative dispute resolution processes, especially mediation and arbitration, can be useful, while customary and community-based mechanisms for conflict resolution may be relevant in some cases. Property commissions or claims commissions may also be pertinent to certain post-conflict contexts.\n\nAddressing Post-Conflict Land Issues As countries emerge from armed conflict, they face multiple land-related challenges associated with post-conflict reconstruction and peace consolidation. Relevant land issues must be clearly understood and given appropriate priority because successful management of these issues can be critical to stabiliza tion efforts. Information about land 10 5 issues must be collected as early as possible through reconnaissance missions, conflict assessments, or other appropriate studies.\n\nVarious conflict-resolution techniques, as described earlier, have potential relevance to post-conflict settings. Two non-judicial dispute resolution techniques, in particular, warrant special emphasis. First, property or claims commissions can play a key role in post-conflict situations where processes of reconciliation and property restitution need to be addressed in significant numbers. These commis sions can facilitate dialogue and data col lection while dealing with competing claims, resettlement, and compensation in the aftermath of conflicts involving large-scale population displacements. Promising cases, including Cyprus and to some extent Bosnia-Herzegovina, suggest that sustained donor intervention is a key factor for success. Efforts at facil itated repatriation, whereby the displaced are helped to return to their homes or to find new property, can be highly effective in preventing conflict and diminishing future tensions if the efforts are well coor dinated and sufficiently funded. Many of these potential solutions need to be finessed and some will simply be \"stop gap\" measures designed to reduce the potential for a resumption of hostilities while more lasting, long-term solutions are worked out. Second, local community-based and customary conflictresolution mechanisms can offer effective and acceptable means of managing many kinds of land conflicts. Experience in East Timor and Kyrgyzstan showed that building on socially legitimate informal institutions was an effective way to manage a large number of post-conflict land disputes.\n\nIn post-conflict settings, investment in agricultural infrastructure, technical assistance, and the creation of market linkages can complement land policy approaches by creating and supporting new income-generating opportunities. Fostering agricultural productivity can prevent the outbreak of food crises and create employment as well as other economic opportunities.\n\nUsing Complementary6Activities/Approaches Various other activities, including nonland-related interventions, can be, alone or combined with other interventions, useful in different contexts.\n\nPublic education and information campaigns Lack of accurate information about land rights and other land issues can fuel confusion and suspicion that can lead to conflict. Early public information and education campaigns about land-related issues can help to clarify issues and correct false assumptions. When the campaigns focus on law and land rights, mechanisms may be needed to ensure access to some kind of legal assistance for those who need it.\n\nLegal advice and orientation Lack of knowledge or understanding about the law and land rights (frequently a problem in poor communities) can also contribute to tension and conflict. Community-based legal assistance, advice, and orientation initiatives that work with local people and organizations can be effective in addressing these problems. The nature of the justice system in a given country will also influence project design. For example, educating people about their rights-onpaper in a system where they have no opportunity to defend their rights-inpractice will cause frustration. Linking legal advice and orientation to processes that will protect land rights or resolve land conflicts is extremely important and is often done in conjunc tion with public information and education campaigns.\n\nJustice initiatives Activities that focus primarily on strengthening the justice system and rule of law may have relevance to land issues, such as targeted institutional strengthening or capacity building to promote more efficient handling of land disputes. Initiatives and other support could focus on the formal justice system or on non-judicial conflict-resolution mechanisms.\n\nInformation about land issues must be collected as early as possible through reconnaissance missions, conflict assessments, or other appropriate studies. ne d Local government and/or Creating alternative job local citizen participation and livelihood opportunities\n\nA range of initiatives targeting local gov- Approaches that develop relevant, ernment and/or citizen involvement can appropriate and, preferably, sustainable positively influence land conflict issues. job or livelihood opportunities can signifiFor example, strengthening local institu- cantly diminish pressures related to land tions to improve transparency and inequities.

In post-conflict settings, targeting opportunities toward members of society who are most likely to be involved in violent conflict (e.g., demobilized war veterans and young males) may help prevent continued and future violence.\n\nWant to know more? In Land Policies for Growth and Poverty Reduction (2003), Klaus Deininger provides readers with a comprehensive compilation of experiential and conceptual information on land policy and administration. The World Bank report finds that providing poor people secure tenure and facilitating land transactions can be key to a wide range of social and economic benefits, including improved governance, empowerment of women and other marginalized people, increased private investment, and more rapid economic growth and poverty reduction.

Authors Nicolas Pons-Vignon and Henri-Bernard Solignac Lecomte offer recommendations on tackling land issues in recipient countries more sys tematically while taking specific sensitivities and grievances into account.

In a land-transfer program following El Salvador's civil war, land was purchased and resold to beneficiar ies, as defined by the peace accord (such as demobilized fighters), with land titles given to groups of families for expediency. Subsequently, an initiative was established to facilitate community decision-making and dispute resolution to determine which lands would be sub divided and which would remain communal tenure. Delineation of parcel boundaries, land titling, and registration were done interactively with community groups. Local NGOs were trained to facilitate the process. The program brought tenure security to almost 30,000 families resettled after the civil war. www.rlc.fao.org/prior/desrural/tenencia/p df/salvador.pdf\n\nIncreasing and2Protecting Tenure Security Demarcation and Titling of Customary Common Property. In Angola, rural communities establish, demarcate, and title important commonproperty used for dwellings and crops as well as for common pursuits such as cattle grazing, in order to protect these customary holdings from governmentissued land concessions, commercial interests, and other communities. Local officials and elders from the target and surrounding communities reach consensus about the land's boundaries, size, and use. The tract is mapped, titled, and registered with the local agri culture ministry, pending new land legis lation, without national legal authoriza tion. The newly registered maps and\n\nM A N A G E M E N T A N D M I T I G A T I O N titles serve as formal notice to those who seek to encroach upon the land or usurp traditional land rights. The initia tive is modeled on a similar program in Mozambique and is similar to approach es used with indigenous communities in Bolivia. www.oxfam.org.uk Titling in the land reform sector. After nearly a century of land redistribu tion, second-generation reform in Mexico in the early 1990s helped improve tenure security in the reform sector and allowed reform beneficiaries the choice to partici pate in markets. PROCEDE (Programa de Certificación de Derechos Ejidales y Titulación de Solares Urbanos), a program of certification of individual rights to farm plots, common land and urban lots within the communities, is almost 80 percent completed. Meanwhle, new insti tutions for conflict resolution were initiated to accompany PROCEDE. This Mexican approach to titling is a good example of successful resolution of conflicts through open itinerant tribunals, access to an ombudsman, community participation, transparency, required approval by neighbors prior to titling, and appeals rights. It also illustrates a flexible approach in a transitional period to accommodating different economic and cultural views on land tenure. Marking boundaries without full ownership was a very constructive first step in reducing conflictiveness. Moreover, based in community decisions-making, farmers can make the transition from social and communal ownership to private property and individual rights. www.pa.gob.mx Legal Assistance to Rural Citizens. Specially trained Kyrgyz lawyers, located within legal aid centers across the country, help rural citizens exercise new legal land tenure and transaction rights through the \"Legal Assistance to Rural Citizens\" (LARC) project. These lawyer advocates take land cases through administrative or judicial adjudication processes, winning most cases. They also provide public education and legal consultation to gov ernment leaders and other Kyrgyz lawyers, including a monthly newsletter on land law matters.

In three oblasts in the Kyrgyz Republic that experience frequent land conflicts, local leaders have been trained to help villagers protect and exercise land rights. Seven full-time local legal advisors/advocates were trained in the content and exercise of the country's rel atively progressive land laws. They, in turn, trained and worked regularly with 176 local leaders from 66 villages. These local leaders then served as advocates on behalf of local land rights holders, assisting more than 4,000 citizens in one year to take action to resolve land conflicts with local officials and collectivefarm bosses. www.rdiland.org\n\nIdentifying and3Resolving Conflicting Claims to Land Land Titling and Claim Adjudication through Community Paralegals. As a part of the \"Sustainable Use of Biological Resources\" (SUBIR) program in Ecuador, this effort facilitated resolution of many conflicting land use and ownership grievances. Local communi ties and indigenous organizations selected paralegals to become special ists in land rights, land use, natural resource management, and conflict management. The paralegals facilitate mediation and conflict resolution regarding the legal aspects of land rights and the process of land titling as well as educate communities about their rights. These people were chosen for the job because they already had legitimacy in the community and were familiar with the conflicts. www.care.org.ec/subir/\n\nThe Use of Community Radio to Prevent Conflict through Pubic Education. The multi-country \"Community Radio Initiatives to Stop Conflict\" program addresses competition over land resources. In Mali, community radio helped quell a dispute between cattle grazers and farmers. The community radio station produced public service announcements that reminded competing users about the area's tradi tional practice of cooperative land use and also urged farmers to post radio bulletins when harvesting was finished so that grazers would know they could cross the farmlands without trampling crops. This grassroots conflict preven tion approach prompted groups to cooperate in their use of a limited and fragile resource. Journalism initiatives have also helped resolve competition over resources in Colombia, Afghanistan, and Liberia. www.neareast.org\n\nResponding to4Population Displacement and Return Ideas for Temporarily Housing Returning Populations. In East Timor, the international community did not ade quately coordinate a situation in which more than 75 percent of the population was displaced from their land and homes. As people began to return and move about the country with little official restraint or direction, many began to occupy houses that were not their own. Violence resulted and an informal leasing market of non-owned properties quickly sprang up. Possible preventative options could have included a rapid but temporary diversion of refugees and internally displaced persons into transit housing; the use of state or officially controlled properties to locate these temporary housing centers; and the establishment of \"tent cities\" or other temporary structures to house the displaced people. www.reliefweb.int\n\nU S A I D O F F I C E O F C O N F L I C T M A N A G E M E N T A N D M I T I G A T I O N P ho to : P an os /H or ne r Assistance to Returning Populations on Property Matters. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, a property assistance program for internally displaced people and returnees counter acted harassment and security issues faced by minority populations as they attempted to return to their homes, which were often illegally occupied by others. A network of legal aid and infor mation centers assisted with property claims and related restitution matters. The network also educated returnees about their rights and obligations, helped prepare claims, and helped push the claims through a confusing and slow restitution process. www.unhcr.ba\n\nPost-Conflict Land Issues Developing Land Law and Policy in a Post-Conflict Setting. In East Timor the \"Land Law Program\" works through a three-way partnership between the implementer, government land agency, and a national university research institute. Using Timoresespecific information, work includes developing policy recommendations, helping draft legislation on land conflict resolution through mediation, linking local/traditional practices to the formal justice system, and technical and legal land registration.

The Program \"Culture of Dialogue: Development of Resources for Peacebuilding\" (OAS/PROPAZ) in Guatemala works to build government and civil society capacity to promote dialogue and the peaceful resolution of disputes. The program focused heavily on resolving land conflict issues, which are prevalent in Guatemala. To help create conditions and processes to enable a transition from confrontation toward a culture of greater dialogue, the program provided training in communi cation and conflict resolution skills, negotiation, mediation and conciliation to a variety of Guatemalan actors working on land issues at different levels of society, including government and peasant and indigenous groups. www.upd.oas.org\n\nIn the Kyrgyz Republic the use of local leaders to help address disputes has allowed resolution to take place within the community's semi-formal institutional structures in a way that did not contravene the prevalent customary respect for community, informal process, and a disinclination to challenge authority. been designed to assist development officers as they seek to most relevant to violent conflict in programmatic interventions may be of greatest relevance in each case. development of improved terms of activity designs.

This includes: developing programs related to alleviating inequities in land holdings and improving land tenure security, institutional capacity building for land management, identify ing and resolving land disputes, responding to population displacement and return and post-conflict land issues. Programs may include activities such as developing or supporting community decision-making and community-based dispute resolution processes related to land use, similar to the USAID-funded USAID Contracting Mechanisms for Land and Conflict Programming land programs in El Salvador and East Timor. In addition, this mechanism can assist in developing alternative job and livelihood opportunities. The RAISE consortia can take on task orders up to four years in duration and can undertake an intermediate results effort or a results package or activity, simply develop a country or regional strategy, or design a new activity. Furthermore, RAISE can design as well as implement activities without disqualifying firms involved in the design, as long as both stages are done under RAISE. RAISE consortia may pool expertise to collaborate and co-finance state-of-the-art approaches to address various program options such as those presented in this toolkit. RAISE Plus, the follow up mechanism to RAISE, will also be available by December 2004.
