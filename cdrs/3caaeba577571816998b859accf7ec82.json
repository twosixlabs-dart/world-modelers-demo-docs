Due to poor rainfall since November western Namibia is in a severe drought. Conditions may worsen as limited rain is forecast next week.\n\n2. In southwestern Madagascar, an uneven and inadequate rainfall distribution since the start of the rainfall season has resulted in severe drought. Drought conditions are likely to persist.\n\n3. In northwestern Angola, little to no rainfall is forecast next week, which could increase moisture deficits and worsen conditions on the ground.\n\n4. Below-average rain over the past four weeks has led to large moisture deficits and poor ground conditions over portions of the Nampula province of northern Mozambique.\n\n5. Poorly-distributed rain since late February has resulted in abnormal dryness across central and northeastern Ethiopia. Scattered light rain in the region next week may not be sufficient to overcome deficits.\n\n1 2\n\n1 4\n\nWeather Hazards Summary\n\nAfrica Overview\n\nBelow-average rainfall season recorded in northern Ethiopia Central and northeastern Ethiopia has received poor and belowaverage rain since late February, while its southern counterpart has accumulated favorable and above-average rain totals (Figure 1). Rainfall amounts between 25-50mm were recorded over the Oromiya and SNNPR of southern Ethiopia, while rainfall amounts between 5-25mm only were registered over the north-central. The uneven rainfall distribution over the past thirty days has resulted in deficits ranging between 10-50mm even exceeding 50mm over some areas of central Ethiopia. In contrast, rainfall surpluses between 50-200mm were observed to the south from southern Ethiopia, Kenya, parts of southern Somalia, to Tanzania.\n\nOver southern Africa, large thirty-day negative anomalies persisted over northwestern Angola, portions of northern Mozambique, and southern Madagascar due to a significant decrease in rainfall since late February. Conversely, positive rainfall anomalies were observed over the central portions of southern Africa, including southern Angola, Zambia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, central South Africa, and much of Mozambique. As rain is expected to gradually subside over southern Africa during the upcoming months, dry conditions are likely to worsen.\n\nDownpours caused flooding in South Africa last week Last week, abundant rain fell over southern Angola, northern Namibia, and central South Africa (Figure 2). In South Africa, the torrential rain resulted in flooding and sinkholes. While light rain prevailed elsewhere, little to no rainfall was recorded in northwestern Angola, northern Zimbabwe, southern Zambia, central Mozambique, and central Madagascar.\n\nIn the Horn of Africa, scattered moderate to heavy rain continued in southern Ethiopia, Kenya, and southern Somalia, while light rain was recorded over north-central Ethiopia. The continuation of wet conditions over the southern portions of Equatorial Eastern Africa may benefit ground conditions over many local areas. However, oversaturation could also cause flooding.\n\nNext week, light rain is forecast over Ethiopia, which could help to partially reduce deficits over some local areas. In southern Africa, moderate to heavy rain is expected to continue over Angola and northern Namibia, while suppressed rain is forecast over Botswana and northern South Africa.\n\nSource: NOAA/CPC\n\nNote: The hazards outlook map on page 1 is based on current weather/climate information and short and medium range weather forecasts (up to 1 week).

Based on rainfall data from the Ethiopian N tional Meteo ological Agency, rainfall amounts betwe n 25-50 mm were recorded ove the Oromiya and SNNPR of southern Ethiopia, while rainfall amounts between 5-25 mm only were registered over the north-central. The uneven rainfall distribution over the past thirty days has resulted in deficits ranging between 10-50 mm even exceeding 50 mm over some areas of central Ethiopia. In contrast, rainfall surpluses between 50-200 mm were observed to the south from southern Ethiopia, Kenya, parts of southern Somalia, to Tanzania.\n\nOver southern Africa, large thirty-day negative anomalies persisted over northwestern Angol, portions f northern Mozambique, and souther Madagascar due to a significant decrease in rainfall sinc late February. Conv rsely, positive rainfall anomalies were observed over the central portions of southern Africa, including southern Angola, Zambia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, central South Africa, and much of Mozambique. As rain is, generally, expected to gradually subside over southern Africa during the upcoming months, continued decreased rain is likely to worsen conditions over the dry portions of the subregion. Farther north, in the Horn of Africa, insufficient rain also would negatively impact agricultural and pastoral activities during the March-May rainfall season.\n\nHeavy downpours caused flooding over the Gauteng Province of South Africa during the past week.\n\nFrom March 21-27, abundant rain fell over southern Angola, northern Namibia, and central South Africa (Figure 2). In South Africa, the torrential and well above-average rain resulted in flooding, disrupted traffic, destroyed homes, and sinkholes. While light t locally mode ate rain prevailed elsewhere, limited with little to no r inf ll was recorded in northwestern Angola, northern Zimbabwe, southern Zambia, central Mozambique, and central Madagascar.\n\nIn the Horn of Africa, scattered moderate to heavy rain continued and was observed over southern Ethiopia, Kenya, and southern Somalia, while limited and reduced rain was registered over north-central Ethiopia. The continuation of wet conditions over the southern portions of Equatorial Eastern Africa may benefit ground conditions over many local areas. However, oversaturation could also cause flooding and threaten the livelihoods of people over some areas.\n\nDuring the next week, light to locally moderate rain is forecast over Ethiopia, which could help to partially reduce deficits over some local areas. In southern Africa, moderate to heavy rain is expected to continue over Angola and northern Namibia, while suppressed rain is forecast over Botswana and northern South Africa.\n\nSatellite Estimated Rainfall Anomaly (mm) Valid: February 26 - March 27, 2018\n\nFigure 1: NOAA/CPC\n\n7-Day Satellite Estimated Rainfall (mm) Valid: Mar 21 - March 27, 2018\n\nFigure 2: NOAA/CPC\n\nIn the Greater H rn of Africa, a comparison of the cumulative rain since late February with the long-term average has indicated that central and northeastern Ethi pia has received poor a d below-av rage rain, while its south rn counterpart has accumulated favor ble and above-average r in (Figure 1). Based on rainfall d ta from the Ethiopian National Meteorological Agency, rainf ll amounts between 25-50 mm wer recorded over the Oromiya and SNNPR of southern Ethiopi, while rai fall amou ts betwee 5-25 mm only wer r gistered over the north-central.

In contrast, rainfall surpluses between 50-200 mm were observed to th south from south rn Ethiopia, Kenya, parts of s uther Somalia, to Tanzania.\n\nOver southern Africa, large thirty-day negative anomalies persisted over northwestern Angola, portions of northern Mozambiqu, and southern Madagascar due t a sig ificant decrease in rainfall since late February. Conv rsely, positive rainfall anomalies were observed over the central portion of southern Africa, including southern Angola, Zambia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, central South Africa, and much of Mozambique. As rain is, gener lly, expected to gradually subside over southern Afric during the upcoming months, continued decreased rain is likely to worsen conditions ver the dry portions of the subregion. Farther north, in the Horn of Africa, insufficient rain also would negatively impact agricultural and pastoral activities during the March-May rainfall season.\n\nFr m March 21-27, abundant rain f ll over southern Angola, northern Namibia, and central South Africa (Figure 2). In South Africa, the torrential and well bov -average rain resulted in flooding, disrupted traffic, destroyed homes, and si kh les. While light t locally moderate rain pre ailed elsewh re, limited with little to no rainfall was rec rded in northwestern Angola, northern Zimb bwe, southern Z mbia, central Mozamb que, and central Madagasc r.\n\nIn the Horn of Africa, scattered moderate to heavy rain continued and was observed over southern Ethiopia, Kenya, and southern Somalia, while limited and reduc d rain was registered over north-central Ethiopia. The continuation of wet conditions over the southern portions of Equatorial E stern Africa may ben fit ground conditions ov r many local areas. Howe r, oversaturation could also cause flooding and threaten the livelihoods of pe ple over some areas.\n\nDuring the next w ek, light to loc lly moderate rain is forecast over Ethiopia, which could help to partially reduce deficits over some local areas.

Mean maximum temperatures were 6-12°C above normal throughout large areas of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Meanwhile, far northwestern Kazakhstan experienced cooler than average conditions. 30°C maximum temperatures were recorded in Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. Maximum temperatures may be more than 12°C above normal in many central portions of the region next week, where an abnormal heat hazard is posted. 30°C highs may be occur as far north as southern Kazakhstan.\n\nPrecipitation Widespread moderate precipitation (10-50+mm liquid equivalent) was recorded across Kazakhstan during the last 7 days. Moderate and local heavy rain spread farther south across Afghanistan and Pakistan than the previous week. However, low snow water equivalent and large ninety-day precipitation deficits continue to persist over many portions of Central Asia. A drought hazard is posted over much of Afghanistan.\n\nDuring the next week, a swath of moderate precipitation is expected across Kazakhstan, while more significant precipitation (25-50+mm liquid equivalent) is forecast in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.\n\nNo hazards reported\n\nCentral America and the Caribbean Overview\n\nRain forecast signals start of Primera Season in Central America Scattered showers were received across parts of Guatemala and northern Honduras last week. Locally moderate weekly rainfall totals ranged from 10-50mm over the northern departments of Honduras, with little to no rainfall accumulations registered for many other interior departments in Central America. Despite the lack of rainfall during mid-March, several regions in Central America continue to register near-normal conditions towards the end of the Apante season. Remotely sensed vegetation health indices also indicate satisfactory ground conditions, with little evidence of degradation despite the seasonably dry conditions during February and March.\n\nTowards the end of March and early April, increased rainfall is expected which suggests the beginning of the Primera rainfall season in parts of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. The latest model guidance depicts the highest weekly rainfall accumulations over western Guatemala (>50mm), with lesser but well-distributed totals over many Pacific facing departments of Central America.\n\nRainfall forecast for southern Haiti during late March During the last week, isolated rain showers were recorded across parts of southern Haiti and eastern Dominican Republic. Rain gauge measurements indicate moderate weekly accumulations along the Dominican Republic coast with 31mm reported in Puerto Plata and 42mm reported in Santo Domingo. Lighter amounts (<10mm) were registered elsewhere throughout the country. Since late-February, rainfall continues to range between average to above-average, with light moisture surpluses concentrated over the eastern Dominican Republic and southern Haiti. Favorable ground conditions have also been observed over much of Hispaniola. During the next week, average to above-average rainfall is likely during late March and early April, with the highest amounts (>25mm) forecast over parts of southern Haiti and central Dominican Republic.\n\nABOUT WEATHER HAZARDS Hazard maps are based on current weather/climate information, short and medium range weather forecasts (up to 1 week) and their potential impact on crop and pasture conditions. Shaded polygons are added in areas where anomalous conditions have been observed. The boundaries of these polygons are only approximate at this continental scale.

Despite an above-average rainfall forecast last week, scattered showers were received across parts of Guatemala and northern Honduras. According to gauge reports, locally moderate weekly rainfall totals ranged from 10-50mm over the northern departments of Honduras, with little to no rainfall accumulations registered for many other interior departments in Central America. Despite the lack of rainfall during mid-March, several regions in Central America continue to register near-normal conditions towards the end of the Apante season. Analysis of seasonal moisture anomalies since last December suggest the performance of the Apante season has been generally favorable, with many regions experiencing average to above-average rainfall conditions due to periods of enhanced rainfall during January and early February. Remotely sensed vegetation health indices also indicate satisfactory ground conditions, with little evidence of degradation despite the seasonably dry conditions during February and March. Towards the end of March and arly April, increased precipit ion ctivity is climatologic lly xpected which suggests the beginning of the Primera rainfall season in parts of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. The latest model guidance depicts the highest weekly rainfall accumulations over western Guatemala (>50mm), with lesser but well-distributed totals over many Pacific facing departments of Central America.\n\nWeek 1 Rainfall Total Forecast and CMORPH climatology (mm) March 28 - April 4, 2018\n\nFigure 1: Source NOAA /
