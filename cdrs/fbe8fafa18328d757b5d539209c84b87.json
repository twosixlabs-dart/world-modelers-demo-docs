The findings will feed into the 2017 Humanitarian Requirements Documents (HRD), identifying the humanitarian requirements and response in 2017. The HRD is scheduled to be launched at the beginning of next year.\n\n To prepare the humanitarian community and inform donors in advance of the 2017 HRD, the clusters - coordinated by OCHA - have estimated next year's humanitarian needs based on available secondary information. The results of this exercise will be used to implement emergency response activities as of January 2017.\n\n The Food Cluster has estimated that 4.9 million people will be in need of food assistance next year. This figure include people affected by the new emerging drought in the southern belt of Ethiopia - particularly affecting southern Somali, southern parts of Oromia and SNNPR - and people in the highland not fully recovered from the El Niño drought.\n\n The October to December pastoral rainfall in southern pastoral areas in Oromia, SNNPR and dyer receiving zones in the Somali regions has failed to regenerate pasture and replenish water. After four weeks of delay, only scanty showers were received in a few areas. In addition to unusual livestock migration, there have been reports of livestock deaths in Oromia and Somali regions. As a result, food security has started to\n\nIn Numbers 9.7 million people in need of food assistance.\n\n7.1 million people targeted in the 2016 joint WFP -Government of Ethiopia response.\n\nUS$ 46 million is required for emergency relief, nutrition and PSNP for the December 2016 to May 2017 period.\n\nEthiopia: PRRO 200712-Humanitarian Relief Response\n\nFunding Update: WFP requirement Based on the 2016 mid-year review of the Humanitarian Requirements Documents, WFP needs an additional US$ 46 million for emergency relief (food assistance and cash transfer), nutrition and PSNP for the December 2016 to May 2017 period.\n\nLatest WFP publications\n\n Drought Emergency Relief Programme Update #15\n\n Drought Emergency Targeted Supplementary\n\nFeeding Programme Update (October 2016)\n\nDrought Emergency Dashboard November 2016\n\n WFP Wthiopia Drought Emergency Household Food\n\nSecurity Monitoring Bulletin #4\n\nHighlights  The Food Cluster has estimated that 4.9 million people in southern Somali, southern parts of Oromia, and SNNPR affected by the new emerging drought, and those in the highland not fully recovered from the El Niño drought will be in need of food assistance in 2017.\n\n To cover the gap between Round 9 and the bridging round in January 2017 in the Somali region, WFP is implementing an extra round of relief assistance to 1 million people affected by the new emerging drought in priority woredas.\n\nWFP ETHIOPIA Situation Report #14\n\n1-30 November 2016 W F P /M ic h a e l T e w e ld e deteriorate and is expected to worsen in the upcoming dry period between January and March. Water for human and livestock is a pressing need, particularly in birka and well dependent areas.\n\n The 2016 Meher season, the June to September rains, performed well in most parts of the country. The overall production outlook is favorable, while production will be below average in areas that experienced drier than normal conditions between July and midSeptember. These areas include lowlands of central Oromia, and some woredas in SNNPR. The current unseasonal frost and rain is harmful for crops in the field. The Meher harvests have already started across the country, and will bring down food insecurity levels in crop producing areas. The harvest is also contributing to seasonal price declines for some key cereals.\n\n Sitti zone in Somali region and most of Afar, specially the southern part will continue to face serious food shortages due to the reduced livestock herd size in the 2015/2016 droughts and because they are in the dry season now.\n\nWFP Response\n\nFood Assistance\n\n WFP has completed dispatching and distributing Round 9 in the Somali region. To ensure that the population in the areas affected by the new emerging drought receive food in December, the Prioritization Committee has approved WFP to implement an extra round of relief assistance to 1 million people in priority woredas in the region, before the bridging round in January 2017. JEOP and NDRMC will complete Round 9 in December.\n\n All three operators will implement a bridging round of relief assistance in January, based on the revised and estimated caseload of 4.9 beneficiaries.\n\nNutrition\n\n USAID and DFID hosted a Community\n\nManagement of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) Roundtable with UN partners, donors and selected Non-Governmental Organisations and Civil Society Organisations on 22 November. With the aim of formalising the way forward for Moderate Acute Malnutrition management, within the existing CMAM service delivery model, a three-pronged approach was proposed: i) Targeted Supplementary Feeding Programme (TSFP) integrated into routine CMAM services, ii) mobile TSFP services in pastoral areas, and iii) a scale-up of the first two approaches for emergency response.\n\n An additional 54 newly recruited TSFP surge capacity staff to Oromia region have been trained in TSFP implementation, monitoring, data collection and reporting. Thus far, at national level, 176 TSFP surge staff have been trained, and work to support the government with monitoring and reporting.\n\nLogistics\n\n With implementation of Mobile Storage Units\n\n(MSUs), local constructions, warehouse rentals, rehabilitation of storage facilities in more than 90 locations, the Logistics Cluster has augmented NDRMC and JEOPs storage capacity with 59,050 MT - or 100 percent of the target - as of 30 November 2016.\n\n To ensure NDRMC Dire Dawa has access to appropriate fleet transport capacity, WFP/ Logistics Cluster offered to support with additional WFP trucks. In addition, the NDRMC fleet compound in Dire Dawa will be rehabilitated by the Logistics Cluster, including the workshop and office facility.\n\n With the support from the Logistics Cluster\n\nFood Management Improvement Project has conducted the following activities (1) the recruitment process of 120 surge staff; (2) a training of surge staff who are seconded to NDRMC and deployed to Kombolcha, Nazareth and Dire Dawa hubs in warehouse management and; (3) the role of information management of weekly delivery and distribution updates in partnership with other WFP units.\n\nLogistics Cluster\n\n With the objective to build local capacity through knowledge sharing and skill transfer, 584 staff from NDRMC, Ethiopian Maritime Affairs Authority and Ethiopia Road Transport Authority, WFP and JEOP have been trained in warehouse management & best practises, TSFP and Relief activities, land transport, port operations and MSU maintenance in 21 locations.\n\n WFP has supported NDRMC hubs with staff augmentation and essential warehouse equipment. As a result, Adama hub has recorded a significant improvement in truck www.wfp.org/ethiopia\n\nDonors to the WFP Ethiopia Drought Emergency Response 2016\n\nAUSTRALIA CANADA\n\nECHO EGYPT IRELAND\n\nKING SALMAN\n\nHUMANITARIAN AID AND RELIEF CENTRE\n\nNORWAY\n\nSWITZERLAND UNA SWEDEN\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\n\nCHINA\n\nNETHERLANDS\n\nWFP ETHIOPIA DROUGHT EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nTotal requirement (US$) Jul 2015-Jun 2018\n\nTotal Received (US$) Jan 2016-Nov 2016\n\nFunding Gap (US$) Nov 2016-Apr 2017\n\nPeople Targeted 2016\n\nPRRO 200712 1 356 000 000 288 000 000 46 000 000\n\nEmergency Relief\n\nAssistance 7 100 000\n\nTargeted Supplementary\n\nFeeding Programme 2 360 000\n\nProductive Safety Net\n\nProgramme 1 600 000\n\nCZECH REPUBLIC\n\nETHIOPIA GERMANY\n\nRUSSIA\n\nUSA Listed alphabetically.
