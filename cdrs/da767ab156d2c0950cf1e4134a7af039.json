Primarily a result of failed Belg (spring harvest) and Meher (main harvest) rains in 2015, along with the onset of El Niño, over 10.2 million people required emergency food and nutrition assistance. The 2016 drought impacted severely the North-Eastern areas: Afar and the northern Somali region, central and eastern Oromia, eastern Amhara and southern and central Tigray region.\n\nToday, residual effects of the drought in the northern highlands and central parts of Ethiopia are coupled by the onset of a new drought. The 2017 drought is currently impacting the Southern and Southern-East part of the country, together with areas of the SNNPR. Adding to the in-country concerns is the ever-increasing number of refugees fleeing both drought and insecurity from South Sudan, Somalia, and Eritrea.\n\nWFP has analysed the 2015-2016 drought's impact on food security through household food security monitoring in six drought-affected regions. The main indicators considered were Food Consumption Score (FCS), food expenditure share, Dietary Diversity Score (DDS), Purchasing Power (PP) and Coping Strategies Index (CSI). The exercise found out that, whilst food consumption and dietary diversity stabilized throughout the 2015-2016, there was a decline in purchasing power and an increased deployment of negative coping strategies.\n\nPurchasing power decreased in the drought-affected highland areas, where the expected Meher harvest was reduced by 50% to 90% (2016 HRD). Livestock losses increased dramatically, leading to a decrease in farmer's incomes up to 60%, compared to the previous year.\n\nNegative coping strategies, such as reducing meal size, skipping meals, borrowing food, selling assets, declined during the year. However, endemic poverty, and the sheer magnitude of the drought's impact, meant that some households still resorted to negative coping strategies aforementioned, particularly in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region (SNNPR).\n\nThe overall food consumption across the country improved by 24% in 2016, compared to 2015 due to successful Kiremt rains between June and September, together with the assistance provided by the GoE and humanitarian partners. However, inadequate food consumption remained high in SNNPR\n\nIn Numbers 5.6 million people in need of relief assistance. 4.7 million are targeted in the joint WFPGovernment of Ethiopia (GoE) response, with the balance assisted by the NGO consortium Joint Emergency Operations Programme (JEOP)\n\n2.7 million moderately acute malnourished children under five and pregnant and breastfeeding women in need of specialised nutritious food, of which WFP will assist 1.3 million in Priority 1 woredas.\n\nUSD 436 million requirement from March to December 2017 for Relief, TSF, PSNP and Refugee activities.\n\nPhoto: General Food Distribution in the Somali Region. WFP/Michael Tewelde\n\nHighlights  Insecurities at the Oromia-Somali border delayed dispatch and deliveries of food to the Somali Region in February 2017.\n\n In the Somali Region, WFP supported 1.3 million people in Round 1 Relief assistance, and will meet the needs of 1.7 million in Round 2. Currently, WFP does not have the resources to cover 1.7 million people until the end of the year. Unless resources are made available, WFP will face shortfall in the Round 3.\n\n Of the 5.6 million 2017 HRD beneficiaries, 2.03 million are affected by the ongoing Horn of Africa drought. WFP is supporting 1.3 million with Relief assistance and 407,398 with Targeted Supplementary Feeding.\n\nJanuary and February 2017\n\nWFP Ethiopia 2017 Emergency Situation Report #1\n\nPage | 2 2017 WFP Ethiopia Emergency Situation Report #1 www.wfp.org/ethiopia\n\nTrend analysis shows a decline in the proportion of households with low dietary diversity from an average of 84% in February 2016 to an average of 30% in November 2016. Following the good harvest the proportion of households with medium to high dietary diversity improved throughout 2016, increasing from 16% to 70%\n\nWhile the food security condition improved in the highland affected by the El Niño drought, below normal Gu rains (April-June) in the southern part of Ethiopia, particularly in the Somali Region (except Sitti and Fafan zones) deteriorated food security and pastoral conditions. By October 2016 the prolonged dry Hagaa season (July-September) and subsequently delayed Deyr rains (SeptemberDecember) led to critical water shortage across the seven Somali regions (today Horn of Africa drought affected), increased malnutrition rates, sharp increase in market prices and livestock mortality and migration to Oromia.\n\nIn November 2016, there were clear evidences of a new emerging drought in the southern parts of Oromia and SNNP regions and most part of the Somali Region, with increasing MAM and SAM rates, reduction of meals, drought induced school drop outs. In some woredas goat prices decreased by 31% and sugar and wheat prices increased by 20% compared to the previous month.\n\nIn addition to the current 2017 drought, which covers the southern belt of Ethiopia and spreads across the Horn of Africa, the 2015/2016 drought has left a backlash of residual needs - especially in highland areas of Ethiopia. Areas such as East and West Hararghe in Oromia Region, Wag Himra and North and South Wollo, and large swathes of Afar still remain priority in 2017.\n\nWFP Emergency response 2017\n\nThe 2017 response will have to support the unique needs of pastoralist communities who have lost a significant number of livestock-their main source of income. Emergency response activities will focus on southern part of Ethiopia where the Horn of Africa (HoA) drought is having devastating effects. At the same time, there are residual needs from 2016 in some highland areas of Ethiopia (East and West Hararghe, North and South Wollo, Wag Himra, and Afar), and will continue to need assistance in 2017.\n\nThe Government of Ethiopia (GoE) has launched the Humanitarian Requirement Document (HRD) for 2017, outlining the need to support 5.6 million people with emergency food, nutrition, health, water and education programmes.\n\nOf the 5.6 million, WFP and the National Disaster Risk Management Commission (NDRMC) will cover 4.7 million while the Joint Emergency Operation (JEOP) will be responsible for the balance. While JEOP has the required funding to meet the needs of 900,000 people, funding shortfalls for the WFP- GoE pipeline warrant concern.\n\nSome 2.7 million children and women have been targeted under the 2017 HRD for treatment of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) in Nutrition Hotspot Priority 1, 2, and 3 woredas. WFP will support 1.3 million children and women living in Priority 1 Hotspot woredas. Current resources will ensure coverage for the 1.3 million children and women until June, but an additional USD 22.8 million is required to ensure continuity of programming in the second half of 2017.\n\nWFP is providing food and cash assistance to refugees in 27 camps across the country. Since November 2015, WFP together with Administration for Refugees and Returnee Affairs and UNHCR, has implemented biometric verification in five out of six regions planned. Currently, this has reduced the actual beneficiary figure by 12%, which consequently has reduced the funding requirements for the operation from USD 11 million to USD 8.75 million per month. From now and until the end of 2017, WFP plans to respond to 650,000 refugees, including an assumed total of 50,000 new arrivals from South Sudan an Somalia.\n\nRelief assistance In 2017, the Somali Region has identified some 1.7 million people in need of emergency food assistance. Since January 2017, WFP supported 1.3 million people during Round 1 of HRD transfers and is now meeting the needs of the 1.7 million people in the region as part of Round 2. Unless further resources are made available, WFP will not be able meet the needs of 1.7 million people in the coming rounds. Anticipating this reality, WFP is already working with the Regional Government on scenarios for providing assistance at reduced rations until new contributions materialise.\n\nPage | 3 2017 WFP Ethiopia Emergency Situation Report #1 www.wfp.org/ethiopia\n\n166,867 HRD beneficiaries Oromia in areas where markets have adequate supplies of food items from the 2016 Meher harvest. A total of USD 3.2 million will be transferred to these beneficaires (USD 6.74 per beneficiary) over the course of Round 2 and 3 of the 2017 HRD relief assistance effort.\n\nIn February 2017, notwithstanding delays in dispatches of food due to the insecurity at the OromiaSomali border, WFP completed deliveries of relief food to 77% of the Food Delivery Points (FDPs) in the Somali Region between week 2 and 3 of Round 1, meeting the target of completing 70% or more of the FDPs within four weeks. 62% of FDPs had completed distributions at week 4.\n\nNDRMC has dispatched 50% of the 52,102 mt food allocated to 2,988,729 beneficiaries in Round 1. Due to delays in allocations to Oromia, only 1% of the food has been distributed to 21,339 beneficiaries in Oromia as of 23 February 2017.\n\nTargeted Supplementary Feeding Programme In 2017, WFP will be covering 1.3 million HRD MAM cases in 192 Priority 1 woredas and some Priority 2 second generation with Target Supplementary Feeding commodities. Of the total WFP caseload 211,645 children under five year and 195,753 PLW live in 85 woredas affected by the Horn of Africa drought.\n\nIn January 2017, WFP assisted 68% of the planned 271,063 MAM beneficiaries. In February 2017, WFP assisted the needs of 64% of the planned 544,183 MAM beneficiaries. In March 2017, WFP plan to assist 442,284 MAM beneficiaries. WFP did not reach the planned number of beneficiaries in January and February, due to delays in transportation of specialised nutritious foods by the regional DPPB, and lack of timely and appropriate screening data for the newly identified hotspot priority one woredas.\n\nThe ongoing drought in the HoA drought is affecting areas of Oromia, SNNP and Somali regions and has displaced a high number of pastoralists. WFP, in collaboration with partners, will try to address the needs of the internally displaced.\n\nIn the Somali Region, in order to address the needs of the affected population WFP is opting for a differentiated implementation through partnering with NGOs; integrating MAM management through static and functional health facilities; strengthening the Mobile Health and Nutrition Teams (MHNT); and through the regular DPPB delivery mechanisms based on the screening conducted by Regional Health Bureau.\n\nRefugee\n\nThe refugee operation is currently seeing an influx of new arrivals from South Sudan and Somalia, caused by food insecurity and ongoing conflict.\n\nIn January 2017, the new arrival rate from Somalia was around 120 people a day, with high rates of GAM (78%) for children and PLW. To respond to this increase, WFP is distributing high energy biscuits (HEB) to new arrivals. The new arrivals from Somalia are transferred to WFP's refugee camps in Dollo Ado, in the Somali regions, where they are entitled to general food distributions (GFD). MSF Spain established a health post next to WFP's reception centre for emergency treatments. As of 24 February 2017, no mortalities have been reported amongst the new arrivals.\n\nIn January 2017, WFP distributed food to 550,991 refugees, reaching 93% of the planned figures. For February 2017, the planned figure is 582,583 beneficiaries (incorporating a number of new arrivals). Actual distribution figures are expected from ARRA in a few weeks. In March 2017, WFP is planning to assist 568,111, of which 159,692 refugees are in the five camps in Dollo Ado, Somali Region, absorbing the majority of the Somali refugee influx.\n\nActivities to build resilience 2017\n\nCrop and livestock insurances\n\nThe R4 Rural Resilience Initiative (R4) is a comprehensive risk management approach to help communities be more resilient to climate shocks. In 2016, 29,024 beneficiaries in 81 villages in Tigray Page | 4 2017 WFP Ethiopia Emergency Situation Report #1 www.wfp.org/ethiopia total population insured.\n\nWFP is developing a Pasture-Drought Satellite Index Insurance for pastoralists. The project aims to enhance the resilience of pastoralists and agro-pastoralists by responding right at the beginning of a drought through timely pay-outs that enable pastoralists to purchase supplementary livestock feed and veterinary treatments. Similarly to R4, beneficiaries will be insured in return for participation in public works for climate change adaptation and mitigation. WFP aims to pilot the project in three woredas in the Somali region, starting in September 2017.\n\nHIV\n\nPeople living with HIV (PLHIV) have higher calorie requirements compared to the rest of the population and this makes them particularly vulnerable to malnutrition in emergencies. WFP works to improve nutritional status, health and food security of malnourished PLHIV, PLW living with HIV and Orphans and vulnerable children (OVC).\n\nIn 2016, WFP supported 41,720 beneficiaries in 89 woredas with cash & vouchers. To monitor the food security status of PLHIV, WFP carries out a biannual food consumption survey at household level. The 2016 survey found that male-headed households with poor food consumption scores have increased from 4.6% in 2015 to 6% in 2016. WFP, together with its partners, is investigating the root causes of this finding.\n\nIn 2016, the nutrition recovery rate for PLHIV with MAM enrolled in food assistance was 85%, 10% higher than the initial 75% target. The mortality rate was 0%, well below the original rate of 3%.\n\nThe 2016 drought has led PLHIV in the Somali and Afar Regions to drop out of treatment both for HIV and for malnutrition, in search of food for their households and grazing lands for their animals. In 2017, the risk of PLHIV discontinuing their treatment is very high. WFP is supporting 8,590 HIV MAM beneficiaries in drought affected woredas in Oromia, SNNP and Somali regions, and 731 HIV SAM beneficiaries in the Somali Region.\n\nWFP is providing SNFs through a Nutrition Assessment Counseling and Support (NACS) intervention for PLHIV with SAM. To encourage PLHIV beneficiaries not to drop out of treatment, WFP provides food vouchers or cash, whilst health institutions provide relief assistance. Currently, due to limited resources, WFP can only provide cash to one household member.\n\nLogistics Support\n\nEthiopia Logistics Cluster\n\nThe Ethiopia Logistics Cluster (ELC) was activated in March 2016, and contributed to operations as follows:\n\nAs of 10 February 2017, storage capacity has now reached 66,000 mt (110% of the initial target) through the implementation of different storage solutions in more than 90 locations.\n\nFood dispatches from the Adama NDRMC hub have improved as a result of staffing augmentation, warehousing equipment and supply chain management support. The truck turn round time has been cut from 5 days (June 2016) to less than 48 hours (February 2017). Maximum loading capacity per day improved from 1,300 mt in June 2016 to 2,500 mt in February 2017.\n\nA ELC coordination meeting took place on 22 February with other humanitarian organisations in Jijiga (Somali Region) to assess logistics gaps and needs in HoA affected woredas. Transportation of water tanks, and storage of NFIs, were outlined as main priorities.\n\nConsidering the increased needs in the Somali region, ELC staff have been deployed to support logistics operations.\n\nPage | 5 2017 WFP Ethiopia Emergency Situation Report #1 www.wfp.org/ethiopia The ELC is pushing ahead to complete the planned storage augmentation in Somali region. Storage capacity has reached 4,400 mt, through Mobile Storage Units (MSUs) and local constructions, in eleven locations. Six additional local constructions are expected to be completed in the coming weeks.\n\nThe ELC has supported UNHAS Ethiopia in the installation of a new terminal in Dolo. A MSU of 104 m2 has been installed to facilitate air operations, as well as access for humanitarian staff and deliveries of urgent humanitarian supplies to the drought affected area.\n\nLogistics Operations\n\nSeveral delays were experienced in dispatches to Somali region, as a result of insecurity at the Somali-Oromia border.\n\nWFP Shipping going to ensure priority berthing for WFP vessel in Djibouti. Within the first half of March 2017 the following vessels are expected to arrive in Djibouti with cargo destined to Ethiopia:\n\n MV Mariana with 46.082 mt NPS (GoE)  MV Feliz n with 49.000 mt urea (GoE)  MV Thorco glory with 10.000 mt wheat (WFP)  MV Karteria with 25,000 mt wheat (USAID/CRS)\n\n MV Liberty eagle with 40.250 mt wheat (USAID/CRS)\n\nCapacity building\n\nBuilding on the lessons learned from the 2015-2016 drought emergency response, and on the work conducted by the ELC, WFP proposes to provide technical assistance to the GoE with the following capacity building interventions:\n\n Augmentation of National Humanitarian Emergency Logistics Preparedness in Ethiopia, through the establishment of humanitarian staging areas (HAS) in the key NDRMC logistics hubs of Dire Dawa, Kombolcha and Adama, together with emergency preparedness trainings for government and organ-isation responders.\n\n Capacity strengthening support to the Ethiopian Maritime Affairs Authority (EMAA), to reduce port congestion and improve planning, forecasting of incoming cargo and joint commodity procurement amongst importers.\n\n WFP, in close cooperation with Federal Road Transport Authority (RTA), is developing a project to strengthen the commercial road transport sector. The project is based on WFP's best-practice in fleet management, including advanced and tailor-made fleet management systems, and will be complemented with training programmes for Ethiopia's commercial road.\n\nResourcing and requirements\n\nPipeline Long term operational planning is challenged by lack of visibility in the GoE's pipeline.\n\nBased on available information, NDRMC is likely to face shortfall in pulses and vegetable oil from Round 3.\n\nThe increased number of beneficiaries in the Somali Region, from 1.3 to 1.7 million, will result in cereal shortfalls due in Round 3.\n\nConfirmed contributions:\n\nConfirmed contribution from Russia (USD 1.5 million), OCHA (USD 208,114), Japan (USD 2.2 million), USAID (USD 27.6) and Government of Ethiopia (USD 390,662), CERF Rapid Response (USD 5\n\nPage | 6 2017 WFP Ethiopia Emergency Situation Report #1 www.wfp.org/ethiopia\n\nActivity and operator\n\nBeneficiary caseload\n\nTotal funding requirement\n\n(in USD)\n\nNet Shortfall Mar-Dec 2017\n\nIn USD In mt Relief WFP + GoE 4.7 m 602.2 m 353 m 103,222\n\nTSFP 1.3 m 52.3 m 22.8 m 16,556\n\nPSNP 0.6 m 27.1 m 7.2 m 10,274\n\nRefugee 0.6 m 99 m 53 m 48,904\n\nDonors 2017\n\nCERF, China, Denmark, Ethiopia, Germany, Japan, King Salman Humanitarian Centre, MAF Advanced, OCHA, Russia, SARC, USAID Listed alphabetically.
