Please contact us at info@acaps.org 1\n\nPURPOSE AND SCOPE\n\nThis report provides baseline, background, and context information on the Tigray region, referring to the situation before the beginning of the conflict that erupted in November 2020. It was compiled to help inform the humanitarian response.\n\nOVERVIEW Population: Tigray has an estimated population of nearly 5.7 million people (5.5% of the total population of Ethiopia), predominantly rural, although recent years have seen rapid urbanisation. Tigrayans constitute the majority ethnic group. Half of the population is under 18 years old. In October 2020, Tigray was hosting over 100,000 IDPs, primarily from Amhara and Oromia regions, and over 5,500 returnee IDPs, as well as more than 95,000 refugees, predominantly from Eritrea, mostly hosted in four camps.\n\nPolitics & economy: The Tigrayan political elites have played a dominant role in Ethiopia's politics since 1994. This is partly responsible for significant economic growth in the region, with relatively high levels of investment and strong local government capacity. However, Tigray continues to have the highest poverty rate in the country.\n\nHumanitarian concerns: Tigray's economy and livelihoods, centred around agriculture, are highly dependent on rainfall, with some parts of Tigray experiencing only one rainy season per year. A decrease in rainfall and increase in the occurrence of droughts due to climate change has had a significant impact on livelihoods and food security in the region. Desert locusts are an additional hazard, with a desert locust infestation in 2019/20 leading to high losses, especially in eastern Tigray. Food insecurity in Tigray is significant, with over 82,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and 346,000 in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) in October 2020, projected to deteriorate even before the outbreak of violence. Poor WASH conditions are a key driver of malnutrition. Access to health services is difficult in remote areas.\n\nProtection concerns: There is a high prevalence of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) in Tigray. One in four women has experienced female genital mutilation/circumcision (FGM/C), and many women have married under the age of 18. Female literacy rates are lower than male rates. Child labour is common. Among Eritrean refugees, a high number of female heads of household and unaccompanied children implies protection needs.\n\nCOVID-19: More than 6,300 cases of COVID-19 had been registered in Tigray until October 2020, although significant underreporting is likely. Containment measures have had a significant socioeconomic impact in the region.\n\nAccess and infrastructure: Road infrastructure in Tigray is generally good, though road access is limited in remote rural areas. Road access is also difficult in mountainous areas, with dirt roads becoming impassable during rainy seasons.\n\nMETHODOLOGY AND LIMITATIONS This report is largely based on secondary data review of publicly available information. Additional non-public sources were consulted. See page 4 for information gaps on Tigray.\n\nETHIOPIA\n\nThe Pre-crisis situation in Tigray\n\nSource: UNOCHA 25/01/2021\n\nThis report benefited from support by the H2H Network's H2H Fund, which is supported by UK aid from the UK government\n\nINFORMATION GAPS\n\nA number of information gaps for Tigray Region were identified:\n\n• Information on community perceptions of need, the impact of rumours and misconceptons, as well as disseminated information\n\n• Reliable data on crime in the region, such as homicide rates\n\n• Data on pensions\n\n• Recent and regional information on critical infrastructure\n\n• Information about people with disabilities\n\n• Information about bank accounts in Tigray\n\n• Information on length of road network\n\nIssues with data recency or clarity were also present:\n\nThe most recent census data available is from 2007. Data is supplemented with more recent estimates and surveys wherever possible.\n\nThe Demographic and Health Survey 2016 is representative at the national level. It is not clear whether it is representative at regional level.\n\nPRE-EXISTING CONTEXT IN TIGRAY\n\nDemography\n\nTigray is located in the northern most part of Ethiopia, bordering Amhara to the south, Afar to the east, Sudan to the west and Eritrea to the north. The total size of Tigray is 50,079 Km2 (CSA 07/2017), representing approximately 4.4% of Ethiopia's land mass.\n\nPopulation The last census conducted in Ethiopia was in 2007. According to this census the total population of Tigray was 4,314,456, equivalent to 5.8% of the country's population (FDRE 12/2008). The 2019 population of Tigray was estimated at 5,443,000 (UNICEF 12/2019A, based on FDRE 12/2008). The 2021 population is estimated at 5,685,598 (OCHA, accessed 03/02/2021). The average household size in Tigray is 4.2 people (CSA 12/2020). Urbanisation is increasing. According to estimates for 2021, 30% of Tigray's population lives in urban areas, up from 19.5% in the 2007 census (OCHA, accessed 03/02/2021; FDRE 12/2008). Please see Table 7 population estimates by zone - gender and rural/urban in the Annex for more details.\n\nAdministrative organisation Tigray is one of ten regions in Ethiopia. It is further divided into seven zones, including the capital Mekele. The zones are divided into 88 woredas (districts) and towns. Woredas are further divided into sub-districts called tabias, also referred to as kebeles (FDRE 12/2008; UNICEF 12/2019; OCHA, accessed 03/02/2021). The Amhara-Tigray boundary has been the subject of considerable dispute in recent years, and with Amharan authorities now playing an administrative role in parts of the Tigrayan territory (particularly in the Western, North Western and Southern zones), there may be changes in the future (ICG 6/2020, KII 02/2021).\n\nSource: OCHA 17/08/2017; OCHA, accessed 03/02/2021\n\nSex and age disaggregation For 2021, 49.3% of the population in Tigray was estimated to be male and 50.7% was estimated to be female. 13% of the population were estimated to be under 5, and 50% under 18 (OCHA, accessed 03/02/2021). Please see Table 8 - 2021 population estimates by zone - age in the annex for more details by zone.\n\nEthnicities and minorities According to 2007 census data, Tigrayans are the predominant ethnic group (96.6% of the population). There are over 80 ethnic minority groups, the largest being Amhara (1.6%) and Irob (0.7%). Eritreans are the most significant non-Ethiopian nationality present in Tigray (FDRE 12/2008). Please see Table 9 - Largest ethnic groups in Tigray in the annex for more detailed information.\n\nPeople on the move\n\nTigray is one of the regions in Ethiopia most affected by population movements, especially the Eastern zone (EUTF 2019). Tigray hosts migrants, refugees, IDPs as well as returnees (IDPs and migrants) (ILO 08/2020).\n\nPre-crisis IDPs: As at October 2020, there were 100,581 IDPs identified in Tigray by IOM DTM (IOM DTM 30/11/2020). The vast majority of IDPs in Tigray were displaced between 2016 and 2019 (93,641 people) from Amhara and Oromia, and conflict is the primary cause of displacement (OCHA 05/2019).. 5,677 identified IDPs) were displaced in 2019 and 1,263 IDPs as at September 2020. In 2020, the highest number of IDPs was identified in Mekele (28%) followed by Eastern Tigray (20%). Tigray hosts 5.4% of the total IDP population in Ethiopia, which, based on site assessments in August and September, totalled 1,846,551 IDPs across the country (IOM DTM 30/11/2020). The table inserted in the map below shows IDPs identified by zone as of September 2020.\n\nPre-crisis refugees: As at 4 November 2020, there were 95,929 refugees and asylum seekers in Tigray of whom 99.9% (95,916) were from Eritrea (UNHCR 20/10/2020). This means that Tigray hosted 54% of the total Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia (178,315) (UNHCR 20/11/2020).\n\nAmong the total number of Eritrean refugees in Tigray, 91.5% (88,035 refugees) were hosted in four Eritrean refugee camps located in North Western Zone (Adi Harush, Mai-Aini, Hitsats and Shimelba) while there was an out-of-camp population of 7,818 people living in 25 towns in Tigray hosting refugees (UNHCR 14/12/2020). The breakdown of the population figures per location (inserted in the map above), leaves 295 individuals unaccounted for that are included in the total refugee figure reported by UNHCR. Refugee figures are based on a biometric registration exercise in 2018/19 (UNHCR 20/11/2021). Movements into the camps from Eritrea, from Tigray to other parts of the country and from Ethiopia through onward migration routes likely have occurred since then. The precise number of people living in the camps in October 2020 will therefore need to be triangulated with subsequent registration and food distribution processes. Out-of-camp refugees are formally registered through the Out of Camp Policy (OCP) but figures do not necessarily reflect refugees who left camps without notification and refugees living in informal settlement who crossed the border without registration (ODI 11/2020, DIIS 06/11/2021).\n\n62% of Eritrean refugees in Tigray were over the age of 18, while 28% were children under the age of 18 (UNHCR 14/12/2020).\n\nThe current displacement of Eritrean refugees into Ethiopia started in August 2000. Drivers of displacement included forced conscription, detention without trial, persecution, compulsory land acquisition by the state, arbitrary arrest, human rights violations, political oppression, and poverty (ODI 2020). Eritrean refugees are an ethnically diverse refugee group resulting in camp-specific population profiles. Kunama refugees are a particular group and were among the first refugees to flee to Ethiopia fearing retaliations of the Eritrean government (ODI 2020; RI 18/02/2004). Refugees arriving from Eritrea following the 1998-2000 war were transferred to Shimelba camp in 2004. In 2020, Shimelba camp continued to host a large part of the initial Kunama refugee population as well as initial Tigrinya-speaking refugees; many of them have lived in the camp for over a decade (ODI 2020). During mid-2018, the Eritrea-Ethiopia border was opened for refugees, leading to an increase in arrivals of women and children. Pre-2018 refugees from Ethiopia to Tigray had been mainly young men (ODI 2020).\n\nPre-crisis returnees: As at October 2020 5,565 IDP returnees were identified in Tigray. Since 2017, 30% of all returning Ethiopian migrants have originated from Tigray resulting in high numbers of returnees resettling in Tigray, but there is a lack of recent data on how many migrant returnees lived in Tigray pre-crisis (IOM 18/12/2020).\n\nInternal and cross-border migration: In 2016, 43.5% of migration movements in Tigray took place within the region, 26% migrated to another region within Ethiopia and another 30.5% of migrants crossed the border into a different country (UNICEF 12/2019A). The migrants who leave for another region or country are mainly Tigray migrants from urban areas, although rural-to urban migration takes place as well. The main reasons for migration are lack of work opportunities and the hope for a better life (UNICEF 12/2019A). Lack of land for farming is another major reason for youth from Tigray, especially rural Tigray, to migrate to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Dubai and other countries (AFDB 2017). Tigray also hosts migrants from Eritrea, but no recent figures exist. In border zones, local authorities allow them to establish business without the need for special permits which has led to local integration of migrants (EUTF 2019). Tigray is in close proximity to one of the three migration routes of eastern Africa, from Sudan to Libya (UNHCR 04/2019). Of importance is especially the Sudan-Ethiopia border crossing at Metema, Amhara, which commonly serves as a launchpad for migration, and is used by Eritrean refugees from Tigray as well as by Ethiopians from Tigray and other parts of the country (Southworld 01/07/2019; Research and Evidence Facility 03/2020).\n\nManagement of IDPs and refugees: For IDP related humanitarian response operations and coordination, national and regional offices of the National Disaster Risk Management Commission (NDRMC) are responsible for guiding under the 2013 National Policy and Strategy on Disaster Risk Management, working closely with regional authorities. The national agency mandated to lead on refugee programmes is the Federal Agency for Refugee and Returnee Affairs (ARRA) which administers camps directly in the region, while UNHCR and partners provide education, health, and other services (ILO 08/2020).\n\nSociety\n\nLanguages The main language of Tigray region is Tigrinya. According to the 2007 census, this is spoken by 95% of the population across the region (FDRE accessed 3/2/2021). The remaining population have the following as their main language: Amharic (3.1%), Saho (0.7%), Afar (0.3%), Qimant (0.3%), Aari (0.1%), Kunama (0.1%), Oromo (0.1%), and other (0.3%) (TWB accessed 5/2/2021). A breakdown of languages spoken by zone can be found in Table 10 - Languages spoken within Tigray by zone.\n\nReligion Tigray Region is predominantly Orthodox Christian (92.2%), with a minority Muslim, Catholic, and a very limited number of Protestants. Tigray is the region with the largest proportion of Orthodox Christians (CSA 12/2020). Please see Table 11 - Religion in Tigray and Ethiopia in the annex for more details.\n\nSocietal roles / inclusion\n\nGender: Ethiopia's constitution clearly stipulates women's rights, and the Women's Policy of Ethiopia confirms the Government's commitment to gender equality (UN Women accessed 8/2/2021). Women gained the right to vote in Ethiopia in 1955 (Womens suffrage accessed 5/2/2021). In 2020, 39% of seats in national parliament were occupied by women (WB accessed 8/2/2021), an increase from only 3% in 1991 (IPS News 10/4/2020). The 2020 Global Gender Gap Report ranks Ethiopia at 82 out of 153 countries, and Ethiopia was among the top five most improved countries in the world (WEF 2020). Despite this, girls and women are at a strong disadvantage compared to boys and men in Ethiopia, particularly in the areas of literacy, health, livelihoods, and basic human rights. Women have low status in society and there are inadequate social support networks (UN Women accessed 8/2/2021).\n\nIn Tigray, only five out of ten women are literate, compared to seven out of ten men (CSA 12/2020). Women marry on average 6.6 years earlier than men (UNICEF 12/2019A; CSA 07/2017). Women have less exposure to media than men, for instance only 15% of women in Tigray compared to 35% of men listened to the radio (Alive&Thrive 2018).\n\nTable 12 - Gender indicators for Tigray and Ethiopia in the annex presents the key gender indicators for Tigray compared to national averages.\n\nWhen comparing Tigray to the national averages for Ethiopia, Tigray presents stronger gender inclusion for some indicators, and lower for others. When it comes to education indicators, Tigrayan women present higher literacy rates, and a higher percentage have obtained secondary education and beyond, compared to national averages. However, Tigrayan women are likely to marry earlier and have more children than the national average. Female unemployment rates were also higher for Tigrayan women. In terms of protection concerns, less women in Tigray have experienced violence from a husband or a partner compared to national averages. Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is practiced on approximately one in four women in Tigray, compared to nearly two out of every three women at a national level (UNICEF 12/2019A). Please see Protection Concerns for more information about FGM and other issues related to gender in Tigray.\n\nDisabilities: In 2015/16, 9.3% of Ethiopia's population were estimated to live with some form of disability (UNICEF12/2019D), It was not possible to obtain regional numbers for Tigray. Please see Table 13 - Overview of enrolment of students with disabilities for more information about schooling for children with disabilities in Tigray.\n\nLGBTQ+: Consensual sex between same-sex couples is unlawful and homosexual acts are considered an offense across Ethiopia under Proclamation No. 414/2004, with penalties including \"simple imprisonment\" from 10 days to three years (Pride Legal accessed 8/2/2021; ILGA 05/2010). A maximum sentence of 10 years can be imposed if there is use of \"violence, intimidation or coercion, trickery or fraud, or takes unfair advantage of the victim's inability to offer resistance\". Same-sex marriage is illegal and same-sex couples cannot adopt a child (Equaldex accessed 08/02/2021).\n\nPolitics\n\nPolitical history of Tigray\n\nPre-1991: Tigray is a minority part of the highland zone that has been the dominant force in Ethiopia's modern history. The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) was formed in 1975 in opposition to the Derg government that deposed Emperor Haile Selassie in the country a year earlier. Having fought a war in alliance with other non-state armed groups (NSAGs) in the country, including the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), they ultimately played a leading role in the downfall of the Derg in 1991.\n\nThe Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) Government 1991-2018:\n\nThe chairman of the TPLF, Meles Zenawi, became the Prime Minister of Ethiopia in 1991 leading a multi-ethnic coalition, the EPRDF. Although made up of four ethnically different political parties, Tigray People's Liberation Front, Amhara Democratic Party, Oromo Democratic Party, and the Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement, the TPLF was the dominant political force throughout this period. In the late 1990s, Ethiopia fought a war against the newly independent Eritrean government over the new international border, a war that killed tens of thousands and created hostile relations between the political elites in Mekele and Asmara (ICG 15/06/2016; ICG 04/09/2009).\n\nDomestically, the EPRDF oversaw a period of both significant economic growth and poverty reduction across the country under Zenawi's developmental state ideology. They also reshaped the Ethiopian state, creating a federal structure organised around ethno-linguistic regions. As part of this process, the boundaries of Tigray region grew to incorporate territories to both the west and south. This expansion created significant grievances within the Amhara region (ICG 12/06/2020). While investment and international aid grew significantly, internal opposition was suppressed increasingly violently, particularly after the 2005 elections which saw the EPRDF lose significant numbers of votes. Concerns over corruption and the capture of state resources by the TPLF also grew, particularly as ethnic Tigrayans came to dominate many of the key governmental institutions (ICG 04/09/2009).\n\nAfter the death of Meles Zenawi in 2012, the TPLF's dominance of the political space began to weaken significantly, with rising public protests in both the Oromia and Amhara regions led by youth groups complaining about a lack of opportunity and the dominance of the central state. Despite attempts to suppress these protests by the federal government, they continued to grow, in parallel with re-alignments among the political elites. An informal political alliance between Amharan and Oromian elites led to the selection of Abiy Ahmed as the new chairman of the EPRDF and Prime Minister of Ethiopia in early 2018 (ICG 16/12/2019)\n\n2018-2020: Between 2018 and 2020 tensions between the Federal government and the TPLF grew steadily. The new Prime Minister was keen to demonstrate a break from the past, and has overseen a significant reduction in the number of senior Tigrayan officials in both civilian and military government agencies. One of his first acts as Prime Minister was the signing of a peace agreement with the Eritrean government on 9 July 2018, a process from which the TPLF felt excluded (ICG 16/12/2019; ISS 11/11/2020; UN 10/07/2018). The TPLF elite largely withdrew to Mekele, and when the Prime Minister disbanded the EPRDF in late 2019 to create a new, more centralised Prosperity Party, refused to be part of the process (ICG 11/02/2021)\n\nTensions escalated further around the national elections originally scheduled for May 2020. The Federal government postponed, citing COVID-19 concerns, a move that the TPLF immediately condemned as one of political expediency. The TPLF vowed to push ahead with regional elections, which were held in Tigray on 9 September 2020 against the wishes of the federal government, who argued that they were unconstitutional. These elections were reported to have been won by TPLF by more than 98% of approximately 2.7 million votes (Addis Standard 11/09/2020).\n\nPre-existing territorial disputes\n\nEthiopia and Sudan both lay claim to territory along the border with Amhara, called Fashqa/ Al-Fashaga. In 2008, an agreement on establishing a \"soft border\" was reached; however, with the change of government in Ethiopia in 2018, political tensions increased again, with an increasing potential for violence in the border area (DW 19/01/2021; Al Jazeera 01/02/2021)\n\nSince Eritrea's independence in 1993 there have been disputes around the new international border between Ethiopia and Eritrea, escalating into violent armed conflict between 1998 and 2000, partly over a strip of land around the border town of Badme and leading to ongoing tensions between political elites in Mekele and Asmara. The peace agreement signed in 2000 was not fully implemented until Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's appointment in 2018. (Foreign Policy 12/07/2018; BBC 28/12/2020; ISS 11/09/2020).\n\nThere have been considerable tensions around the border between Ethiopia's Amhara and Tigray regions since the establishment of the current federal arrangement under the EPRDF. These tensions have particularly manifested around western and southern parts of the current Tigray region, which Amharan activists - and many politicians - argue should never have been part of the Tigray region. In recent years this has led to clashes and security incidents along the border between the two regions, and restrictions of movement (ICG 12/06/2020). In late 2019, military checkpoints were set up along the road connecting Mekele with Humera (OCHA 08/01/2020).\n\nGovernment\n\nNational: Since 1995, Ethiopia's political system has been defined as a federal democratic republic made up of ten regional states. Additionally, there are two administrative city states: Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa. Within this system there are two federal houses: the House of Federation, whose members are chosen by the state assemblies, and a House of People's Representatives, who are chosen through direct election (Ethiopar accessed 09/02/2021). At the federal level, the highest judicial powers are with the Federal Supreme Court (FDRE 2018).\n\nRegional: There are three governing branches within the Tigray Regional State: a legislative, judicial, and executive branch. The legislative branch is governed by the regional council, which is the highest administrative body of the state. The judicial system at the regional level contains high courts, first instance courts and a regional supreme court, which is the highest judicial power (PEFA Assessment 11/12/2019; FDRE 2018).\n\nLocal: Local government in the region is considered to be decentralised, with the woreda possessing a high degree of autonomy from the regional administration (Bureau of Plan and Finance 2011). According to the Tigray regional state constitution, the elected legislative council is the highest form of government at the woreda level. Elected councils in each woreda have between 120-300 members who do not work full-time and are not paid. Committees are in place covering main issues including: budget and audit, women affairs, social and economic affairs, and legal and security affairs (Fiseha 25/02/2020).\n\nTabias are the lowest political administration level in Tigray, equivalent to kebeles, elsewhere in the country, and each serve between 500 and 900 households (6,000 to 10,000 people). A committee elected by the local community governs each Tabia (Wilkie Accessed 08/02/2021).\n\nThe formal local government system has been supplemented by a network of structures organised to enable development progress in rural areas, tied up with the TPLF party structures. These are sometimes referred to as the \"development army\" and operate through the \"one in five\" system which sought to ensure one in every five households was affiliated to the party. This has been responsible for mass mobilisation of local populations. With the TPLF leadership playing a key role in designing the system, it has been of particular importance in the Tigray region to a whole range of government activities, including health promotion and agricultural extension (Clingendael 09/2016; ICG 04/09/2009; Segers et al 01/2009)\n\nTigray's mass mobilisation campaigns are collective action activities carried about by 30- 40% of the population, who devote 20 days per year to unpaid voluntary labour projects, such as constructing public infrastructure or watershed management. In some parts of Tigray the community commits to an even higher voluntary workload by completing 20 days of planting in August and 20 days to soil and water works in February (Wilkie Accessed 08/02/2021). These campaigns and other local level structures in the region (kebeles, development steering committees, community associations and farmer representatives) have been closely tied to the party in the past.\n\nCivil society\n\nIn 2019, the Government of Ethiopia approved the Organisation of Civil Societies Proclamation and repealed the 2009 Charities and Societies Proclamation. This lifted a number of restrictive policies in place for civil society organisations, including foreign funding limits and restraints on particular work areas, such as human rights and governance (HRW 2021; CIVIVUS 03/05/2019; HRW 04/04/2019). Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in Tigray are regulated by the Tigray Regional Bureau of Justice and receive technical and operational support from the Bureau of Finance and Economic and Development.\n\nGovernance and rule of law According to the World Justice Project, in 2020 Ethiopia ranked 114/128 on the overall rule of law. It scored a total of 0.41 out of 1.0 in adherence to the rule of law, based on eight factors including constraints on government powers, open government, absence of corruption, fundamental rights, order and security, regulatory enforcement, civil justice, and criminal justice. It ranked particularly low (121/128) on open government (WJP 2020).\n\nCorruption\n\nAt the national level, the Federal Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission is in place to fight corruption across the country (UNDP 2011). According to Transparency International, Ethiopia ranked 94/180 in 2020 (TI 2021). There have been growing concerns in the country about corruption among the political elite, particularly the TPLF (IPS News 16/06/2013; Hassan 15/01/2019). Since Abiy Ahmed's became Prime Minister, the government has targeted senior Tigrayan officials involved in key financial and economic institutions such as METEC (the Metals and Engineering Corporation) and the Endowment Fund for the Rehabilitation of Tigray (EFFORT) (Clingandael, 2021).\n\nMechanisms in place to fight corruption in the region include the Tigray Regional State General Auditor, the Tigray Regional State's Ethic and Anti-Corruption Commission, courts, persecutors, and police officers. Anti-corruption awareness campaigns have been implemented at the regional and woreda levels. At the woreda level, the fight against corruption is dependent on the top-level management, who can employ accountability mechanisms and measures to enhance financial transparency (Setu 2017).\n\nEconomy and Social Protection Systems The currency used across Ethiopia is the Ethiopian Birr (ETB). The GDP per capita for Tigray in 2019 was USD 735 (Geographical 13/07/2020), lower than the national GDP per capita of USD 855.8 (World Bank 2019). The GDP for Tigray for the 2016/2017 fiscal year was 102,543 ETB (millions) (PEFA 11/12/2019).\n\nCOVID-19 is expected to have a substantial financial impact on the country. Political and social unrest is also expected to potentially reduce foreign investment and tourism and negatively impact on the economy (WB 13/10/2020).\n\nRemittances: Ethiopia has a large diaspora community, estimated to be around 2.5 million in 2020. Formal remittances accounted for 0.55% of Ethiopia's GDP in 2019 (WB 2019). The actual figure is likely to be higher and not captured in official data. Dependence on remittance income is becoming increasingly common in Tigray. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, remittances to Ethiopia have been negatively impacted. Estimates of an 80% reduction in remittance income received have been reported (The Reporter 02/05/2020).\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nOverall Investment: Between 1992 and 2017, Tigray received a large share of Ethiopia's total domestic investment, and specific investment across agricultural, manufacturing, and construction sectors (see Table 14 - Investment in Tigray from 1997-2017 in annex for more information). In 1995, EFFORT was established, facilitating the establishment of a range of factories and commercial entities in the region (SIDA 03/2003). In 1996, 2.8% of the total number of manufacturing establishments in Ethiopia were located in Tigray, and by 2009 this had grown to 9.2% (Fenta 2014). Between 2012 and 2019 Tigray consistently ranked in the top three out of all regions in Ethiopia for number of micro and small-scale enterprises (MSEs), which directly contributes to the reduction of poverty and unemployment (NBE 2020; NBE 2019; NBE 2018; NBE 2017; NBE 2016; NBE 2015; NBE 2014; NBE 2013; Bureau of Plan and Finance 11/2011)\n\nStability of the currency Ethiopia has struggled with high inflation rates over the last decade. In 2011, the country's inflation stood at 32%, compared with the global average of 4.8% (WB 2021a; WB 2021A). Ethiopia's inflation dropped to 6% in 2014, but began to rise again in 2015 (WB 2021b). In order to boost exports, the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) devalued the Ethiopian Birr (ETB) by 15% in 2017 (Reuters 10/10/2017). The devaluation led to an increase in annual inflation across the country, which in 2019 was 15.8% (WB 12/2019). During the 2019/20 fiscal year overall inflation in Tigray was the highest in Ethiopia, at 24.3% (NBE 2020). In May 2020, the NBE introduced a cash withdrawal limit across Ethiopia for individuals (200,000 ETB daily/1 million ETB per month) and companies (300,000 ETB daily/2.5 million ETB per month) at all commercial banks and microfinance institutions to prevent tax evasion, illegal transactions, and money laundering (NBE 19/05/2020). In September 2020, the government of Ethiopia brought in new bank notes for the ETB 10, 50, and 100 denominations, in a bid to combat corruption and contraband (NBE 14/09/2020). As at September 2020, inflation had risen to 33% (IPC 10/12/2020)\n\nBanking Banking system: The Ethiopian financial system is notably underdeveloped. According to the Global Competitiveness Report 2019, the country ranks 107/141 globally for its financial system (WEF 2019). The financial system is tightly controlled and dominated by the state-owned Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, which accounts for around 60% of the country's banking activities. While foreign owned banks are granted licences to create representation offices in Ethiopia, full foreign bank functionality is not possible, reinforcing the dominance of stateowned banks (FT 03/11/2021).\n\nThere are number of Rural Saving and Credit Cooperative Societies (RUSACOs) in Tigray region, which are owned, controlled, and capitalised by their members. In 2006 there were 1,417 cooperatives in Tigray, but with a low membership rate of only 0.5% of the region's population (Tirfe 2014).\n\nPersonal bank accounts: In 2017, 35% of adults held a bank account in Ethiopia, which was below the average of sub-Saharan Africa (43%) and globally (58.2%) of the same year (Global Economy 2021; World Bank 12/2019). There are disparities in the use of financial accounts between urban and rural residents and between men and women. In 2016, 15% of women aged 15-49 used a bank account in Ethiopia, compared with 25% of men. 44% of urban women used a bank account compared with 7% of rural women (CSA 07/2017).\n\nMobile system: M-Birr has been active in Ethiopia since 2013. However, mobile banking penetration is still low; M-Birr only had an estimated 1.8 registered million users across Ethiopia as reported in September 2020 (Mobile World Live 21/09/2020).\n\nSocial protection mechanisms\n\nThe Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) was launched in 2005 to address the chronic needs of food-insecure rural households through five outcomes: ensure food consumption, prevent asset depletion, improve access to services, stimulate markets through use of cash transfers, and restore natural environment through public works (Pearson et al 08/2016; FDRE MoLSA 01/2016). The PSNP system provides cover to workers during the six months of the year where agricultural activities are minimal and to directly support households that do not have any adult over 18 who can carry out labour (Pearson et al 08/2016).\n\nThe PSNP covers 31 woredas in Tigray (UNICEF 12/2019A). The urban PSNP was introduced in 2016 to cover cities across Ethiopia, including Mekele (World Bank 20/11/2015). PSNP is distributed either as Permanent Direct Support (PDS), or Public Works and Temporary Direct Support (PW). Households qualify based on selection criteria. PW households receive transfers for 6 months of the year, conditional on the able-bodied adults of the household engaging in public works, such as watershed development. PDS households receive 12 months of unconditional transfers. In 2018, there were 1,010,752 PSNP recipients in Tigray, the majority qualifying through public works (please see Table 15 - Tigray PSNP Client Criteria and Transfers, 2018) (MoA 12/2014).\n\nSelection of households for the PSNP falls under the responsibility of the Community Food Security Task Force (CFSTF). The selection criteria for PW and PDS is the same for households, except when it comes to the profile of household members. When there is at least one household member over 18 and under 60, without mental or physical challenges, the household qualifies as a PW beneficiary. Temporary direct support occurs when a person is only temporarily unable to engage in public works (e.g. during pregnancy). If members of a household are not able-bodied they qualify for PDS support (MoA 12/2014).\n\nDistributions are made by the woreda as cash, food transfers, or food vouchers. Food is distributed where there is poor functioning of food markets, high market food price, lack of experience in cash management. Monthly transfers of food are 15kg of cereal and 14kg of pulses. Food vouchers are used where markets are weak but improving. Cash is used where there are active food markets, near food surplus (in woreda or neighbouring woreda), and capacity of cash management (FDRE MoA 12/2014).\n\nCash payment in Tigray is distributed by the Woreda Office of Finance and Economic Development (WOFED). A payment software - Payroll Attendance Software System (PASS) - is used by WOFED to generate payrolls. In situations where PASS cannot be utilised (e.g. lack of electricity) WOFED, in conjunction with the Woreda Agriculture Office (WAO), can use Excel to prepare attendance and payroll, though this solution is only designed to be temporary. In order to collect PSNP, a client card is required. In Tigray, households can designate a person to collect transfer payments on their behalf (FDRE MoA 12/2014).\n\nHealth insurance coverage is low across Ethiopia, as no comprehensive system is in place. In 2016, roughly 88% of women and men in Tigray did not have any health insurance coverage, which is lower than the national average of 94.7% for women and 93.9% of men with no coverage (CSA 07/2017). A Community Based Health Insurance (CBHI) scheme was implemented in 2011 to reduce financial barriers in seeking healthcare. In 2018, 69% percent of Tigray's woredas were covered by CBHI, although coverage of the population was low (20% of total regional population) (USAID 06/08/2018). Only 1.9% of women and 2.6% of men are registered with social security (CSA 07/2017).\n\nPension: The social insurance programme, or pension, in Ethiopia is available to both private and public sectors and covers work injury in addition to pensions. Only 7.4% of the national population is covered by one or more social protection benefits (ILO 2020; Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs 26/03/2012).\n\nChild Benefits: Households with vulnerable children may be provided with grants, micro credits, or training designed to improve the livelihood of the household. Orphaned children may receive support from the government such as the provision of school materials, food, and shelter (Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs 26/03/2012)\n\nOther benefits: The government provides some support to people with disabilities through various associations, but the number of direct beneficiaries is minimal. In order to stabilise inflation, the government provides subsidies on grain costs for low-income households (Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs 26/03/2012)\n\nOther Cash Transfer Programmes\n\nCommunity Care Coalitions (CCCs) are operational in Tigray and provide social protection actions through the investment locally collected resources. As at 2009, CCCs were active in nearly all tabias (Pearson et al 08/2016). Loans and financial support to people in need have been additionally provided by civil society organisations in Tigray (BC 2021).\n\nLegal Frameworks\n\nInternational Humanitarian Law (IHL)\n\nEthiopia is party to the 1949 Geneva Conventions including Additional Protocols I, II and III, the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 2000 Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. On a regional level, it is party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa (HRW 25/11/2020; ICRC accessed 04/02/2021).\n\nRefugee laws\n\nEthiopia is a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, its 1967 Protocol, and adopted the 1969 OAU Refugee Convention but made reservations to certain rights such as freedom of movement and right of employment (UN accessed 03/02/2021; UNHCR 10/2006; ODI 2019). 2019 marked a shift in Ethiopia's refugee policy as the government replaced the former 2004 Refugee Proclamation with a revised law. The revised law grants refugees and asylum seekers previously restricted rights such as access to primary education, health and national financial services and ensured freedom of movement and residence (UNHCR 18/01/2019, ECRE 22/02/2019). Previously, the government followed an encampment policy only, and Eritrean refugees was the only refugee group permitted to relocate to urban centres under the government's Out of Camp Policy (ODI 2019). In February 2020 Ethiopia ratified the Kampala Convention for the protection and assistance of IDPs in Africa (UNHCR 14/02/2020).\n\nCrime and security There is very little reliable data available on crime in Ethiopia. No data on homicides is available for Tigray. In 2012, the homicide rate in Ethiopia was 8.8 per 100,000 people (UNODC, accessed 03/02/2021).\n\nThe border areas with Eritrea and Sudan are characterised by crime and insecurity (OSAC 10/04/2020). Crime dynamics in urban centres in Tigray are comparable to urban areas in Ethiopia in general, meaning they are mostly opportunistic (OSAC 10/04/2020). The occurrence of muggings and assaults has been reported for example in Mekele, and petty theft is often perpetrated by local crime networks (Gebru 2017).\n\nInfrastructure\n\nHousing The average household size in Tigray is 4.2 people, while the national average is 4.7 (CSA 12/2020). The household size in rural areas is higher than in urban areas (FDRE 2019). In 2016, only 10.4% of households in Tigray (compared to 12% at a national level) lived in housing constructed with adequate material necessary to protect against adverse weather conditions and health and structural hazards (UNICEF 12/2019A). 65.2% of households lived in a residence that was privately owned, 29.5% in rented housing and 5.3% lived rent free (CSA 2019). Vernacular housing in Ethiopia can be classified by the wall type. While timber structures filled with earth are common across the country, stone-built houses, both round or rectangular, are characteristic in highlands of Tigray and Amhara regions due to the stone resources in the mountainous areas. The interior space is usually a single room with a fireplace (ShelterCluster 12/2018).\n\nElectricity\n\nThe energy sector was controlled by the government until privatisation began in 2013, and the state-owned company was split into Ethiopia Electric Power, managing generation and transmission, and the Ethiopian Electric Utility, which manages power distribution (AfricaReport 26/11/2013; USAID 2020). Almost all electricity produced for Ethiopia's grid comes from renewable energy sources, with 90% from hydropower, leaving the country's energy sector vulnerable to droughts. The remaining sources are solar, wind, and thermal energy (HSF 30/09/2020, USAID 2020). Tekezé Hydroelectric Dam in Tigray has a capacity to produce 300MW of electric power, and nearby Ashegoda windfarm up to 120MW (NewBusinessEthiopia 10/05/2019). Tigray also has two wind farms in Mekele, capable of producing 300MW combined per year (UNFCCC 16/09/2015). In 2018, 50.9% of Tigray households had grid access, 36.9% of households used off-grid solutions (20.2% used a solar lighting system and 16.6% a solar lantern) and 12.3% had no access to any electricity sources (WB 2018).\n\nHealth infrastructure\n\nWhile the Federal Ministry of Health is tasked with the development of policy, regional health bureaus in Ethiopia adapt policies, are responsible for monitoring and evaluation of the performance, and provide technical assistance to the districts which are the main implementers of strategic plans (San Sebastian, 2010).\n\nThe administrative structure of the health system in Tigray consists of a Bureau of Health (BoH) at the regional level and Health Offices at the zone and woreda levels (FDRE 11/12/2019).\n\nA national strategy to train women from local communities to serve as health extension workers in health posts has facilitated a major expansion of primary healthcare units since 2003 (WHO 2015, WB 2011). The number of extension workers deployed in Tigray nearly doubled between 2005 and 2015 (WB 2011), and in 2017, there were 577 health officers, 2,017 nurses, and 650 midwives across 51 districts in Tigray (Woldemichael 2019). The most visited health facility in Tigray are health centres (46.1%) which is similar to the national average (44.3%). Hospitals in Tigray are utilized more frequently (23.9%) compared to the national level (15.8%) (CSA 12/2020).\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Health 2016 assessment, Tigray had a health service readiness score of 61% which was higher than the national average of 54%. The score is based on the mean availability of five general service categories (basic amenities, basic equipment, standard precautions, diagnostics, essential medicines) (WHO / FDRE MoH 2017). Please see Table 17 and Table 16 for more information.\n\nEducation infrastructure\n\nBased on the 2019/20 Education Statistics Abstract there were 2,221 primary schools and 271 secondary schools in Tigray. Schools in Tigray have a higher percentage of electricity, water, and sanitation access than the national average (both for primary and secondary schools) except for toilet access in secondary schools. The majority of schools in Tigray use hydroelectric as a source of energy, followed by solar power and generator (FDRE MoE 20/09/2020). Please see Table 18 - Educational infrastructure in Tigray 2019/20 in the annex for more information.\n\nTelecommunications\n\nEthiopia's telecommunications industry has remained under monopolistic control by the state-owned provider Ethio Telecom, but the government started to privatise the market in 2018 (Aljazeera 05/02/2021). In January 2020, there were 46.75 million mobile connections in Ethiopia, 21.14 million internet users, and 6.2 million social media users (Datareportal accessed 9/2/2021). As at December 2019, 17.8% of the national population used the internet (Internetworldstats accessed 9/2/2021). In 2016, 62.1% of the population in Tigray owned a mobile phone compared to 53.3% on the national level (FDRE 2019). There remains a gap in recent information regarding the number of mobile phones and internet usage in Tigray.\n\nTransport infrastructure\n\nTransportation infrastructure in Tigray is overall in good condition but particularly in rural areas, dirt roads are common and may be inaccessible during rainy season. The road network connects Mekele with other trading towns in the region as well as with Asmara, Eritrea (via Adigrat) and with Addis Ababa (USAID 11/2016). Between 1997 and 2015, the national roads network in Ethiopia has quadrupled, yet road density still remained the lowest in Africa in 2017 (WB 22/09/2017). Most of the country-wide increase in road density between 2006 and 2016 was in Tigray along with Addis Ababa and Oromia (WB 21/09/2017). Tigray scored higher than the national average in the Rural Access Index (RAI) which measures the proportion of rural population living within 2km of all-season roads (WB 2016). Please see Table 19 - Rural Access Index (RAI), 2016 in the annex for more information. There is a lack of recent data on road length in Tigray, particularly for paved roads.\n\nAlula Aba Nega Airport is an international airport in Mekele. Domestic airports or airstrips existed in Dansha, Axum, Shire, and Humera (WFP/LogCluster 25/01/2021, WFP/LogCluster 11/11/2020, AFDB 2017).\n\nLogistics Overview Tigray, June 2020\n\nSource: LogisticsCluster 06/2020\n\nEnvironment\n\nClimate and weather\n\nThree rainfall seasons occur across Tigray: Asmera scattering rains (April to June, Belg (February to May), and Kremti (Mid-June to mid-September). The main rainfall seasons in Tigray are the belg and kremti (see Table 22- Livelihood Zones Tigray).\n\nEnvironmental Degradation\n\nTigray has experienced heavy cultivation, overgrazing, and deforestation, leading to erosion of land. Land degradation particularly affects Tigray due to population density, agricultural practices, climate change, the steep topography and intermittent as well as extreme rainfalls (Wilkie Accessed 08/02/2021; FDRE 2018; WB 15/10/2014). Steps to reduce soil erosion, such as physical conservation, have taken place; approximately 808,600 hectares of farm area are protected against soil erosion in the region (CSA 05/2020;WV 07/2010; Nyssen et al 2007).\n\nClimate change\n\nOngoing drought brought on by climate change is impacting the region, where the agriculture sector is dependent on rains (Fekele et al 01/10/2016). In Western Tigray, an increase of maximum temperature and a decline in rainfall was recorded between 1983 and 2006 (Berhane 18/02/2020). In a 2013 study, farmers across the region reported a perceived increase in late onset and early termination of the Kremti season since 1980 (Hadgu 06/2013). The past 15 years has seen an unreliable Belg rainy season in the region; most recently the 2020 season in some parts of Tigray was not sufficient to support agriculture production (USAID 11/2016; IPC 09/2020).\n\nThe productivity of livestock is impacted by thermal, nutritional, and water-related stresses brought on by climate change (Fekele et al 01/10/2016). The most common adaptation to climate change across lowlands, midlands, and highlands of Tigray, is the practice of farmers selling their livestock during extreme climatic shocks (Fekele et al 01/10/2016).\n\nHazards\n\nEach year Tigray is susceptible to intermittent and chronic natural hazards that reduce crop production potential, threaten livestock, and undermine livelihoods, including drought, floods, hailstorms, frost, and pest infestations, such as desert locust. Pests and diseases pose risks to crop production, including striga weed, which has the potential to reduce maize and sorghum yields by one-third. Moderate to severe droughts, occurring every two to five years, reduce water availability and raise livestock diseases, such as pasteurellosis (Ethiopia Livelihoods Baseline Profiles 11/2016). In 2019/2020, land holders reported both too much rain and too little rain as the main reasons for damage to crop area (CSA 05/2020). For more information on type and location of natural hazards see Table 20- Natural hazards in Tigray in the annex.\n\nNatural resources\n\nTigray has mineral resources, including metallic minerals such as copper, iron ore, gold, zinc, nickel, and lead. It is also rich in non-metallic minerals including silica sand, asbestos, kaolin, gypsum, marble, granite, limestone, and dolomite (FDRE 2018). Some of the minerals are mined by artisanal miners, while others are under investigation for mining potential (Bureau of Plan and Finance 11/2011). Gold mining is typically small-scale, involving shallow mining, deep mining, and surface mining techniques (Hagos et al 2016).\n\nWater resources\n\nWater sources in Tigray rely on ground water, rainwater, and surface water (Bureau of Plan and Finance 11/2011). Two international rivers pass through Tigray, the Mereb and the Tekeze, which originates in the northern highlands (FDRE 2018). Other small rivers include Geba, Worii, Berber, Arquo and Teter (USAID 11/2016). The majority of holders in Tigray rely on river sources for irrigation (see section on irrigation for more information (CSA 05/2020).\n\nLand and agriculture\n\nLand management: In Tigray's highlands, agriculture is characterised predominately by small-scale family farms (Nyssen et al 06/2009). Please see Table 21 - Crop Area and Land Holders in Tigray the annex for more information.\n\nDifferent land tenure systems have been in place over time in Tigray, influencing land management in the region (Hagos et al 07/1999). Ethiopian reform of land, implemented in Tigray in the late 1990s, asserts that all land is state owned. Land is then tenured to households on the bases of supporting livelihoods, including arable land for peasants (Dokken 2015). As at 2017, the average household landholding in Tigray is around 0.6 hectares (ha), and at least 78% hold land between 0.01ha and 1.0ha (PEFA Assessment 2018).\n\nAgriculture: Cultivated crops are an important part of agriculture for the region (see Table 22- Livelihood Zones Tigray). Production throughout most of the region occurs during the meher-season, reliant on the kremti rains. In southern areas of Tigray, there are two production seasons through the belg and kremti. Land preparation begins as early as January and October typically marks the start of the harvest (Figure 1) (USAID 11/2016).\n\nLivestock In all zones, except Western Zone, livestock cash income is more substantial than income from cash crops. Cattle, such as oxen, are largely owned by middle- or higher-income groups in Tigray. Poor households that do not own cattle rent their lands to wealthier households in exchange for a share of the harvest (LIU 2010). In the highlands of Tigray, transhumance (seasonal herd movements between two points that are repeated along the same routes each year) of maximum 20km is practiced, particularly during the crop-growing season. Transhumance has been linked with an increased risk of livestock disease in Tigray (Nyssen et al 06/2009).\n\nIrrigation\n\nSince Tigray has many arid and semi-arid areas, effective water utilisation and irrigation systems are important (Hagos, 2005). Farmers in Tigray commonly use conventional irrigation practices rather than mechanised irrigation (Haile, 2019). Common surface irrigation methods in Tigray include river diversion, spring development and pond systems, and diversion structures made of stones and wood prone to being destroyed in case of flooding (Teshome, 2003). Farmers consider drip irrigation without motorised pumps inappropriate for the sandy soil type (FarmAfrica).\n\nPRE-CRISIS LIVING CONDITIONS\n\nPoverty\n\nIn the past 20 years, poverty in Tigray has decreased due to agricultural growth and investments in basic services and social protection. Between 2011 and 2016, the poverty rate in Tigray declined from 31.8% to 27%; however, this was the highest poverty rate in the country in 2016, with the national average being 23.5% (WB 04/2020). Poverty rates are significantly higher in rural areas of Tigray than in urban areas. In 2016, the poverty rate stood at 31.1% in rural areas and 14.2% in urban areas (WB 04/2020). Deprivation in housing and sanitation is the key contributor to the multi-dimensional child deprivation (MCD) rate for children under 18 years in Tigray, who have a deprivation rate of 80% (national average of 88%). This means that 1.8 million children are considered deprived of fulfilment of their basic needs, services, and rights (UNICEF 12/2019A). Monetary poverty affects women in Tigray disproportionately at 43% (compared to 22% of men), and the most affected areas are the South Eastern and Southern zones (UNICEF 12/2019A). Like most other regions of Ethiopia, Tigray has seen an increase in inequality due to consumption growth only among wealthier parts of society (WB 18/11/2020). According to a study on poverty in a rural woreda in the Eastern zone, the main factors associated with poverty are family size and the dependency ratio, due to the burden of supporting additional family members, especially children or elderly who are unable to provide income; the educational level of the head of household; household access to credit; access to non-farm income; and value of owned assets (Afera 2015).\n\nLivelihoods and employment\n\nAs the population of Tigray is largely rural, most households are dependent on agriculture, mainly subsistence crop farming (UNICEF 12/2019A). 26.5% of households in Tigray have non-farm enterprises, such as a shop or market trading (CSA 2019).\n\nEmployment levels In 2013, Tigray regional state had an overall unemployment rate of 5.5%, although the rate was higher among women than men. The urban unemployment rate was significantly higher than the rural unemployment rate for the region. Compared with national unemployment rates, Tigray had slightly higher rates across all categories. Women had the highest rates of unemployment in both urban and rural categories across Tigray and Ethiopia (CSA 2013). Please refer to Table 23 - Unemployment Rate, all ages (2013) or more information.\n\nIn a 2016 survey, 75% of men interviewed in Tigray stated to be currently employed, compared to 37% of women. 50% of employed men worked in agriculture, 18% in skilled and unskilled manual labour, and 8% in sales and services. Among employed women, 41% worked in agriculture, 29% in sales and services, and 18% in skilled and unskilled manual labour (CSA 07/2017).\n\nThere are 16 different livelihood zones in Tigray, which are homogenous areas sharing the same food production and market characteristics. These livelihood zones do not necessarily correspond to administrative divisions (FEWS Net, accessed 04/02/2021). Livelihoods in rural Tigray are mostly related to agriculture and labour. Especially poorer households with smaller land holdings and less livestock generate additional non-farm incomes through seasonal migratory labour, particularly to the sesame-producing Western zone, local agricultural work, and construction work in towns. Wealthier households tend to rely more on livestock sales for additional non-farm income (USAID 11/2016).\n\nPlease see Table 22- Livelihood Zones Tigray in the annex for an overview of the main livelihood trends of each administrative zone, grouping together the main livelihood zones for each division. This table represents a synthesis of 16 individual livelihood profiles and a regional summary report.\n\nSource: FEWS Net 2018. Note that division between Southern and South Eastern administrative zones is not displayed on the map.\n\nFood security\n\nAvailability and accessibility of food in the highland areas, including Tigray, are typically highest during the meher harvest between September and January (USAID/FDRE MoARD 2010).\n\nKey challenges for food security and households' own food production in Tigray include:\n\n• Reliance of crop production on rainy seasons, which are short in some areas. Irregularity in onset, end, or amount of precipitation has the potential to disrupt harvests.\n\n• Soil fertility, which is particularly a problem in eastern Tigray due to land degradation, as well as erosion in highlands.\n\n• Reduction of available land for crop cultivation and livestock grazing per household. Most households cannot meet their food needs from their own production but need to purchase food, thus requiring additional sources of income (predominantly from labour and sales) (USAID 11/2016).\n\nIn the October-December 2020 period, not accounting for the full food security impact of the armed conflict, over 429,000 people were in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse levels of acute food insecurity (see Table 3 below). These figures represent a deterioration in comparison to August 2020. Even without integrating the full impact of the armed conflict into the analysis, the food security situation in Tigray was projected to deteriorate in 2021. At the national level, for the October-December 2020 period, 1.4 million people were in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and 7.1 million in Crisis (IPC 10/12/2020).\n\nAmong the environmental factors that negatively impacted food security prior to November 2020, are desert locust infestations, with damage to Meher crops. As at April 2020, the loss of cereal in Tigray due to the desert locust infestation is estimated at 843,241ha in total, and sorghum losses accounting 20,956ha (Joint Assessment 04/2020). Desert Locust was registered in 19 woredas of four administrative zones, particularly in Central, Eastern, and South Eastern zones. This, combined with a late start and early end of Azmera rains (March-May) which affected long-cycle crops, and heavy rainfall and flooding which impacted crops as well, had a negative impact on food insecurity. In terms of socioeconomic drivers of food insecurity, COVID-19 led to reduced remittances and livelihood opportunities as well as market disruptions, while price increases were also reported, with inflation in Tigray reaching 33% in September 2020 (IPC 10/12/2020).\n\nNutrition\n\nTrends of nutrition data indicate a significant improvement of the nutritional status of children in Tigray between 2011 and 2019, however the rates for stunting, wasting, and underweight remain above the national average. Factors that impact children's nutrition in Tigray include child feeding and child caring practices, lack of access to water and sanitation, and the food security impact of the 2015/16 El Niño (UNICEF 12/2019A).\n\nA 2010 study in Tigray found differences in undernutrition between different zones. Stunting was most prevalent in Southern and Central zones, while wasting was most prevalent in Central and North Western zones. The study identified the high population density, which leads to households using smaller land holdings, as the key driver behind the high prevalence of wasting and stunting in Central zone in comparison with the other zones (Mulugeta et al 06/2010).\n\nAt the end of September 2020, the nutrition situation was on a deteriorating trend, with admissions for severe acute malnutrition increased by 9.5% compared to the previous month - potentially due to seasonality as this period coincided with the lean season in Tigray (pre Meher harvest) (ENCU 09/2020).\n\nHealth Tigray presents better health indicators than the national averages. Please see Table 24 - Key Health indicators the annex for a full overview.\n\nLife expectancy and mortality Recent specific information on Tigray was not available. The 2018 life expectancy in Ethiopia was 66.2 years (WB accessed 9/2/2021), (64.5 for males and 68.2 for women) (WB accessed 9/2/2021; WB Accessed 9/2/2021). The crude death rate was 6.5 per 1,000 (WB accessed 9/2/2021), and the top five causes of death at a national level are neonatal disorders, diarrhoeal disorders, lower respiratory infections, tuberculosis, and ischemic heart disease (CDC 08/2019).\n\nChild and infant mortality\n\nInfant and under-five mortality in Ethiopia have been on a steady declining trend in the past 15 years, but perinatal and neonatal mortality rates remain high (Woldeamanuel,Gelebo, 2019). With the exception of neonatal mortality, Tigray presents lower numbers than the national averages, and Tigray is the region with the second lowest under-five mortality in the country, after Addis Ababa (CSA 07/2017).\n\nMaternal mortality Home delivery is still common in Ethiopia. In 2019, 72.4% of births in Tigray were delivered at a health facility, well above the national average of 47.5% (FRDE MOH 08/2019). Maternal mortality in Ethiopia has been reduced by half since 2000 and stands at 401 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2017 (UNICEF accessed 17/02/2021, USAID 02/12/2020). There is a lack of regional data on maternal mortality rates in the 2016 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). A sample study from 2012/13. estimates that overall maternal mortality ratio in Tigray was 266 deaths per 100,000 live births (Godefay et al 2015, UNICEF 12/2019A). Most deaths (61%) were caused by direct obstetric causes and haemorrhage caused 34% of pregnancy-related deaths (Godefay et al 2015). Researchers have pointed out that maternal and perinatal deaths are not sufficiently monitored, as only 45.3% of health posts in Tigray practice early identification and notification of maternal/perinatal deaths (Ayele et al 2019).\n\nVaccination\n\nIn 2019, Tigray had the second highest rate (73%) of children age 12-23 months who have received all basic vaccinations in the country. The national average was 43% (FRDE MOH 08/2019).\n\nCommunicable diseases\n\nAcross Ethiopia in 2019, an estimated 650,000 adults and children were living with HIV, of whom 550,000 were aware of their status, and approximately 75% were receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) (UNAIDS accessed 10/2/2021). According to the 2016 Demographic and Health Survey, 32% of women and 25% of men had been tested for HIV in Tigray within the past year compared to 20% and 19% respectively at a national level (CSA 07/2017). The HIV prevalence in Tigray was 1.2% (CSA 01/2018).\n\nMalaria\n\nMalaria morbidity and mortality in Ethiopia has declined since 2000, and widespread epidemics have become rare since 2004 (USAID 2019). In most regions, the peak transmission period is from September to December after the main rainy season (Taffese et al 2018). Malaria is endemic in Tigray (Tasfahunegn et al 2019). In 2015, 13.9% of all malaria cases in Ethiopia were diagnosed in Tigray (FDRE MoH 2016,FDRE MoH 2016; Tesfay et al 2019). Locations recording outbreaks in recent years are Humera, Asgede Tsimbila, and Tahay Adiyabo areas (Berhe et al 2019). In 2016, malaria diagnosis and treatment services were provided at almost all health facilities (WHO/ FDRE MoH 2017). However, there is a high level of delay in malaria treatment in Tigray, especially in North Western zone. Factors contributing to a high delay are long travel distances to health facilities, educational level, and involvement of head of household in the decision about seeking treatment (Tasfahunegn et al 2019). The 2015 malaria survey showed a low level of treatment-seeking for children with fever. Moreover, Tigray was the region with the second lowest percentage of women who recognised fever as a symptom of malaria (FDRE MoH 2016). For more information on malaria, please see Table 25 - Malaria indicators, 2015 in the annex.\n\nThere is also concern over the lack of attention to refugee-settings in the recent national malaria strategy, which is especially relevant because of malaria outbreaks at Hitsats refugee camp in the past, for instance in 2017 (Gebremichael et al 2020).\n\nTuberculosis\n\nThe prevalence of Tuberculosis in Ethiopia has dropped from 268/100,000 in 2010, to 140/100,000 in 2019, and the TB mortality rate (TB+HIV) declined to 21/100,000 in 2019 (WB accessed 18/2/2021; Treattb accessed 18/02/2021). In 2019, 12% of previously treated cases and 0.7% of new cases were MDR/rifampicin resistant (Treattb accessed 18/02/2021). According to a study performed between July 2018 and August 2019 in Tigray on 300 TB patients, 16.7% were MDR/TB, including 11.6% for new and 32.7% for previously treated. The high prevalence of MDR/TB among newly diagnosed cases indicates ongoing transmission (Welekidan et al 14/08/2020). Early diagnosis and treatment of TB is crucial. In Tigray, people living in rural areas, people with low income, and people who first seek treatment for example from traditional healers are more likely to experience delays in treatment initiation for TB, which is consistent with findings for Ethiopia in general (Tedla et al. 21/08/2020). In general terms, displaced populations face an increased risk of contracting tuberculosis and unsuccessful treatment due to overcrowding and inadequate shelter conditions, poor nutritional status and health, and reduced access to health care (Legesse et al. 03/02/2021). For example, one study in Gambella region in Ethiopia found that refugees had a lower TB success rate than the host community (Legesse et al. 03/02/2021).\n\nCholera Cholera is endemic in Ethiopia, with an ongoing outbreak since April 2019. Tigray has not been among the regions most affected, with only 2% of the national total of cases registered in Tigray between April and July 2019 (IFRC 16/07/2019).\n\nHealth services\n\nIn 2016, Tigray health facilities offered a higher percentage across all key health services compared with the average for Ethiopia. Higher results were found in particular for the provision of diagnosis/treatment of child malnutrition, for HIV counselling and testing services and tuberculosis services (see Table 26 - Availability of selected health services among health facilities in Tigray, 2016) In 2019, there were 249 health care facilities providing TB services in Tigray of which 105 facilities also provide services for HIV/AIDS (MSH 06/2019).\n\nProtection concerns This section summarises key protection concerns, primarily affecting women and children. For an analysis regarding refugees and IDPs, see section Pre-crisis humanitarian concerns and capacities. Please see Table 27 - Protection concerns for women and children in Tigray and Ethiopia in the annex for key indicators for Tigray and Ethiopia.\n\nSexual and gender-based violence (SGBV): There is a high prevalence of SGBV in Ethiopia. At the national level, the majority of perpetrators of physical and sexual violence are current or former husbands/partners, or, to a lesser extent, other relatives (CSA 07/2017). In Tigray, 65% of women and 31% of men agree that wife-beating is justified for at least one reason (such as, for example, burning food or refusing sexual intercourse), showing a significant normalisation of physical violence towards women (CSA 07/2017).\n\nFemale genital mutilation/circumcision (FGM)\n\nFGM has been criminalised in Ethiopia since the revision of the criminal code in 2005. FGM remains common, although attitudes around the practice have been changing (UNICEF 02/2016). At the national level, 87% men and 79% of women believe this practice should not be continued. In 2016, Tigray was the region with the lowest incidence of FGM in women between 15 and 49, well below the national average. In Ethiopia, FGM is performed throughout childhood, but most cases (49%) are reported for girls under the age of five (CSA 07/2017).\n\nAge In Tigray, 15% of older persons are without caregivers (OCHA HNO 2020).\n\nChild marriage The prevalence of child marriage in Tigray has reduced significantly over the last 30 years. In 1991, 80% of women aged 20-24 had been married before the age of 18. In 2016, this figure had dropped to 43% (UNICEF 04/2019). At the national level, there is a clear urban/rural divide, with women in urban settings marrying later than women from rural areas. Women's educational level also has an impact (UNICEF 2016).\n\nSince the revision of the Family Code in 2000, the minimum age of marriage in Ethiopia is set at 18 years for both men and women, and child marriage is criminalised under the Criminal Code. Practices of child marriage in Ethiopia are complex due to the country's ethnic and religious diversity, but can be summarised in three broader categories: arranged marriage, where marriage is decided between parents or families, sometimes early during childhood or even before birth; marriage by abduction, where men without the resources to pay a bride price abduct a woman in order to force a marriage, which is less common in Tigray compared to southern Ethiopia; marriage by choice, which is becoming more common in urban areas (UNICEF 03/20216). In Tigray, in 80% of cases, parents made the decision about marriage (CSA 07/2017).\n\nChild labour\n\nIn 2019, the Ethiopian government raised the minimum wage for employment from 14 to 15 years, with youth under 18 not allowed to be employed in hazardous activities (US DoL 2019). Nevertheless, child labour is common. Tigray is among the regions with the highest prevalence of child labour (UNICEF 12/2020).\n\nAt the national level, research found that higher education levels and increased household wealth decrease the incidence of child labour, with poverty identified as the main factor pushing children into child labour, due to the need to provide economic support to their families. Some children are also drawn into child labour by promises of receiving educational support or, in the case of children from rural areas, having better living conditions in urban centres. Boys are more likely than girls to be engaged in child labour, while girls are more likely to be taking on household chores (UNICEF 12/2020).\n\nTeenage pregnancy\n\nAccording to the 2016 Demographic and Health Survey, 12% of girls in Tigray aged 15-19 had started childbearing, which is the fourth lowest in the country and relatively low compared to other regions including Afar (23%), Somali (19%) and Oromia (17%). The national average is 13%. 64% of married women in Tigray are not using contraceptives, just below the national level of 68% (CSA 07/2017).\n\nHuman trafficking\n\nEthiopia is both a transit and an origin country for human trafficking for forced labour, sexual exploitation, and migrant smuggling (UNODC 12/11/2020; OCI 2019). Traffickers are larger organised crime groups as well as small local actors (US DoS 2020).Youth in western Tigray are particularly vulnerable to trafficking due the proximity of the border (Tafere et al 2017). Internal trafficking, the extent of which is unclear, often targets young people from rural areas, with victims pushed primarily into forced domestic labour and sex trafficking (US DoS 2020). As victims of human trafficking are often sent to cities, in Tigray, this particularly impacts the capital Mekele. In Tigray, trafficked children are also sent to Humera to work in the cultivation of sesame. A high prevalence of female-headed households, poverty, and lack of awareness have been identified as factors of vulnerability regarding child trafficking in Tigray, with the hidden nature of the issue posing a challenge for the identification of victims as well as for the understanding of the true extent of the problem (Kebede/Schmidt 2018).\n\nWASH\n\nPlease see Table 28 - Key WASH Indicators for Tigray and Ethiopia in the annex for specific indicators.\n\nAccess to water There is a slight difference in access to water between urban and rural areas in Tigray. 69.7% of urban population have access to potable water compared to 60.2% in rural areas. Women and girls are mostly responsible for fetching water in Tigray, which is the case overall Ethiopia (UNICEF 12/2019A).\n\nAccess to sanitation\n\nAccording to the 2007 census, the most common type of facility was shared pit latrines (FDRE 12/2008).\n\nMenstrual hygiene\n\nIn a 2015 study in Tigray, 84% of female respondents indicated that they purchased commercial products (commonly referred to as Modess) such as pads, while over 40% used home-made pads, for example made from discarded clothes. The high cost of commercial products was noted (Wall et al 12/2016).\n\nEducation\n\nBased on specific educational indicators, Tigray is performing better than the country averages, and well compared to its two neighbouring regions, particularly Afar. Table 5 below shows key education indicators for Tigray compared to national averages, as well as neighbouring Afar and Amhara.\n\nFor a broader list of education indicators please see Table 29 - Education indicators for 2019/20 school year Tigray, all of Ethiopia, Afar and Amhara.\n\n* Net Enrolment Ratio (NER) - is the percentage of children in a certain age group enrolled in that year. For pre-primary ages 4-6, for primary ages 7-14 and for secondary ages 15-18.\n\n** Above 100% ratios indicate mistakes in population projections and/or inaccurate recording of students.\n\nEnrolment\n\nTigray has seen substantial progress in enrolment numbers, and figures indicated that all primary school aged children are attending school, up from 92% in 2012/13 (FDRE MoE 20/09/2020; UNICEF 12/2019A). Tigray presents the largest difference compared to other regions in terms of NER between Grades 9-10 and Grades 11-12, showing that many students in Tigray leave the education system after grade 10 (FDRE MoE 20/09/2020).\n\nChild literacy\n\nFor 2016, the illiteracy rate among children aged 15 to 17 years was 30% in Tigray (an improvement from 33.8% in 2011), which means that close to one third of children of secondary school age cannot read a full sentence. This is considerably lower than the national average of 45.5% (which in fact was a slight deterioration from 45.2% in 2011) (UNICEF 12/2019A).\n\nDespite improvements in literacy and enrolment, and presenting overall higher education indicators than national averages, including student teacher ratios, repetition and dropout rates, Tigray faces challenges in terms of the quality of education, particularly in rural schools. One highlighted concern is that teachers are assigned to teach subjects for which they lack adequate qualifications (UNICEF 12/2019A).\n\nPRE-CRISIS HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS AND CAPACITIES\n\nExisting displacement and refugees\n\nIDPs\n\nAs at October 2020, there were 100,581 IDPs identified in Tigray by the IOM Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), most of them displaced by conflict from Amhara and Oromia between 2016 and 2019 (OCHA 05/2019, IOM DTM 30/11/2020). Since 2016 conflict-related displacement in Ethiopia has increased significantly and rapid response has at times been delayed because humanitarian response had to adapt to this new operational reality (MSF 06/2019). Response delays affected IDPs in Tigray. In May 2019, IDPs had only received irregular food assistance and the response was led by private or local administration-led initiatives (OCHA 05/2019). As at August 2020, the key health concerns in Tigray IDP sites were malaria and pneumonia, according to DTM surveys.\n\nFollowing the implementation of a national return policy in 2019, there were concerns over IDP returns being voluntary and safe and the lack of assistance in areas of return (PC 25/03/2019;l OCHA 05/2019). IOM identified 5,565 returned IDPs in Tigray in September 2020 (IOM DTM 30/11/2020).\n\nLessons learned from previous conflict-related displacement crises in Ethiopia suggest that official IDP figures should be used with caution in emergencies since they depend on validation of regional authorities and do not necessarily reflect recent population movements (MSF 06/2019).\n\nRefugees As at 4 November, there were 95,916 Eritrean refugees in Tigray (UNHCR 20/10/2020). 30,670 Eritrean refugees in Tigray (32%) had at least one specific need. 44.5% of all families had a female head of household and there were 45 children at the head of their households (UNHCR 14/12/2020). The high number of unaccompanied children among pre-crisis refugees in Tigray is a particular concern; accommodating them with other families is a challenge (ODI 2020; UNHCR 26/05/2020). There is a lack of mental health services especially for SGBV and trafficking survivors and not enough shelter, blankets, or kitchen sets are provided in the camps. Water trucking is needed in Mai Aini and Adi Harush camps due to the limited amount of water points (UNHCR 26/05/2020).\n\nIn March 2020, the Ethiopian government informed UNHCR that it plans to close Hitsats camp (UNHCR 26/05/2020). Earlier the same year, the government had started shifting from a prima facie determination to individual refugee status determination leading to concerns about the situation of refugees who are not registered (HRW 21/04/2020). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Ethiopian authorities closed the border with Eritrea in March 2020 and ARRA suspended the reception of asylum-seekers at the border (UNHCR 26/05/2020).\n\nSince the Ethiopian-Eritrean border opening in 2018, refugees in the camps have been concerned about being targeted by Eritrean authorities (ODI 2020).\n\nThe Eritrean refugee population is diverse in ethnic, linguistic, age, and social background. Some arrived decades ago. This results in different needs and varying access to services in host communities that differ between camps. Adi Harush camp, for instance, hosts mainly young, single, male, urban refugees, while Shimelba camp hosts many Kunama refugees displaced decades ago. Many young refugees, especially in Adi Harush camp, want to resettle in a third country via Sudan and Libya, putting them at risk of human trafficking (ODI 2020, Southworld 01/07/2019).\n\nDesert locust and drought\n\nIn 2019, below average rainfall during the kiremt rainfall and unseasonable rainfall impacted the meher harvest in Tigray. Production was below average in most areas of eastern and southern Tigray (FEWS NET 07/03/2020). Simultaneously, an outbreak of desert locust, beginning in October 2019, led to pasture and crop loss (OCHA 03/11/2019; OCHA HNO 09/01/2020). By May 2020, the infestation had damaged 84,000 metric tons of cereal crops throughout the region, affecting at least 43,000 people (IPC 19/05/2020).\n\nCOVID-19\n\nA state of emergency was declared in Tigray on 26 March 2020 and a COVID-19 testing laboratory was established on 1 April in Mekele (ACAPS; Africa News 19/05/2020). On 7 May, the first four cases of COVID-19 were registered in Tigray (Africa News 19/05/2020). In mid-October, the overall number of COVID-19 cases in Tigray stood at 6,340, the last available figure before the outbreak of fighting on 4 November (OCHA 18/10/2020). As at September, 175 health personnel in Tigray were reported to have been infected with COVID-19 (OCHA 18/09/2020). Considering reported shortages of testing kits and reagents (OCHA 18/10/2020), it is likely that the overall number of COVID-19 cases in Tigray is considerably higher. In Ethiopia in general, the response to the pandemic is hampered by misinformation among the population, and low government capacity regarding prevention activities and epidemiological surveillance (OCHA 24/01/2021).\n\nThe socioeconomic impact of the pandemic in Tigray has been significant. According to the Ethiopian Economics Association, as of July 2020, Tigray was among the five regions with the highest incidence of income reduction (EEA 07/2020).\n\nInformation and community perceptions\n\nLevel of information disseminated The dissemination of information is highly controlled in Ethiopia and freedom of media is low. According to the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index 2020, under the \"right to information indicator\", Ethiopia ranked 107/128 countries surveyed (WJP 2020). Information through mass media is predominately via state-owned channels, which tend to support the government's policies and political positions. The state-owned Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation (EBC), regional TV stations, and regional radio stations are restricted on the political content they broadcast, and journalists report reduced access to government information. There are limitations on private investment in telecommunications and the printing press. The 19 privately newspapers have a low print rate (approximately 15,000 newspapers per issue), as they rely on state-owned printing presses; private printing presses are banned (IMS 10/2018).\n\nThe Government's control of Ethiotelecom has led to high prices that have added a barrier in accessing information for many Ethiopians. Ethiopian government has exercised internet and communications blackout during times of unrest (IMS 10/2018).\n\nChannels and sources of information\n\nEthiopian government controls all telecommunication services in the country and has laws in place that restrict media freedom. The Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation (EBC) is a stateowned media outlet headquartered in Addis Ababa, covering both radio and television. As highlighted in Table 6 exposure to media through newspaper was low in Tigray compared to television and radio.\n\nAcross the country there are 25 publicly owned radio stations, including regional stations, four public newspapers, numerous state-owned regional newspapers, 19 privately owned newspapers. There is growing access to social media particularly among the younger population of Ethiopia (IMS 10/2018). Social media sites, such as Facebook, are also frequently used, including by regional entities including the Tigray Communication Affairs Bureau (Tigray CAB Facebook, Accessed 05/02/2021). The Ethiopian Institute of Ombudsman, which plays a role in ensuring citizens' access to information, has had a regional branch office open in Tigray since 2011 (UNDP 2011).\n\nUse of media\n\nMedia infrastructure across the country is poor and use of information channels such as mass media is low in Tigray, particularly among women (see Table 6 below). In 2016, over 71% of women and 46% of men did not access any media per week (CSA 07/2017).\n\nThere is no information available on rumours and misconceptions, trust in information and perception of needs.\n\nPre-crisis response capacity\n\nHistorical coping strategies and mechanisms\n\nHistorically, households in Tigray responded to food insecurity by reducing expenditure of non-essential or expensive items. Seeking labour in other areas including seasonal agricultural employment for instance at sesame farms in Humera, local labour, and casual work in urban areas is common among poor households while wealthier households tend to sell livestock. Sale of assets can also include crops and trees. Trade in goods such as sugar, livestock trading, and crop trading were additional strategies (REST 1994; USAID 11/2016). In 2019, assessments of locus-affected areas in Tigray identified the following livelihoods coping strategies in Tigray: sent household members elsewhere, consumed seed stocks, sold last breeding/female animals, sent an adult member of household to work, reduced expenditure on livestock and agricultural expenditures, reduced essential non-food expenditures, sold more animals, borrowed money/food. Seed consumption and the sale of breeding animals are seen as last resort coping strategies (Joint Assessment 04/2020). Poor communities affected by droughts supplement their income by selling wood and charcoal, contributing to deforestation (WV 07/2010).\n\nNational capacity\n\nIn the event of a shock, the government engages in disaster risk management activities by providing those affected with emergency food resources and non-food services, including health and nutrition, agricultural and livestock services, and WASH (FDRE MoLSA 26/03/2012). The Ministry of Agriculture provides materials to farmers in the region for the application of chemicals to reduce pests. Some livestock vaccinations are provided by the Ministry of Livestock, either free of charge or for a fee (USAID 11/2016). Additional disaster risk management activities include early warning, planning and financing, and institutional capacity building (FDRE MoLSA 26/03/2012).\n\nAll NGOs in Ethiopia are required to register with the government (K4D 21/08/2019). As at August 2020, there are three national NGOs operating in Tigray, with the highest number based in North Western Zone (see Table 30 - Humanitarian presence in Tigray (as at 3W August 2020). There are four government agencies implementing food, nutrition, and WASH activities, with the highest number in North Western Zone, followed closely by Central and Southern Zones (OCHA 23/10/2021). Regarding refugee response, as at August 2020 the government agency ARRA provided shelter, nutrition, education, health, and food. A small number of national NGOs were also active in the refugee response, covering protection and nutrition sectors (UNHCR 12/10/2020).\n\nInternational Capacity\n\nAs at August 2020, there were eight international NGOs and UN agencies present in Tigray (see Table 30 - Humanitarian presence in Tigray (as at 3W August 2020). Eastern Zone had the highest concentration of international agencies, whereas Mekele had the most UN agencies. Food, WASH, and nutrition were covered in five out seven zones (OCHA 23/10/2021). As at October 2020, a number of international NGOs and UN agencies were operational for the refugee response in Tigray, including IRC, NRC, WFP, UNHCR and others (UNHCR 12/10/2020).\n\nPre-crisis humanitarian access constraints\n\nIn previous years, humanitarian access incidents, such as violence against humanitarian personnel and assets, was much less common in Tigray than in other, conflict-affected regions of Ethiopia. Between January and June 2020, only 2% of the total humanitarian access incidents in Ethiopia were recorded in Tigray, and only 1% In 2019 (OCHA 28/01/2020).\n\nWhile Tigray's road infrastructure is generally good, there are physical access constraints related to the topography of the region and the impact of rains on road infrastructure. During the rainy season, road access is hampered, with dirt roads, for example in mountainous areas, becoming impassable. Some villages in remote, rural areas do not have road access, with access only via footpaths (OCHA 08/01/2020; USAID 11/20).\n\nBureaucratic constraints on INGOs in Ethiopia arising from 2009 legal guidelines were somewhat alleviated by a new law in 2019; however, challenges remain. The Ethiopian government retains oversight over the NGO sector, with regulations regarding registration, funding allocation, and reporting (Broeckhoven et al 30/07/2020).\n\nIn Ethiopia, access to aid for IDPs and humanitarian organisations' access to IDPs has been of particular concern. For example, in 2019, IDPs in Gedeo, SNNP zone, access to aid was restricted to encourage returns. Concerns around returns being forced were raised by humanitarian actors (US State Dep 03/2020; Guardian 15/05/2019).\n\n2 1\n\nANNEX - KEY INDICATOR TABLES\n\nTIGRAY ZONES TOTAL UNDER 5 5 TO 17 18 TO 64 65 PLUS\n\nCentral 1,481,017 198,013 557,842 648,315 76,840\n\nEastern 1,048,223 138,524 392,018 463,852 53,827\n\nMekele 520,930 61,155 181,638 254,185 23,952\n\nNorth Western 923,343 123,489 347,905 404,010 47,938\n\nSouthern 793,136 105,211 297,304 349,773 40,843\n\nWestern 467,890 61,853 174,991 207,073 23,972\n\nSouth Eastern 451,059 61,721 172,310 193,130 23,901\n\nTotal 5,685,602 749,966 2,124,008 2,520,338 291,273\n\nSource: OCHA, accessed 03/02/2021\n\n2 2\n\n*includes: Qimant, **Includes Kunama, Oromo, Somali and other\n\n*** includes Oromo, Qimant, Awngi and other\n\n2 3\n\nTable 11 - Religion in Tigray and Ethiopia\n\nRELIGION TIGRAY ETHIOPIA TOTAL Orthodox Christians 92.2% 41.9%\n\nMuslim 1.7% 29.1%\n\nCatholic 2.1% 1.0%\n\nProtestant 0.0% 21.2%\n\nOthers 4.0% 6.8% Source: CSA 12/2020\n\nTable 12 - Gender indicators for Tigray and Ethiopia, 2016\n\nINDICATOR TIGRAY NATIONAL\n\nLITERACY AND EDUCATION\n\nFemale literacy (ages 15-49) 51% 42%\n\nMale literacy (ages 15-49) 79.9% 68.6%\n\nWomen who have obtained more than secondary education 2.7% 2.4%\n\nMen who had obtained more than secondary education 5.1% 5.3%\n\nMARRIAGE, FERTILITY AND EMPLOYMENT Median age of first marriage for women (ages 20-49) 17.2 years 17.5 years Fertility rate 4.7 4.6\n\nContraceptive prevalence 35% 35%\n\nFemale unemployment (2013) 7.7% 6.5%\n\nProportion of female teachers 47.5% 39.8%\n\nFemale headed households 34% 25%\n\nSource: Alive&Thrive 2018;

Due to sparse population, land holdings tend to be large, which allows for own food production with even very poor households being able to meet almost half of their food needs through food production. In highlands, teffand wheat is cultivated. Small-scale livestock production. Crops entirely dependent on kremti (June-September) rains. Market access is good in the lowlands and more challenging in highlands due to the topography. Although the zone only has one rainy season, it has the highest annual rainfall average in comparison to other zones in Tigray. HSS - Humera Sesame and Sorghum\n\nKremti (July-September)\n\nWSE - Western Cereal and Sesame Kremti (June-September).\n\nNorth Western zone In densely populated midlands, towns create income-generating opportunities, for example in construction; however, arable and grazing land is limited, reducing ability of households to meet their food needs. In lowlands, sorgum, millet, teff, maize, and sesame are cultivated, attracting seasonal labourers. Traditional gold mining especially in Mereb Basin along the border with Eritrea. Honey is cultivated in some areas. In addition to kremti rains, some areas receive asmera scattering rains (March-May). Generally good market access, though especially in MTK zone in the south, majority of roads are dirt roads, creating challenges during wet season. ALL - Adiyabo Lowland Kremti (June-September). MRB - Mereb Basin Kremti (June-September), asmera scattering rains (March-May) WCT - West Central TeffKremti (June-September), asmera scattering rains (March-May)\n\nMTK - Middle Tekeze Kremti (June-September), asmera scattering rains (March-May)\n\nCentral zone Crop production and livestock sales are important sources of income. Main crops are sorghum, finger millet, wheat, teff, and maize. A small gesho-producing livelihood zone straddles central and eastern administrative zones. Migratory labour to western Tigray is common and crucial for many households to generate additional income, as is construction labour in major towns. Some areas also offer local agricultural labour opportunities. High population density in some areas limit the size of land plots households can use for own food production, increasing dependency on food purchases and therefore vulnerability to price fluctuations, especially for poorer households. In Mereb Basin along the border with Eritrea, and some villages in other areas, artisanal gold mining is practiced.

Livestock herds are small due to insufficient grazing land, and labour migration abroad is common. In these areas, wild cactus presents an important source of food. In the more densely populated centre and south of the zone, deforestation and soil degradation are challenges for crop cultivation, with livestock sales and local agricultural labour being important sources of income. In the highlands, sale of eucalyptus trees is common. Most common crops in Eastern zone are barley and wheat, with teff, maize, and peas cultivated in specific sub-regions. Market accessibility is poor in remote and mountainous areas, but much better in areas closer to Mekele. IRM - Irob Mountains Kremti (June-August) EPL - Eastern Plateau Kremti (June-September). AWH - Atsbi Womberta Highland Kremti (June-September).\n\nEDM - Enderta Dry Midland Kremti (June-September). Asmera rains (March-May) are infrequent.\n\nSouth Eastern zone, Mekele Mekele is located in this zone, providing market access and casual wage labour opportunities. Barley, wheat, teff, and pulses are cultivated, though soil fertility is an issue. Livestock production is another key livelihood, less so for poorer households. There is some labour migration to western Tigray and Afar region. The lowlands in the south of the zone are characterized by cultivation of teff, sorghum, and maize, and livestock production, with some wealthier households also selling honey. EDM - Enderta Dry Midland Kremti (June-September). Asmera rains (March-May) are infrequent.\n\nSouthern zone The Southern zone largely consists of two lowlands separated by a mountainous highland area. The Raya Valley lowlands, bordering Afar region, have fertile soil, good market access, and decent rainfall, and produce a significant surplus of crops (mainly sorghum and teff), enabling even poorer households to cover most cereal needs through own production. Poorer households seasonally work in local agricultural labour on larger land holdings, while wealthier households also sell chat. In the highland areas, wheat, barley, and pulses are cultivated, with households also selling eucalyptus. The lowland zone bordering Amhara is less connected to local markets due to poor road infrastructure with many roads being dirt roads. Soils in this zone are degraded. Sorghum, wheat, barley, and teffare cultivated and wealthier households sell honey. Poor households cannot meet food needs through food production and rely on food purchases. Labour opportunities in the zone are limited, so labour migration to Raya Valley, western Tigray, Mekele, and Addis Ababa is common. Livestock sales are a source of income in all three zones.
