They are not an academic exercise to make your work more difficult, but instead, a tool to improve the design, implementation and assessment of your programs.\n\nThis guide is to help you understand and use theories of change and to provide you with resources and information that you can draw upon in that process. It distills insights from development policy and practice, as well as from the analysis of researchers, to give you the most up-to-date material to construct theories of change for development programming.\n\nThis Briefing Paper will cover the following:\n\n1. Defining theories of change and how they are relevant (Section 1.1) 2. Constructing theories of change (Section 1.2) 3. Introducing and explaining how to use the Theories of Change Matrix and Primers in defining your programmatic theories of change (Section 2.1) 4. Presenting the Theories of Change Matrix (Section 2.2)\n\n1.1 DEFINING THEORIES OF CHANGE AND THEIR RELEVANCE\n\nAs a development practitioner, the programs you design are intended to improve the conditions (economic, political, social, environmental, etc.) in a given context. As such, they will hopefully change how institutions operate/are structured and the way people think or act such that these improvements take place and are sustained. As a practitioner, you draw upon your experience and others' to create ways to catalyze or facilitate such changes. In doing so, you are making explicit, or sometimes implicit, assumptions about how the change will come about, i.e., which activities will function in which ways to create the desired outcome.\n\n\"A theory of change explains why we think certain actions will produce desired change in a given context.\"1 It is intended to make all of our implicit assumptions more explicit, in order to (1) clarify which drivers of violent conflict we are addressing; (2) state clearly what the intended outcome of programs will be; and (3) fully articulate how and why the program will address the drivers of conflict and achieve its intended outcomes.\n\nIn its simplest form, a theory of change is expressed in the following form:\n\n\"If we do X (action), then we will produce Y (change/shift towards peace, stability, security).\"\n\nCDA Collaborative Learning Projects, Search for Common Ground and CARE International (Forthcoming) Practical Approaches to Theories of Change in Conflict, Justice and Security Programmes (Draft, June 2012), London: DFID (\"DFID Theories of Change\"). 1\n\nI. Overview: Working with Theories of Change or\n\n\"We believe that by doing X (action) successfully, Y will come about (movement towards a desired goal).\"\n\nOf course, not all situations call for such simple statements. A theory of change might be expressed as, \"If we do X, Y and Z, it will lead to W,\" or, \"If we do X, it will lead to Y, which will lead to Z, which might possibly lead to W.\"\n\nIt is important to extend the statement a bit further to clarify underlying assumptions by adding the rationale or logic-how and why the change will come about-in a \"because\" phrase. This then produces the following:\n\n\"If we do X..., then Y..., because Z....\"\n\nFor instance, one theory of change for a post-war program aimed at promoting employment for ex-combatant youth might be as follows:\n\n\"If we provide employment for ex-combatant youth, then we will reduce the likelihood of inter-communal violence, because unemployed youths are the most likely to be recruited into fighting; many still hold weapons and remain connected to their command structures. If they find employment, they will disengage from their command structures and will be less recruitable because they will have more to lose.\" 2\n\nHow does a theory of change relate to a conflict analysis? 3\n\nConflict analysis and theories of change are related but distinct concepts used to inform conflict program interventions and their evaluation. Analysis that presents no avenues for change is not useful to development practitioners, while a theory of change not rooted in analysis is also unlikely to be effective.\n\nExperience has shown that analysis of the conflict dynamics and context is an essential first step to any and all program design, monitoring and evaluation in conflict-affected and fragile environments. At USAID, a formal conflict assessment process often serves as the starting point for programming-oriented analysis, although frequently it is necessary to conduct additional analysis specific to the project or activity in question.\n\nConflict analysis and assessment set the stage for design, monitoring and evaluation of programs by identifying the factors or drivers that are most salient in affecting dynamics of peace, conflict and fragility. By changing these factors or their interrelationships, it is logical to infer that conflict dynamics should change as a result. This is the juncture where theory of change and conflict analysis meet. The theory of change provides the bridge between analysis and programming, helping practitioners to make sure that the programs are relevant and appropriate to the conflict.\n\nIn short, based upon the findings of the conflict analysis, a theory of change can be identified by asking the question, \"What needs to change in this particular context to generate more peace and less violent conflict?\" The theory of change will be an \"if...then\" statement about how that Modified from \"DFID Theories of Change.\" 3 Modified from \"DFID Theories of Change.\" 2 change will happen. It will specify the type of change (e.g., knowledge, attitudes, skills, policies, etc.) and the target of change (e.g., key individual, group, organization, process, etc.), and the pathway to change (e.g., logic of results), ensuring that the theory of change is causally linked to the conflict diagnosis.\n\nHow can you use theories of change?\n\nThere are several ways in which theories of change are useful in conflict and development programming, some of which have already been mentioned:\n\n1. To make assumptions explicit about what change we expect to take place and how/why we expect this to happen. 2. To weed out unrealistic program ideas and clarify and refine ideas that are worthy of further consideration.4 3. To uncover gaps in our programming when we find that there are steps in the logic of our theories (see (1) above) that turn out to be either incorrect or missing entirely. 4. To make sure everyone involved in designing and implementing the program has the same understanding of why a program is structured as it is and how to implement it according to that structure. 5. To help communicate and be more transparent with beneficiaries and communities about programs. 6. To provide a basis for assessing relevance, effectiveness and impact in monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and, therefore, to help identify reasons for success or failure. 7. To identify where adjustments or modifications in the program may be needed to achieve the desired outcome/result. 8. Based on (6), to contribute to knowledge about violence, peace and development.5\n\nWhy is stating an explicit theory of change essential for effective monitoring and evaluation of conflict programs? 6\n\nWhen analysis, theory of change and implementation come together effectively, the result should be a noticeable change in the conflict dynamics. Focusing on these outcomes- particularly in the context of evaluation-is critical for purposes of accountability and learning. If a project does not appear to affect the overall conflict dynamics, however, there are four broadly plausible explanations:\n\n1. The underlying analysis was incorrect. Perhaps the project did affect identified conflict factors, but these factors were not related to the overall conflict dynamics in the manner previously See CAF 2.0, p. 36. 5 See OECD DAC (2012) Evaluating Peacebuiding Activities in Settings of Conflict and Fragility: Improving Learning for Results. Paris: OECD DAC. This Guidance emphasizes that \"[d]eveloping better founded, more clearly stated theories about how peacebuilding and statebuilding can be achieved and supported is a key message from this guidance for decision makers, managers, and programme staff.\" Id. at 9 (Executive Summary). 6 Ibid. 4\n\nEmbedding theory of change in context A theory of change cannot stand alone. It needs to be embedded and considered within a specific context. Efforts that contribute to a desired change in one context may have a different effect in another. understood; for example, the project addressed the symptoms of conflict instead of its sources. 2. The theory of change was unfounded or invalid. The expected changes did not take place because the project made incorrect assumptions about how change would occur in this context. Or perhaps the project did affect the targets of its change as intended, but the expected changes from this particular set of actions did not address drivers of conflict or had unintended negative consequences; for example, the project brought together leaders from opposing sides to pursue common goals unrelated to the peace process, and although relationships improved, attitudes about the other and about the peace process did not. 3. The project was not implemented properly. Perhaps the project did have a valid theory of change for affecting the conflict dynamics and the proposed actions would have yielded the desired outcomes, but the project did not go offas planned; for example, the project faced logistical challenges or malfeasance.\n\n4. The theory of change was valid but insufficient. The project's theory of change was valid and did affect the identified conflict factors, but it was insufficient to affect overall dynamics of peace and conflict. This, for example, could be due to the influence of other conflict factors that were not considered or addressed or to the absence of linkages with other programs.\n\nTheories of change, it should be added, may also benefit project managers in terms of maintaining accountability. In some cases, expectations for peace and security programs exceed what is plausible or realistic. By rooting projects in realistic and logical analysis and theories of change, project managers can ensure that the project's expectations are realistic and better respond to critiques, i.e., \"Perhaps the project did not bring about an end to the war, but there is credible evidence that it changed the dynamics in a positive way, based on the analysis and theory of change.\" A well thought-out theory of change will help identify and assess the nature of the contribution to the broader peace, rather than make inappropriate claims to have singlehandedly created that peace.\n\nIdentifying program gaps using theories of change: Liberia In the wake of the 14-year civil war in Liberia, a large international Non-Government Organization (NGO) received donor funding to develop Community Peace Councils (CPCs), a community-based mechanism for resolving a range of disputes, with an explicitly interethnic approach. One of the program's theories of change was if a new community-level mechanism for handling a range of dispute types was established, then it would help maintain peace in the community and avoid incidents that have the potential for escalating into serious violence. An evaluation team found that while the CPCs successfully handled many conflicts at the local level, they were, for the most part, not handling the most serious and volatile disputes relating to land issues. The team then explored whether this was due to a failure in program implementation or, alternatively, to a theory of change that was incomplete or inaccurate. The main conclusion was that, while the CPCs were set up and trained well, the CPCs mostly were excluded from handling land issues as communities were repopulated and traditional leadership patterns re-established. The program had made incorrect assumptions about how it would contribute to stopping key drivers of the conflict in Liberia, and subsequently adjusted its strategy.\n\n1.2 STEPS IN CONSTRUCTING A THEORY OF CHANGE\n\nThe theory of change is best articulated at the beginning of a planning process and reviewed and checked throughout the program cycle. However, it is also possible to develop or amend a theory of change at a later stage. Conflict situations tend to be volatile and dynamic in nature. A project must sometimes shift its focus or strategy to remain relevant to the situation on the ground. Or a project team might discover that the theory of change was insufficient or inadequate as the team learns more about the situation and the program's effects on it during implementation. In that case, it will be important to adopt a revised theory or theories of change as well. Unfortunately, this ideal is not always reflected in practice. Many efforts fail to develop theories of change at the beginning of the project cycle, if at all, and many others neglect the ongoing process of adaptation. However, it is never too late to develop a theory of change; it can be useful during all stages of the programming cycle.\n\nArticulating the theory(ies) of change is a helpful way of generating good logical frameworks. The logical or results framework establishes a hierarchy of objectives or results statements to show how a program believes change will come about. Essentially, a good and robust logical framework should represent \"a theory about how intended change will occur.\"7 Once the theory of change is developed, you can use it to identify what the project goal, purposes or intermediate results (IRs) and outputs for the logical framework are, as well as what you think needs to happen to achieve them.\n\nThe theory(ies) of change, which may not be written fully into the results framework or logical framework, are important because they clarify what is behind the arrows or links between different levels of objectives. They explain how and why achieving lower level results will lead to the higher level objectives and to the Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) goal, and thus help program planners identify and test critical assumptions and expectations about how the program will work.8\n\nStep 1: Conduct a conflict analysis\n\nAs with constructing any intervention, the first step is to conduct a conflict analysis to determine the significant drivers of violent conflict and sources of resilience in a given community, region or country. The conflict analysis should help focus attention for strategy and programming based on conflict drivers and mitigating factors, urgency, opportunity and needs. The revised USAID Conflict Assessment Framework (CAF 2.0) provides a template for conducting a conflict analysis. However, it is also possible to draw upon assessments done by other groups, such as the International Crisis Group, the United Nations, other donors or practitioners or USAID's own partners in the country concerned.\n\nUSAID (2010) Performance Monitoring and Evaluation TIPS No. 13: Building a Results Framework, 2nd Draft, Washington, DC: USAID. Available at pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnadw113.pdf. 8 See Levine, C. (2007) Catholic Relief Services' (CRS) Guidance for Developing Logical and Results Frameworks, Baltimore, MD: CRS. Available at http://dmeforpeace.org/learn/catholic-relief-services-guidance-developing-logical-and-results-frameworks. 7\n\nStep 2: Identify the conflict/resilience drivers the program will address\n\nOnce the significant causes of violent conflict and the sources of resilience are identified and prioritized in terms of their relative importance, the second step is for you to decide which of the priority conflict drivers you will try to address and which sources of resilience you will incorporate and build upon. This may be a function of mandate, expertise, staffing capacity, alignment with country strategy or availability of funding.\n\nStep 3: Identify the program's goals (the WHAT and the WHO)\n\nOnce a priority program area has been chosen, you must again consult the conflict assessment data to determine what type of change is desirable in this context. Here is where it is important to decide: (a) what the preferred outcome will be, once the change process is completed; and (b) whether the change process needs to target political leaders, institutions, civil society leaders and/or public opinion.\n\nStep 4: Develop the approach (the HOW)\n\nWhen the outcome(s) and target audience for the change process are decided, consider various approaches that could be employed to create the desired outcome. For example, if you identify that reducing hostility among youth is your goal (e.g., because youth interactions have been a significant trigger for conflict), you will want to consider a number of different approaches to achieving that goal, such as: cross-group sports and drama, cooperation on issues of common concern, media programming, tolerance education in schools, joint rewriting of history textbooks, youth camps, etc. Based on the conflict analysis, you then choose the most appropriate approach to use to achieve the change.\n\nNOTE: Individual projects are usually part of a continuum or chain of intended outcomes, which starts with current conditions and extends to the overall intention/vision of \"Peace Writ Large.\" 9 Project or program goals are incremental or intermediate outcomes along the way to this larger vision.\n\n\"Peace Writ Large\" is the term coined by the CDA Collaborative Learning Projects, in their study of peacebuilding activities. It refers to the ultimate goal of achieving sustainable peace in a community/ country/geographic region. The problem CDA found when it looked at most peacebuilding activities was that few of the implementers had thought about how their programs would/could eventually lead to this ultimate goal. Anderson, M., and L. Olson (2003) Confronting War: Critical Lessons for Peace Practitioners. Cambridge, MA: CDA Collaborative Learning Projects. 9\n\nTips on formulating robust goals Goals are often expressed in broad and vague terms, such as \"reconciliation,\" \"tolerance,\" \"empowerment\" or in overly specific terms of activities. This can make it difficult to develop a good theory of change. Goals should be articulated concretely as desired changes in the key drivers of the situation-observable changes in behavior, interactions, institutional performance, intergroup relations, norms, etc. For example, goals that \"women are raising issues of concern to them with local authorities, leading to changes in government policies\" or that \"women are consulted and included in the peace process\" are more specific goals than \"women are empowered to participate in the peace process.\" Those goals would also be a good reformulation of activitybased goals, such as \"1500 women will be trained in peacebuilding and advocacy.\"\n\nHere is where it might be especially helpful to consult the Theories and Indicators of Change (THINC) Matrix (see Section 2.2 of this document). The THINC Matrix can be a tool to help you brainstorm or focus. You may also want to review the Primers for other ideas about how to best achieve your goal. They provide an overview of various approaches, as identified in practice and through comparative and case study research, and the intended outcomes when using each one. This will give you a general idea or set of ideas that you should adapt to your context.\n\nStep 4: Articulate the theory(ies) of change\n\nWrite up the completed \"theory of change\" to be employed, taking care to specify in detail what your assumptions are about and how your approach will result in your expected outcome in this specific context. Referring to the diagram (Figure 1), the \"Project Logic\" should be spelled out clearly in order to articulate how the project activities will add up to the project's goal or IR. The \"Overall Theory of Change\" should also be articulated. This makes clear how achieving the goal or outcome of the program will ultimately lead to a Development Objective (DO) that is tied to an over-arching development or peacebuilding goal like the CDCS or Peace Writ Large and will address the drivers of conflict or sources of resilience you have identified in the conflict analysis.\n\nFor example, suppose you are developing a program to treat children in schools for trauma and train them in skills for non-violent conflict resolution. The desired outcome of the program is less violence between children of differing religious groups in a local school. The overall theory of change might be articulated by considering how, if your program is successful, it will contribute to mitigating or transforming the drivers of conflict or strengthening sources of resilience you have identified in the conflict analysis. The programmatic theory of change (or program logic) might be constructed by developing a continuum of results (a hierarchy or sequence of changes sought through the program logic) by: identifying all the activities and changes resulting from them, from outputs to outcomes and impacts; organizing them in a logical sequence; and identifying the theories of change associated with each one, as illustrated in Table 1.\n\nPut together as a narrative, the theory of change of this program might read as follows:\n\nThis program is based upon the premise that if children in this school are given individual treatment for trauma recovery, then they will develop increased ability to control their emotions and not act out against others, especially those who are different from them. This is because the activities will have helped them begin to heal from the psychological wounds of war and reduce their overall fear and sense of vulnerability at school. Under these conditions, if we introduce inter-group skills (negotiation, mediation, problem-solving) to children of different religious groups together, then they will be able to learn them and use them to resolve disputes at school, including those that may arise between religious groups. Reduction of violence in schools will contribute to reduction of inter-religious violence overall because youth are recruited by extremist groups who are significant perpetrators of inter-religious violence and because schools are a significant place for violence in this region. The children will also be more likely to use the skills outside of school, and will be less recruitable by such extremist groups.\n\nStep 5: Assess the theory(ies) of change\n\nWhen the complete theory has been developed in a hierarchy of results and/or narrative story, the team must assess whether there are: (a) gaps in the logic of how the steps in the process follow from each other; (b) assumptions that cannot be supported; or (c) steps in the chain that cannot be carried out for any reasons. If any of these make the desired outcome no longer feasible, the team must go back to Step 3 to begin the theory of change analysis with another possible target audience or approach. For instance, in the example above, you might test how realistic the assumption is that children will be able to use the new skills outside of school and whether the ability to resolve conflicts peacefully will be enough to lead them to resist recruitment to violence (i.e., are there other factors?). Similarly, the assumption that children are \"acting out\" only because of the trauma they experienced might also be tested.\n\nA number of frameworks exist for assessing the theory of change. Table 2 below describes the qualities of a good theory of change and some practical tips for developing them in the context of a specific program. guidance on learning and evidence.\n\nBe sure to share your evaluation reports with DCHA/CMM and PPL/LER to ensure continued learning.\n\nPlausibility: Beliefs and assumptions about how one change will influence another have been explored and articulated and there has been some challenge of \"comfort zones\" in thinking them through.\n\nState assumptions in the results framework and in the project appraisal document.\n\nConsider undertaking a systems analysis or generating a systems map; See Systems Thinking in Conflict Assessment: Application and Concepts (2012) from CMM.\n\nGrounded in context: It takes context as the starting point and reflects the reality of change processes in that setting.\n\nReview any recent conflict assessments, DRG assessments, political economy analysis, gender analysis or related CDCS background information. DCHA/CMM can provide recommendations on sources for high-quality conflict analysis.\n\nTestable: It is specific enough to be tested for validity over time.\n\nAsk, \"What would show this theory is not right or this program is not working? What would falsify it?\" Build this into the evaluation design and the project appraisal document. For guidance on evaluation design and management, contact DCHA/CMM or PPL/LER.\n\nInclude processes for monitoring validity of theories of change in M&E plan.\n\nDynamic: Uncertainties, risks and knock-on effects are captured, including unintended negative and positive effects and a process is in place for reviewing and revising the theory.\n\nDocument uncertainties and risks in the SOW; include scope for flexibility, such as a \"crisis modifier.\" Build a process for strategic theory review and revision into the SOW and/or annual work plan.\n\nWhat about when a theory of change needs to be evaluated against a larger objective (contribution to the larger societal peace) or against other theories of change, such as in the context of a country strategy (i.e., CDCS)? The CAF 2.0 suggests using the Reflecting on Peace Practice (RPP) Matrix as a way to identify gaps in the theory of change as well as potential linkages with other programs that can enhance the effectiveness of USAID programming.10 The RPP Matrix can help in assessing and strengthening both the coherence and plausibility of a theory of change in context. The RPP Matrix emerged from research by the RPP Program of CDA Collaborative Learning Projects. It summarizes the major findings of RPP, illustrating that effective peacebuilding efforts link change at the individual/personal level (e.g., attitudes, skills, relationships) to change at the socio-political level. They also link change in \"key people\" or mobilizers to change in \"more people\" or society at large.11\n\nIn brief, if a program works primarily at the individual/personal level-on attitudes, skills and relationships-and the practitioners merely \"hope\" that the outcomes at that level will lead to changes in the socio-political realm, then a review or revision of Steps 3 and 4 might be needed CAF 2.0, Section 4.1. 11 Anderson, M., and L. Olson (2003) Confronting War: Critical Lessons for Peace Practitioners. Cambridge, MA: CDA Collaborative Learning Projects. See also CAF 2.0, Section 4.1. 10 to fill in gaps or to identify linkages with other efforts that might strengthen the program's effectiveness. Similarly, if a program working with \"more people\" does not link to \"key people\" or mobilizers in some way (and vice versa), then a gap exists and should be addressed.\n\nStep 6: Monitor and Evaluate Outcomes and Impacts\n\nContext matters! Not all theories of change will be effective or even possible to use under all circumstances. Often, changes in context, new understandings of the dynamics a program is trying to influence and changes in implementation realities can affect the relevance and validity of the theory of change in the context. Therefore, MONITORING AND EVALUATING OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS IS CRUCIAL, so that assumptions are continuously examined and programs can be adjusted accordingly. You should regularly review whether the results at the lower levels are leading to the results at higher levels. The results hierarchy and underlying theories of change must be regularly revised to remain clear, coherent and relevant to the current context. It is also important to review the program's activities and results with another evaluative method. This will help you assess the intended intervention and the results together.\n\nOnce you have articulated, tested and refined the theory of change, you can develop indicators to monitor your assumptions, outputs, outcomes and sustainability in comparison with expectations informed by the design of the program. By breaking down the statements of the \"if\" (input), \"then\" (outputs and outcomes) and \"because\" (assumptions, logic), the theory of change can help you identify good indicators for activities/outputs, the expected changes resulting from each of the activities and the assumptions underlying the theories.12\n\nFor further guidance on developing indicators, see USAID's guidance on performance monitoring, \"Selecting Performance Indicators\" (2010) TIPS No. 6 (2nd edition), available at http://transition.usaid.gov/policy/evalweb/documents/TIPSSelectingPerformanceIndicators.pdf and http://www.usaid.gov/results-and-data/information-resources/program-evaluations. USAID staff can also draw on a range of internal resources on this topic on ProgramNet at https://programnet.usaid.gov/. For further guidance on using theories of change in monitoring and evaluation, see CARE International UK (2012) Guidance for Designing, Monitoring and Evaluating Peacebuilding Projects using Theories of Change, London: CARE International UK, and Corlazzoli, V. and J. White (forthcoming 2013) \"Practical Approaches to Theories of Change in Conflict, Security and Justice Programmes: Part II: Using Theories of Change in Monitoring and Evaluation.\" London: DFID. 12\n\nUsing Theories of Change to Create Indicators in School Trauma Healing Program In the trauma healing program for school children described in Step 5, an indicator that the project's goal has been achieved could be the number of inter-religious conflict incidents at school in a month.\n\nIndicators could also be developed to assess whether the project is having the impact the theory of change anticipates-to reduce recruitment of school-age youth into armed groups. These could include the number of school-age youth associated with armed groups outside of school or the number of youth-perpetrated incidents of inter-religious violence.\n\nFinally, you can use the theory of change to develop indicators to monitor progress towards the goal and to monitor the assumptions underpinning the theory of change. For example, the theory of change assumes that if children are trained in conflict resolution skills, they will use the skills to resolve conflicts at school non-violently. Several assumptions about the impact of training underpin this theory: 1) that training is relevant and an effective mechanism for knowledge and skill transfer; 2) that information and skills are understood and accepted as an alternative to violence;1 Indicators for these assumptions might be:\n\n• % of participating youth who demonstrate knowledge and skill acquisition and comprehension in pre/post-test;\n\n• % of surveyed youth who state they are confident in their ability to employ nonviolent conflict resolution techniques.\n\n2.1 INTRODUCING THE THINC MATRIX AND PRIMERS This section provides you with resources for developing your theories of change. It describes the most commonly used theories of change in conflict management and mitigation, and it supplies you with supporting information and references to understand the state-of-the-art research backing (or raising questions about) each theory.\n\nWhat is the THINC Matrix?\n\nThe Theories and Indicators of Change (THINC) Matrix summarizes and organizes the major theories of change in the practice of conflict management and mitigation, including conflict resolution. It was developed by DCHA/CMM and its partners based upon extensive literature review and consultation with experts and practitioners. The THINC Matrix is one way of organizing the many theories of change that have informed peacebuilding projects, programs and strategies.\n\nThe families and individual theories in the Matrix have been categorized based on their shared assumptions and qualities to provide a comprehensive but manageable list useful to program planners and managers. However, the list should not be considered exhaustive. Many initiatives have their own theory of change, multiple theories of change or combined aspects of different theories. And most initiatives in complex and fragile environments need and have more complex theories than simple \"if...then...because\" statements (for example, \"if we do x, y and z, then this will lead to A, which will promote B and possibly lead to C, because...\"). What is important is to be able to articulate the thinking about how change happens.\n\nWhat are the THINC Primers?\n\nThe THINC Primers (published separately) give program planners and managers a detailed summary of the theories of change identified and critiqued through the THINC initiative and summarized in the THINC Matrix. They are meant to provide a brief introduction to the current practice and research underpinning each theory and its family and to point the reader to resources that can be accessed in order to learn more about the strengths and weaknesses of each theory.\n\nThe Primers are organized according to the families of Theories of Change listed in the THINC Matrix: Attitudes, Behaviors and Institutions. Each Primer includes:\n\n1. An overview presenting the entire family and its core assumptions. 2. Summaries of each theory of change within the family describing each theory and its core change logic.\n\n2. Common Theories of Change in Conflict Management and Mitigation: Matrix and Primers Steps in Constructing a Theory of Change 1. Conduct a conflict analysis. 2. Identify the conflict/resilience drivers the program will address. 3. Identify the goals of the program. 4. Develop the approach. 5. Articulate the theory(ies) of change. 6. Assess the theory(ies) of change. 7. Monitor and evaluate outcomes and impacts.\n\n3. Examples of programs that are grounded in each theory of change. The examples provided in the Primers are NOT meant to be endorsements for any particular theory, but rather illustrations of how various theories have been implemented. When data is available to indicate whether, or under what circumstances, a particular theory of change has been successful, that will be indicated. However, such data is not available for all theories of change. 4. Overviews of debates and critiques concerning the validity and application of each theory, based on academic research and practitioner and policy experience. 5. Resources to offer practitioners, additional material on the theories of change, their application and their validity in different contexts.\n\nHow can you use the THINC Matrix and Primers?\n\nThe THINC Matrix and Primers are designed to be used at all stages of the program cycle: analysis, design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. However, the Matrix and Primers will be most useful in the design, monitoring and evaluation phases, since these are the points when you first attempt to articulate a clear, coherent, grounded theory of change and later seek to assess progress against that theory.\n\nIn other words, although potentially of use throughout these steps and the program cycle, the THINC Matrix and Primers can be particularly useful in informing steps #4, #5 and #6 in the sequence for constructing and using a theory of change.\n\nYou can use the THINC Matrix and Primers to:\n\n• Generate new program ideas-read through the materials to inform brainstorming about what theories and kinds of programs would be appropriate and effective in the particular context. (It should, however, only be a starting point-the ideas and the theories behind them need to be developed and thought through in context.) • Express ideas-find language and information to help you express a difficult or new idea, i.e., articulate the theory of change underlying your program or when you are trying to infer a theory of change from a project already underway where the theory of change was not clearly expressed at the beginning. • Clarify and seek consensus on program logic-identify, choose and develop consensus on what changes particular activities or approaches you may be pursuing will catalyze and why and how those changes may come about, especially when activities can fit into many different theories of change. • Refine and test ideas-use the process of articulating the theory of change or the underlying research in the primers to critically examine your idea and the assumptions underlying it in light of scholarship. • Compare ideas-understand how different theories of change relate to one another and to the underlying changes they seek to make.\n\nThe Matrix gives a brief description of each theory, the target audience(s) for each, and the basic assumptions that underlie the theory. This should give you a good idea of which ones may fit your program needs. There will most probably be a few choices, and the Primers will then be helpful in discerning whether and how a given theory may be valid or need to be adapted for a specific circumstance.\n\nHow should you NOT use the THINC Matrix and Primers?\n\nThe THINC Matrix is:\n\n• Not a stamp of approval-While the theories presented in the Matrix are common in practice or research, their validity has not necessarily been proven or supported by evidence, nor are they necessarily endorsed by USAID or the authors of this report. The Primers do provide examples of how the theory has been used in practice and summarize the debates about when and under what circumstances various theories may be valid. However, research is constantly evolving, and you will need to test and monitor whether the theory of change underlying your program is appropriate and valid in the context where you are working. • Not a checklist or menu-While the theories and information in the Matrix and Primers can help you brainstorm program ideas, they should not be used as a checklist or menu to pick from. The Matrix and Primers should not be a substitute for thinking through what theory or theories of change are appropriate for your program and context. • Not exhaustive-Just because an idea or theory is not in the list does not mean it is not credible; analysis may lead you to develop a new theory, but it should exhibit all of the qualities of a good theory of change outlined in the first section and, in particular, Table 2. • Not static-USAID anticipates updating this Matrix as new evidence emerges on the theories or as new policy and program guidelines are developed related to theories of change and project design/evaluation. Learning emerging from experience with and evaluations of the theories of change in your programs will add to the evidence that will be incorporated in the THINC Matrix. • Not the only aspect of effective project design-Formulating a theory of change is essential to effective conflict mitigation and development, but there are many other aspects that are important as well as related to management, logistics, contracting/grants, finances and personnel. Notably, projects and activities in conflict-affected and fragile environments need to adhere to principles of good engagement by ensuring activities do no harm, are not discriminatory, are flexible to shifting circumstances and so on.13\n\nHow can you enhance and build on the THINC Matrix?\n\nThe THINC Matrix represents an attempt to rationalize (and simplify) the field of conflict resolution and peacebuilding to facilitate better knowledge management by USAID and its partners. Building upon this knowledge management architecture through additional research, See OECD DAC (2007) \"Principles for Good International Engagement in Fragile States and Situations.\" Paris: OECD DAC. www.oecd.org/dac/incaf. 13 targeted information, and sharing of results and ideas organized in terms of this framework will lead to better outcomes for everyone.\n\nPractitioners can\n\n• Share information about appropriate indicators and evaluation techniques corresponding to specific theories or theory families; • Share best practices and lessons learned by theory; • Provide guidance on legal or operational dimensions for different theories (for example, which types of actors are most appropriate to which activities implied within the theory(ies)).\n\nResearchers can\n\n• Share research pertaining to theories or their underlying premises, leading over time to some theories on the Matrix being revised, supported or abandoned; • Investigate how different theories are related to one another (such as when one theory is strongly implied within another); • Critically examine or expose acknowledged or unspoken assumptions within each theory.\n\nUSAID's Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (DCHA/CMM) welcomes input on these or related efforts. Please send your feedback or supporting information to conflict@usaid.gov.\n\nConstruction of the THINC Matrix\n\nThe THINC Matrix summarizes the major theories of change commonly informing noncoercive conflict resolution practice-although it does not purport to include all possible theories. The theories have been grouped into families, according to the type of change that is being sought (i.e., the WHAT and the WHO in Section 1.2.3 above).\n\nThere are three such groupings, or families:\n\n• theories that seek change in attitudes; • theories that seek change in behaviors; • theories that seek change in institutions.\n\nThe families are not mutually exclusive; it is often possible and desirable to combine more than one theory of change in a program; i.e., to target attitudes and behaviors, or behaviors and institutions or all three.\n\nFamily #1-Attitudes Theories in this family are structured to change attitudes of individuals and groups. There are various attitudes that are correlated with politically violent or peaceful behaviors, and the underlying premise of the theories in this family is that by changing such attitudes, violent behavior will be prevented or mitigated because the thoughts/feelings that lead to such behavior will be changed or mitigated. A further assumption is that this creates more stable, constructive change in the society over the medium to long term because attitudes are more resilient than behaviors.\n\nThis Theory of Change Family encompasses a variety of theories about attitude change, including:\n\n• Intra-personal attitudes-change within individuals concerning their experience of the conflict and their ability to change their own attitudes about the effects of conflict. Theory 1.1 (Trauma Healing) focuses on such personal change. • Inter-group relationships and attitudes-group-level change in attitudes about the \"other\" and changes in relationships between conflicting groups. Theories 1.2 (Social/Cultural Contact), 1.3 (Cooperation and Mutual Interest) and 1.4 (Problem Solving Dialogue) describe different theories for decreasing negative attitudes about the \"other\" and building cross-conflict relationships. They describe individual-level change that is hoped to lead to change in group attitudes, as individuals change due to their encounters with the \"other,\" and then, in turn, begin to change the norms of their group or of other individuals. This, in turn, creates various individual-level change within the group. • Attitudes about the conflict-Theory 1.5 (Attitudes About Conflict) focuses on attitude changes within individuals or groups about the conflict itself: its nature, its consequences and the value of peace. • Public opinion and social norms about the \"other\" and about the conflict-cultural change, or changes in mass attitudes about the \"other,\" about peace and about values and norms such as tolerance, diversity, etc. Theories 1.6 (Mass Attitudes About Conflict) and 1.7 (Culture of Peace) focus on changing societal attitudes about the specific conflict or about ways of dealing with difference.\n\nTheories of change can focus on promoting change in key people (\"mobilizers\"),14 whether officials or not, or on broadening change to reach more people in the citizenry and communities to enhance their willingness and capacity to support peace.\n\nFamily #2-Behaviors\n\nTheories in this family share the assumption that behaviors can be changed directly, without requiring prior attitude change. The further assumption is that this creates change more quickly because it bypasses having to allow for the longer process of a shift in attitudes. Direct behavior change is accomplished by withholding or diminishing the resources key actors or mobilizers have to perpetrate violence (Theory 2.1), addressing security fears of key actors (Theory 2.2) or changing the incentives for actors in the conflict, making the actions that lead to violence more costly and those that lead to non-violent problem-solving more appealing (Theory 2.3). Behavior change can also be facilitated through management of domestic political obstacles to peace (Theory 2.4) and through building of skills and capacities that actors lack to engage in more productive processes of peacemaking, peacebuilding and cooperation (Theory 2.5).\n\nPrograms developed based on these theories often incorporate activities and processes that are designed to change attitudes or may follow on work that is focused on attitude change and relationship building. Many programs based on these theories espouse that attitude change is also important and useful for influencing conflict-related decisions and behaviors of actors; attitude change may indeed be one step in a strategy for producing behavior change, to See USAID, CAF 2.0, Section 3.1. 14 reinforce or sustain changes in behavior. However, the theories in this family do not assume that attitude change will automatically produce behavior change. Rather, changing behavior and decisions requires additional effort and approaches.\n\nFamily #3-Institutions\n\nThis Theory of Change family is fundamentally about structural change, as opposed to change at a group or individual level. Political and economic theory has long recognized that societies and groups have institutions, or rules, governing who has power and how that power may be used. The institutions of society are often themselves systems for resolving conflict, such as through the rule of law or social norms, but when they do not work as planned or when different sets of institutions clash, violence can escalate. The Institutions Theory of Change Family describes ways to change the capabilities and functioning of the institutions of a society, as well as how they are perceived by the public, in order to promote sustainable peace.\n\nThe core hypothesis for institutional theories of change is, if institutions in a society are effective and legitimate, then they create options for addressing grievances peacefully rather than through violent means. As evoked in this hypothesis, there are two major underlying qualities of institutions that are believed to promote peacebuilding: effectiveness (the extent to which institutions deliver public goods and services adequately) and legitimacy (the extent to which state-society interactions produce outcomes considered to be fair, inclusive and transparent).\n\nUsing Multiple Theories of Change to Address Conflict Issues\n\nMany theories of change are relevant and can be used in combination to address more complex issues that USAID identifies as important for transforming conflict dynamics and which fall within its manageable interests in a given context, such as: dealing with the past, support for peace processes, reconciliation or people-to-people programming. Reconciliation, for example, can be pursued through trauma healing (Theory 1.1), any of the inter-group dialogue theories (Theories 1.2-1.4) and institution-building theories (Family 3). Similarly, people-to-people programming can focus on social contact (Theory 1.2), problem-solving (Theory 1.4), psychological aspects of conflict (e.g., trauma, Theory 1.1) or skill building (Theory 2.5).\n\nExample: Dealing with the past\n\nMany of the theories of change that relate to attitudes can be used to address the past, often in multi-prong programs. The importance of creating mechanisms for dealing with the past is well documented, especially in situations where peace agreements do not address the key grievances of certain groups or negotiated commitments are not implemented in the postconflict environment. In cases where one party defeats the other through force and when \"groups remain intermixed after violence occurs, renewed violence is probably an even greater danger.\"15 Programs for dealing with the past can be based on a number of different theories, which might be adapted for the particular context and goals of the activities, for example:\n\nStaub, E. (2006) \"Reconciliation after Genocide, Mass Killing, or Intractable Conflict: Understanding the Roots of Violence, Psychological Recovery and Steps Towards a General Theory,\" Political Psychology, Vol. 27, No. 6, p 868. 15\n\n• Trauma Healing (Theory 1.1): If people address the trauma caused by their experience of violence, they will not have a desire for revenge, will be able to focus on the future and will have capacity to form relationships with former \"enemies.\" Sample activity: psychosocial counseling. • Inter-group Relationship-Building (Theories 1.2-1.4): If people are able to engage in structured inter-group dialogue, their pain and suffering will be heard and acknowledged. As a result, they will be able to acknowledge their own group's harmful actions.\"16 This exchange will allow them to feel closure and move on, breaking cycles of violence. Sample activity: dialogue workshops with community leaders and ex-combatants. • Public Opinion and Social Norms (Theory 1.7): If traumatic events of the past are commemorated, memorialized and acknowledged on a broad, public level within a society, then the norms governing intergroup relations will be more tolerant, and people in such societies will be encouraged and supported to coexist peacefully. Sample activities: collective rituals; community reconciliation ceremonies; reconciliation-focused radio programs.\n\nTo create a holistic and comprehensive approach to programming that effectively helps communities deal with the past, many programs have elements of all three of these theories of change. For example, one program in Rwanda worked with a range of actors in society, from members of the population who were affected in deeply personal ways by the conflict, to national leaders who shape policies, practices and institutions. The program's interventions have included training of the staff of NGOs that work with groups in the community; seminars/workshops with community leaders, journalists and national leaders (government ministers, heads of commissions, members of the supreme court and advisors to the President); and the development of nationally broadcast radio programs that, according to surveys conducted in the summer of 2005, reached 90% of the radio listening population.17\n\n2.2 CMM THEORIES OF CHANGE MATRIX\n\nThe Matrix is intended to be a summary of the major Theories of Change outlined in the section above. You can use this matrix as a quick reference as you are reflecting on your proposed approach, asking important questions such as, \"Is the theory appropriate for the goal?\"; \"Is the theory consistent with my underlying analysis?\"; and \"Is the logic sound?\"\n\nThe Matrix provides:\n\n1. The name of the theory (Column 1). 2. A concise statement of the theory of change (\"If...then\" statement, Column 2). 3. An indication of the constituency engaged (Column 3). This may be key people (groups who play a critical role in whether a conflict continues or not) or more people (groups and people in the broader population-such as communities, business people, religious leaders, women, youth, etc.) whose support and inclusion in the peacebuilding process is needed for peace to be achieved and sustained.\n\n4. A brief description of the theory and the assumptions underlying it (Column 4).\n\nId. p.887. 17 Ibid. 16\n\nTheory of Change (THINC) Matrix\n\nTheory of Change Statement\n\nConstituency Most Often\n\nEngaged\n\nDescription\n\nTheory of Change Family 1: Shifts in Attitudes\n\nTheories in this family seek to influence the attitudes and psychological drivers and effects of mass mobilization by key actors in an armed conflict.\n\nTheory 1.1: Trauma Healing If individuals who have been traumatized by violence are given opportunities and support, then their desire for revenge will be reduced. More People Theories of change related to psychosocial trauma healing emphasize processes that assist traumatized individuals to develop effective strategies for coping with the emotional, cognitive, behavioral and spiritual effects of trauma. They assume that the psychological impact of violence on victims, perpetrators and bystanders is a significant barrier to the reestablishment of relationships with former enemies.\n\nTheory 1.2: Social/Cultural Contact\n\nIf groups from conflicting societies participate in joint activities, then this contact will lead to increased understanding of the other and will reduce inter-group conflict. More People This theory is based on the assumption that contact based on cultural, social and recreational activities will promote increased understanding. Programs may include peace camps for youth, cultural exchanges and inter-ethnic sports games. The theory is that hostility between groups is perpetuated by unfamiliarity and separation and that inter-group contact can challenge negative stereotypes and generate more positive inter-group attitudes and relationships.\n\nTheory 1.3: Cooperation and Mutual Interest\n\nIf groups from similar sectors of conflicting societies work together on issues of mutual interest, then they will learn to cooperate, and through cooperation, develop increased trust and positive relations.\n\nMore People This theory is based on the assumption that if contact among people across conflict lines occurs in activities based on mutual interests, understanding will increase, prejudice will be reduced and a \"safe space within the conflict for healthy relationships to develop\" will be created.\n\nTheory 1.4: Problem Solving and Dialogue If people from both sides of a conflict engage in unofficial dialogue at the Track 2 and 3 levels, then these efforts will ultimately strengthen official negotiation processes. Key People and More People\n\nUnofficial, yet structured, interactions and sustained dialogue are expected to make possible a quality and depth of communication that is not possible in more official processes, and thereby generate new understandings of the conflict and the parties that facilitates resolution of conflict issues.\n\nTheory 1.5: Attitudes about Conflict If perceptions of the costs of violence or benefits of peace are changed, then key decision makers or broader constituencies will withdraw support (and mobilization) for violence.\n\nKey People and More People\n\nThis theory presumes that if individuals change their attitudes about the consequences of continuing conflict or the benefits of alternative means of addressing conflict, then they will pursue peaceful means of resolving or transforming conflict (e.g., peace agreements), and they will influence societal attitudes or mobilize in favor of peaceful resolution of the conflict.\n\nTheory 1.6. Mass Attitudes about Conflict\n\nIf enough people in society change their attitudes to favor peace, then they will prefer that key actors seek peaceful solutions to conflicts and will resist mobilization to violence. More People If key actors' attitudes change but the general population does not believe in peace, it can be difficult for key actors to create and maintain peace. In some contexts, such attitude changes can prepare the sides to accept an official peace. In others, it can be the basis for the creation of social movements at the grassroots levels of society to call for an end to violence.\n\nTheory 1.7: \"Culture of Peace\"\n\nIf societies focus resources on changing people's attitudes to support peaceful resolution of conflicts, then a culture of peace will emerge that promotes coexistence.\n\nMore People This theory focuses on fostering a cultural shift from violent (\"culture of war\") to peaceful approaches (\"culture of peace\") to handling conflict as a long-term process of transforming the attitudes and social norms that supported violent conflict in the past.\n\nTheory of Change Family 2: Changes in Behavior\n\nTheories in this family share the assumption that behaviors can be changed directly, without requiring attitude change.\n\nTheory 2.1: Changing Elite Means\n\nIf the means or resources that key actors have to pursue violence are reduced, then they will be less able to pursue violence and more amenable to negotiation and peaceful means of resolving conflict. Key People This theory grows out of work by Paul Collier and Anke Hoeffler on the economic causes of war. They suggested that rebellions start not because of grievances, but because of the \"greed\" of leaders seeking greater access to financial resources. In other words, whether or not \"greed\" or economic motivation is a factor, government leaders and rebel groups cannot wage war without access to the means to do so.\n\nTheory 2.2: Resolving the Security Dilemma If a party's fears that the \"other\" is not committed to peace and will exploit it in the future are allayed, then it will not resort to force. Key People This theory builds on research concerning the \"security dilemma,\" which arises when one party, in an effort to increase its own security, and out of distrust of the other side, decreases the other side's sense of security, e.g., by resorting prematurely to the use of force. Confidence-building measures, peacekeeping and verification missions, monitoring mechanisms and some problem-solving dialogues all seek to provide confidence that will alter a party's decision to escalate conflict.\n\nTheory 2.3: Incentives for Peace\n\nIf motivations or incentives for violence are changed so that violence seems more costly and non-violence more attractive, then people will pursue peace and reject violence.\n\nThis theory defines decision making as a matter of rational choice and focuses on changing behavior by changing the incentives facing decision makers, rather than the means at their disposal, by increasing negative incentives for violence or positive incentives for nonviolence and cooperation. If people have the right incentives, motives or choices so that they believe they are gaining more from non-violence than from war, then they will decide to end war and pursue peace.\n\nTheory 2.4: Addressing Domestic Divisions\n\nIf domestic political struggles within a party are addressed, resolved or managed, then a party will have greater motivation and capacity to pursue peace.\n\nPrograms based on this theory seek to address domestic divisions that limit leaders' ability to make decisions against continuing violence or to pursue peace. Intra-communal or \"single community\" programs that bring different factions within one side together for dialogue are an example.\n\nTheory 2.5: Improving Skills and Processes\n\nIf parties have skills and good processes for resolving conflicts, then they will be more successful in negotiating peace and dealing effectively with underlying causes of conflict. Key People The implicit assumption is that lack of capacity or inadequate process is a significant obstacle in negotiation, peacebuilding and consensus building. This theory suggests that if the parties have the proper skills and processes to handle the conflict differently, then agreements and cooperation are more likely.\n\nTheory of Change Family 3: Institutions\n\nTheories in this family apply if you are working in a situation in which formal and informal institutions lack the capability to respond to the needs of the population and/or are considered to be unfair, abusive or corrupt.\n\nTheory 3.1: Statebuilding Theory of Change If formal and informal institutions can efficiently and effectively respond to the needs of society, then people will rely on these institutions rather than resorting to violence.\n\nThis theory rests on the idea that members of society look to institutions, both formal and informal, to have sufficient capacity to efficiently and effectively provide goods and services to meet the range of needs in society (e.g., police, jobs). When these needs are not met, the likelihood of violence increases. The theory contends that people will be less likely to engage in destructive conflict against the government if it acts and is seen to act efficiently and effectively.\n\nTheory 3.2: Liberal Peace Theory of Change\n\nIf institutions are democratic, then people will more likely feel included and able to address grievances nonviolently, thereby promoting peace.\n\nUnder the Liberal Peace Theory of Change, the legitimacy of a state's institutions is determined by their democratic nature. Only democratic processes and institutions allow the people of a society to express their will and exert control over those making decisions in governing institutions. Under such a structure, people will be less likely to either revolt against the government or address their grievances violently, thereby creating a more peaceful nation.\n\nTheory 3.3: Traditional Institutions Theory of Change\n\nIf institutions in a society are based on traditional structures (not externallyimposed structures), then people will feel more allegiance to those institutions, reducing the likelihood that they will use violence to change the institutions.\n\nThe premise of this theory is that institutions should be based on traditional norms, customs and models particular to that community or nation. Such institutions are familiar to and reflect the values of the people they govern. As such, people are more likely to feel ownership over them and to respect them as legitimate, and thus be less likely to resort to violent means to reject or replace such institutions.\n\nTheory 3.4: Ad-hoc or Transitional Institutions Theory of Change If support is provided to temporary institutions that assist in the transition from a violent and/or insecure society to a peaceful society, then the likelihood of violence re-emerging in the future will be reduced.\n\nAd-hoc institutions provide a bridging function, which is both backwards and forwards looking. They are intended to help society deal with unresolved issues from the past, in order to move forward. The principle is that by facing the negative experiences of the past, those issues will not act as impediments to future progress.\n\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES General resources on theories of change Anderson, M., and L.
