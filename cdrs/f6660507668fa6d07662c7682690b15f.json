In many places, we still lack the ability to collect reliable and timely data to truly know the magnitude and severity of food crises gripping vulnerable populations. And the upheaval that has been set in motion by the COVID-19 pandemic may push even more families and communities into deeper distress.\n\nAt this time of immense global challenges, from conflicts to climate shocks to economic instability, we must redouble our efforts to defeat hunger and malnutrition. This is crucial for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and building a more stable and resilient world.\n\nWe have the tools and the know-how. What we need is political will and sustained commitment by leaders and nations.

This increase also reflected the inclusion of additional countries and areas within some countries.\n\nWhen comparing the 50 countries that were in both the 2019 and the 2020 reports, the population in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) rose from 112 to 123 million. This reflected worsening acute food insecurity in key conflict-driven crises, notably the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan and the growing severity of drought and economic shocks as drivers in countries such as Haiti, Pakistan and Zimbabwe.\n\nAround 183 million people in 47 countries were classified in Stressed (IPC/CH Phase 2) conditions, at risk of slipping into Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) if confronted by an additional shock or stressor.\n\nSource: FSIN, GRFC 2020\n\nThe 10 worst food crises in 2019 by number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above)\n\nPercentage of population analysed in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above)\n\nNumber of people (in millions) in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above)\n\n90%\n\n100%\n\n80%\n\n70%\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n20M\n\n18M\n\n16M\n\n14M\n\n12M\n\n10M\n\n8M\n\n6M\n\n4M\n\n2M\n\n0M 0%\n\nYEMEN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\n\nOF THE CONGO\n\nAFGHANISTAN VENEZUELA (BOLIVARIAN REPUBLIC OF)\n\nETHIOPIA SOUTH SUDAN\n\nSYRIAN ARAB\n\nREPUBLIC\n\nSUDAN NORTHERN NIGERIA\n\nHAITI 15.9M 15.6M 11.3M 9.3M 8.0M 7.0M 6.6M 5.9M 5.0M 3.7M\n\n53% 26% 37% 32% 27% 61% 36% 14% 5% 35%\n\nAfricaLatin America and the Caribbean\n\nMiddle East and Asia\n\n2019 135M The number of acutely food-insecure people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) across 55 countries and territories analysed\n\nMore than half of the affected population were in Africa\n\n73M 43M 18.5M\n\nThe data and the analyses in this report were prepared before the global crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic and do not account for its impact on vulnerable people in food-crisis situations.\n\nEurope 0.5M An estimated 75 million stunted children were living in the 55 food-crisis countries analysed. These children have limited access to sufficient dietary energy, nutritionally diverse diets, clean drinking water, sanitation and health care, which weakens their health and nutrition status, with dire consequences for their development and long-term productivity.\n\nDrivers of acute food insecurity Conflict/insecurity was still the main driver of food crises in 2019, but weather extremes and economic shocks became increasingly significant. Over half of the 77 million acutely foodinsecure people in countries where conflict was identified as the primary driver were in the Middle East and Asia. Regional crises continued to see high levels of acute food insecurity, particularly in the Lake Chad Basin and Central Sahel.\n\nAfrica had the largest numbers of acutely food-insecure people in need of assistance in countries badly affected by weather events, particularly in the Horn of Africa and Southern Africa, followed by Central America and Pakistan.\n\nIn East Africa, armed conflicts, intercommunal violence and other localized tensions continued to affect peace and security, particularly in South Sudan, and continued to maintain large refugee populations in neighbouring countries, such as Uganda.\n\nThe report reflects the growing influence of economic crises on acute food insecurity levels, particularly in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Haiti and the Sudan.\n\nAn estimated 79 million people remained displaced globally as of mid-2019 - 44 million of them internally displaced and 20 million were refugees under UNHCR's mandate. More than half of these refugees were hosted in countries with high numbers of acutely food-insecure people. In countries where funding constraints have reduced assistance in refugee camps, refugees' food security was severely threatened.\n\nShort-term outlook for 2020 The acute food insecurity forecasts for 2020 were produced before COVID-19 became a pandemic and do not account for its likely impact in food crisis countries.\n\nThe combined effects of conflict, macroeconomic crisis, climaterelated shocks and crop pests, including fall armyworm and desert locusts, were likely to ensure that Yemen remained the world's worst food crisis.\n\nIn East Africa, abundant seasonal rains benefitted crops and rangelands, but fostered a severe desert locust outbreak that will likely aggravate acute food insecurity in complex and fragile contexts.\n\nProtracted conflicts will either maintain or increase acute food insecurity levels in parts of Central Africa. In Southern Africa, post-harvest improvements are likely to be short-lived as poor\n\nThe number of acutely malnourished children under 5 years across the 55 countries/territories analysed in 201917M rains, high food prices and unresolved political and economic instability could worsen acute food insecurity levels. Increasing violence, displacements and disrupted agriculture and trade in tandem with adverse climate in West Africa and Sahel countries will worsen acute food insecurity conditions in many areas.\n\nViolent conflict and currency depreciation will drive alarming rates of acute food insecurity and acute malnutrition levels across the most troubled areas of the Middle East and Asia.\n\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, sociopolitical crises, weather extremes, lack of employment and high food prices are likely to lead to deteriorating acute food insecurity in some countries.\n\nThe drivers of food crises, as well as lack of access to dietary energy and diversity, safe water, sanitation and health care will continue to create high levels of child malnutrition, while COVID-19 is likely to overburden health systems.\n\nThe pandemic may well devastate livelihoods and food security, especially in fragile contexts and particularly for the most vulnerable people working in the informal agricultural and nonagricultural sectors. A global recession will majorly disrupt food supply chains.\n\nWhile all partners are in broad agreement with the data and information presented in this report, FEWS NET's analyses suggest that the population requiring emergency food assistance in 2019 was lower than the IPC estimates for Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Haiti.\n\nNumbers of acutely food-insecure people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) (millions) by key driver\n\nConflict/insecurity, weather extremes, desert locusts, economic shocks and COVID-19 are expected to be the key drivers of acute food insecurity\n\n34M in 25 countries\n\n77M in 22 countries\n\n24M in 8 countries\n\nConflict/insecurity Weather extremes Economic shocks\n\nP A N D E M I C A L E R T\n\nThe novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is having an unprecedented impact around the world, both in health and socioeconomic terms. By 11 April, 1.6 million cases and nearly 100 000 deaths had occurred globally (WHO, 11 April 2020).\n\nWhile COVID-19 does not discriminate, the 55 countries and territories that are home to 135 million acutely food-insecure people in need of urgent humanitarian food and nutrition assistance are the most vulnerable to the consequences of this pandemic as they have very limited or no capacity to cope with either the health or socioeconomic aspects of the shock.\n\nThese countries may face an excruciating trade-off between saving lives or livelihoods or, in a worst-case scenario, saving people from the corona virus to have them die from hunger. To prevent these tens of millions of people already facing food crises from succumbing to the virus or to its economic consequences, all actors need to mobilize and coordinate along a set of operational and strategic priorities.\n\nIn addition to the countries covered in the GRFC 2020, the pandemic may drive up acute food insecurity levels in other countries. For instance, Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and oil-exporting countries may be severely affected as they are net importers of food with populations that are dependent on income from remittances and tourism.\n\nThe impact on health and nutrition In most of the countries covered in this report, national health systems are already over-stretched, with an alarming dearth of equipment, medicines and trained staff.\n\nPoor people, including displaced people, often lack sufficient economic resources to access health care and/or live in remote areas far from services. Some groups are fearful of being stigmatized or discriminated against in accessing public services.\n\nPeople in food crises often have higher rates of underlying health conditions, including non-communicable diseases and malnutrition (acute, chronic and micronutrient deficiencies), which weaken the immune system and increase the risk of people developing severe COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nRising levels of food insecurity and lack of access to healthcare - either because of movement restrictions, strained health systems or falling incomes - are likely to increase malnutrition rates, particularly among children, pregnant and lactating women and the elderly.\n\nThere are also urgent concerns for the nutritional status of children in families that rely on school feeding programmes to fill food gaps.\n\nThe impact on food availability On the food supply side, harvests have been good and the 2020 outlook for staple crops is promising. However, movement restrictions necessary to contain the spread of the virus will disrupt the transport and processing of food and other critical goods, increasing delivery times and reducing availability of even the most basic food items. For households dependent on food production and livestock rearing, any disruption in the supply chain of agricultural inputs or the inability to access livestock markets, will likely lead to declines in crop and livestock production and sales.\n\nThe food security consequences of the pandemic on nomadic and semi-nomadic pastoralists will likely be grave if national governments close borders, disrupting livestock migration routes, including across the fragile Sahel region. In countries where crop and livestock production are affected by the desert locust outbreak, the restrictions on movement may hinder locust control operations with dramatic consequences for crop production.\n\nThe impact on food access Rising unemployment and under-employment is likely to severely reduce people's purchasing power. Urban populations, particularly daily wage earners in the informal economies and service sector employees, are particularly at risk of losing their income sources as a result of regulations on social distancing and government restrictions to minimize transmission.\n\nThose who are reliant on remittances to meet their basic needs and those who cross borders on a regular basis to engage in livelihood activities will lose their income sources. As households face reduced purchasing power, there is great potential for a decline in consumer demand - particularly for higher value products - further weakening the income of producers, including those who produce high-value food products.\n\nPandemic alert\n\nMobilizing for the impact of COVID-19 in food-crisis countries\n\nMovement restrictions (and illness) are likely to limit the availability of agricultural labour, which will contribute to rising food prices. Protectionism policies, such as tariffs and export bans, could also drive up food prices, while food crisis countries that rely heavily on food imports to cover consumption requirements, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen, will experience rising food prices if their currencies depreciate further relative to the US dollar. If major importers resort to panic buying, the price of globally traded food commodities could increase, particularly in the short term. Whether or not localized food price spikes will trickle down to remote rural markets will depend on the level of integration of local markets, as well as other factors such as harvest performance, seasonality, infrastructure and security.\n\nSimulations developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) indicated that the expected 2020 GDP growth of 2.9 percent (forecast in November 2019) could be downgraded to 1.5 percent if the disease spreads widely across Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America.\n\nGrowing fear in global markets could result in a severe decline in international financing and portfolio outflows from food-insecure countries. As these countries often have limited fiscal and external buffers, this trend would pose a significant risk to their governments' ability to fight the pandemic and maintain existing support to vulnerable households.\n\nThe impact on displaced populations Displaced people living in camps and displaced/host populations in urban areas are particularly vulnerable in overcrowded settings with poor access to adequate health care, lack of clean water, hand-washing facilities and sanitation, where social distancing is difficult, if not impossible. The legal status of refugees often prevents them from being included in national social protection support, putting them at serious risk of rising poverty levels given their severely limited ability to access income. Restrictions on border crossings may prevent asylum seekers from realizing their right for protection and assistance.\n\nSocial tensions and conflict COVID-19 could create the conditions for social and political unrest, especially in the most vulnerable food-crisis countries. Uncertainty of future impacts of the pandemic combined with restrictions on movement, soaring unemployment, limited access to food, and the erosion of already fragile livelihoods may generate discontent, fueling violence and conflict.\n\nA lack of food/goods in refugee camps may increase tension among refugees and host communities. Perceptions that the virus is brought by non-nationals may escalate discrimination and social exclusion, particularly in areas hosting displaced populations.\n\nAny postponement of elections may jeopardize the democratic process and generate tensions between ruling parties and oppositions. The disease could hinder international mediation efforts for conflict resolution, as well as peacekeeping operations.\n\nViolence and exploitation, including sexual exploitation and abuse and intimate partner violence, are likely to increase during epidemic outbreaks due to increased confinement and exposure to perpetrators, increased stress, and reduced income and access to basic needs. Many children who are no longer attending school during the day face increased protection risks at home.\n\nImpacts on humanitarian assistance A major compounding factor for food-crisis countries is that the pandemic is likely to have significant repercussions on the delivery of humanitarian assistance. Resources may be diverted to support COVID-19 efforts, affecting budgets for assistance. Movement restrictions are likely to affect the mobility of supplies and staffincluding the ability to conduct field work. Humanitarian delivery costs may increase as a result.\n\nPre-empting the socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19: priorities for action Given the unprecedented nature of the crisis, creating a better understanding of the potential impacts of COVID-19 and taking rapid collective action to pre-empt its impact on food security and food systems are of paramount importance and urgency.\n\nAnticipatory actions must be undertaken now to safeguard the livelihoods of the most vulnerable people and related agrifood systems to protect the critical food supply chain. Such interventions must comply with government measures and health guidelines and should be designed and implemented in partnership and close coordination between governments, humanitarian and development actors.\n\nExpand near-real time, remote food security monitoring systems to provide up-to-date information on the impacts of the outbreak on food security and livelihoods, health, access to services, markets and supply chains, among others, for early action and mitigation.\n\nPreserve critical humanitarian food, livelihood and nutrition assistance to vulnerable groups - adapted to potential COVID-19 impacts - to ensure that needs are fully met.\n\nPosition food in food-crisis countries to reinforce and scale up social protection systems, ensuring the most vulnerable who are affected or at high risk of COVID-19 can still access food.\n\nScale up support for food processing, transport and local food markets, and advocate for trade corridors to remain open to ensure the continuous functioning of the critical food supply chain and agri-food systems in food-crisis countries.\n\nH U M A N I T A R I A N A N D D E V E L O P M E N T A S S I S T A N C E T O F O O D - C R I S I S C O U N T R I E S\n\nAccording to an analysis of external financial flows for humanitarian and development assistance in 32 of the 53 food crisis countries in the GRFC 2019, humanitarian contributions dedicated to food security, agriculture and nutrition sectors in major food crisis hotspots increased from USD 5.3 billion in 2016 to USD 6.5 billion in 2018 (see figure 1).\n\nThe 32 countries analysed represented 106 million people out of 113 million people identified as experiencing acute hunger (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) in 2018. Unsurprisingly, these 32 most severe food crises accounted for the vast majority of humanitarian contributions to food security, agriculture and nutrition assistance worldwide (between 82 and 86 percent in 2016-2018).\n\nAs figure 2 shows, deep inequalities exist between recipient countries with similar levels of needs in terms of acute food insecurity. For instance, Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Afghanistan each had more than 10 million acutely\n\nFigure 1 Growth of humanitarian assistance to meet rising commitments to food crises USD 5.3B USD 6.0B USD 6.5B\n\nFood security, nutrition and agriculture humanitarian assistance to 32 countries\n\nFood security, nutrition and agriculture humanitarian assistance to other countries\n\nSource: GNAFC 2019, based on data extracted from OCHA FTS and 3RP Annual reports 2016-2018\n\nOverview 2016-2018\n\nHumanitarian and development assistance to food-crisis countries food insecure people in need of assistance, but Yemen received five times more humanitarian assistance than the Democratic Republic of the Congo and seven times more than Afghanistan.\n\nHowever, some of these inequalities may be the result of higher costs of response in certain contexts due to relatively poorer infrastructures and restricted access to populations in need, for instance.\n\nSimilarly, South Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, and the Sudan each accounted for 6.0-6.5 million people in acute food insecurity and had similar needs, but South Sudan and the Syrian Arab Republic received almost four times more assistance than the Sudan.\n\nAlthough Afghanistan had almost 5 million more people in need of urgent food, nutrition and livelihoods assistance than South Sudan, the latter received about three times more humanitarian assistance than Afghanistan. However, these significant differences in external assistance provided between countries must again be considered in the light of the variety of contexts and the various levels of domestic response provided by governments to food crisis situations (i.e. domestic response is not considered in the analysis presented here).\n\nLooking at investment in development, the analysis revealed that the 32 countries/territories with major food crises received significant development assistance (USD 4.2 billion) for food security, agriculture and nutrition sectors in 2017 (figure 3). This represented roughly 40 percent of the total ODA (official development assistance) for these three sectors to food-crisis countries in 2017.\n\nOverall, around USD 4.2 billion was allocated to development and USD 6 billion to humanitarian assistance in food-related sectors in the 32 countries in 2017. In many countries, especially those affected by protracted conflict, the spending on humanitarian assistance far outweighed that on development assistance (figure 4).\n\nFor instance, in 2017 South Sudan received almost USD 700 million in humanitarian assistance and less than USD 200 million for development.\n\nIn Yemen, also in 2017, humanitarian assistance reached more than USD 1 billion, while less than USD 100 million was provided for development assistance. Some countries had more balanced spending on the humanitarian and development assistance. The Democratic Republic of the Congo received comparable levels of humanitarian and development assistance, though both were limited. Ethiopia represents another case where the assistance is balanced and large-scale, most probably due to the presence of relatively stable and well-established investment environment and policy frameworks.\n\nThere is much room to improve the coordination between humanitarian and development efforts in order to enhance impact and address the root causes of protracted crises. Much more analysis is needed at the country level to gain better understanding of how development assistance is best allocated in support of lasting food security and nutrition and resilient agriculture and food supply chains, and how it could be better aligned and coordinated with the humanitarian efforts, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected contexts.\n\nThe analysis of funding flows for humanitarian and development assistance in the major food crisis hotspots was carried out by non profit organization Development Initiatives, and members of the Global Network technical support unit (GNAFC, 2019).\n\nACRONYMS 3RP ....................

Reliable data and analysis are important tools in tackling the root causes of food crises\n\nThe Global Report on Food Crises is the result of a joint assessment of acute food insecurity situations around the world by 16 partners.\n\nBy carrying out collective analysis and providing clear, independent evidence the partners aim to guide coherent and coordinated strategic humanitarian and development investments. The report tracks the numbers and locations of people most in need of emergency food, nutrition and livelihood assistance and it captures how acute food\n\nIntroduction and methods insecurity and malnutrition conditions have changed over time. It identifies the main drivers of acute food insecurity and malnutrition - and explores whether and how conflict, weather extremes and economic shocks interact and exacerbate food crisis situations. It also examines how chronic, structural or seasonal issues combine with shocks to exacerbate situations.\n\nThe data and evidence presented here can inform costefficient and needs-based humanitarian and resiliencebuilding actions, and ultimately enable agencies to seek high-level political action and coordinate policies and actions for durable and innovative ways to tackle the root causes of food crises. In concrete terms, agencies, governments and\n\nThe Global Network Against Food Crises was co-founded by the European Union, FAO and WFP at the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) in response to the call for new approaches to tackle protracted crises and recurrent disasters, reduce vulnerability and better manage risks by bridging the divide between development, humanitarian and conflict-preventing action. The latter is often referred to as the humanitarian-development-peace (HDP) nexus.\n\nThe Global Network brings together partners from across the spectrum of interventions to tackle food crises, incorporating humanitarian and development actions and linking to other sectors, such as education, health, the environment and peace. It aims to develop evidence-based approaches, build capacities and provide knowledge to more effectively prevent, prepare for and respond to food crises, ultimately contributing to longer-term recovery, development and resilience-building efforts.\n\nThe Global Network addresses the multiple facets of food crises that cannot be successfully tackled by individual actors working under their own specific mandates. It facilitates a fundamental change in the way international and local actors interact and promotes a holistic approach to address food crises worldwide. Partners in the Global Network work together and achieve results at national, regional and global level in three key areas:\n\n• Evidence-based analyses of food crisis risks and of people's resilience to various shocks; knowledge management and communication monitoring, evaluation and learning.\n\n• Strategic investments for addressing and preventing food crises.\n\n• Synergies and coordination with other sectors to address the full spectrum of humanitarian, development and peace-building needs. This aims to deliver a more inclusive, equitable, resilient and sustainable set of context-specific responses and solutions.\n\nWithin the Global Network's framework and approach, the Food Security Information Network (FSIN) facilitates the consensus-building process around food security and nutrition analyses, and ensures a constant flow of information and exchange between stakeholders at country, regional and global level around food security and nutrition analysis. other key stakeholders can use the information to bolster the case for changing food systems, building resilience to extreme weather events, resolving conflict, promoting durable peace and upholding international humanitarian law.\n\nThis report is the flagship publication of a series of analytical products facilitated by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN) and produced under the initiative of the Global Network Against Food Crises.\n\nThe humanitarian-development-peace (HDP) nexus has emerged as a major focus of policy debate in the years since the United Nations Secretary General's 2015 report for the World Humanitarian Summit. The Commitment to Action signed at the WHS called on humanitarian, development and other relevant actors to work collaboratively towards collective outcomes that reduce needs, risks and vulnerabilities over multiple years through a \"New Way of Working\".\n\nFunding and financing tools, instruments, policies and approaches have not had time to adapt to the new HDP policy agenda proposed at the WHS. Moreover, practical challenges in the operationalization of the humanitarian and development collaboration in links with peace are emerging. In particular, stakeholders at country level report lack of clarity regarding roles and rules of engagement, as well as significant divergences in principles and practices, limiting the convergence between actors along the nexus.\n\nThe Global Network Against Food Crises is an attempt to foster greater collaboration and cohesive action along the nexus.\n\nWHAT IS FOOD INSECURITY? Food insecurity refers to the lack of secure access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food for normal human growth and development and an active and healthy life. For people to be food secure, food must be both consistently available and accessible in sufficient quantities and diversity and households must be able to utilize (store, cook, prepare and share) the food in a way that has a positive nutritional impact.\n\nAcute food insecurity Acute food insecurity is any manifestation of food insecurity at a specific point in time of a severity that threatens lives, livelihoods or both, regardless of the causes, context or duration. These acute states are highly susceptible to change and can manifest in a population within a short amount of time, as a result of sudden changes or shocks that negatively impact on the determinants of food insecurity and malnutrition (IPC, 2019). Transitory food insecurity is a short-term or temporary inability to meet food consumption requirements related to sporadic crises, indicating a capacity to recover.\n\nChronic food insecurity Chronic food Insecurity is a long-term or persistent inability to meet dietary energy requirements (lasting for a significant period of time during the year), FAO defines this as 'undernourishment' and it is the basis for the SDG indicator 2.1.1 published in SOFI.\n\nPeople experiencing moderate food insecurity face uncertainties about their ability to obtain food and have been forced to reduce, at times during the year, the quality and/or quantity of food they consume due to lack of money or other resources. It thus refers to a lack of consistent access to food, which diminishes dietary quality, disrupts normal eating patterns, and can have negative consequences for nutrition, health and well-being. People facing severe food insecurity, on the other hand, have likely run out of food, experienced hunger and, at the most extreme, gone for days without eating, putting their health and well-being at grave risk (FAO et al., 2019).\n\nIn 2018 'More than 820 million people in the world were undernourished; [...] more than 700 million people were exposed to severe levels of food insecurity' and 'an additional 1.3 billion people, have experienced food insecurity at moderate levels' (The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2019).\n\nDrivers of acute food insecurity The drivers of acute food insecurity are often interlinked and mutually reinforcing, making it difficult to pinpoint the specific trigger or driver of each food crisis. The GRFC 2020 takes a practical approach by estimating which are the most salient for each country/territory out of the broad categories explained below.\n\nConflict/insecurity This includes interstate conflicts, internal violence, regional or global instability, civil unrest or political crises leading to displacements.\n\nIn conflict civilians are frequently deprived of their income sources and pushed into acute food insecurity. Food systems and markets are disrupted, pushing up food prices and sometimes leading to scarcities of water and fuel, or of food itself. Landmines, explosive remnants of war and improvised explosive devices often destroy agricultural land, mills, storage facilities, machinery etc.\n\nConflict prevents businesses from operating and weakens the national economy, reducing employment opportunities, increasing poverty levels and diverting government spending towards the war effort. Health systems are usually damaged or destroyed leaving people reliant on humanitarian support - yet increasingly insecurity and roadblocks prevent humanitarian convoys from reaching the most vulnerable. Or aid agencies face lengthy delays, restrictions on personnel or the type or quantity of aid supplies, or insufficient security guarantees. Parties to conflict can deny people access to food as a weapon of war, especially in areas under blockade/ embargo. Food insecurity itself can become a trigger for violence and instability, particularly in contexts marked by pervasive inequalities and fragile institutions. Sudden spikes in food prices tend to exacerbate the risk of political unrest and conflict (FAO et al., 2017).\n\nWeather extremes These include droughts, floods and the untimely start of rainy seasons.\n\nWeather-related events can directly affect crops and/or livestock, cut offroads and prevent markets from being stocked. Poor harvests push up food prices and diminish agricultural employment opportunities, lowering income at a time when households are more market-reliant because of reduced food stocks.\n\nAdverse weather events are particularly grave for smallholder farmers who cannot afford to invest in the systems and inputs required to withstand and recover from the impacts of such shocks, and for pastoralists who are vulnerable because they rely on rain-fed rangeland for grazing livestock and have very few fixed assets.\n\nPeople's vulnerability to weather shock events rests on their capacity to adapt, the scale and frequency of shocks and their dependence on the affected sector. Repeated events further erode capacity to withstand future shocks. Weather events and changes in climate can often lead to an intensification of conflict between pastoralist herders and farmers over access to water and grazing. There is ample evidence suggesting that natural disasters - particularly droughts - contribute to aggravating existing civil conflicts.\n\nEconomic shocks Economic shocks can affect the food insecurity of households or individuals through various channels. Macroeconomic shocks, characterized by high inflation or hyperinflation, significant currency depreciation, worsening terms of trade, high unemployment rates and loss of income, a significant contraction in exports and a critical decrease in investments and other capital inflows tend to coincide with increases in acute food insecurity. Increases in prices of staple grains, oil or agricultural inputs can affect food availability, food prices and incomes. Microeconomic shocks are characterized by rising food prices, lack of income sources and consequent reduction in purchasing power, which directly affect households' food security.\n\nCountries with weak governance and institutions, or facing armed conflict, civil unrest or instability, are particularly vulnerable to the impact of economic decline. High debt constrains economic growth, increases vulnerability to economic shocks and detracts from development spending.\n\nOther drivers Other drivers are used in the GRFC but are not recorded as the primary driver in any of the countries analysed.\n\nHealth shocks Disease outbreaks (occurrence of disease cases in excess of normal expectancy) are usually caused by an infection, transmitted through person-to-person contact, animal-to-person contact, or from the environment or other media. Water, sanitation, food and air quality are vital elements in the transmission of communicable diseases and in the spread of diseases prone to cause epidemics. Displaced populations - particularly in overcrowded camps - are more susceptible to disease outbreaks which strained health systems cannot prevent or control (WHO).\n\nEpidemics and pandemics can also affect the ability of people to carry on their activities and livelihoods and, in the worst cases when widespread, may also affect markets and supply chains.\n\nCrop pests and animal diseases Fall armyworms, desert locusts, etc can damage crops and may lead to severe production shortfalls. Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), footand-mouth disease (FMD), or Rift Valley fever (RVF) often affect livestock and pastoralists' livelihoods in food-crisis contexts.\n\nNatural disasters (non-weather related) Disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions can lead to major property, infrastructure and/or environmental damage as well as loss of human life.\n\nDisplacement Displacement is often a side-effect of conflict, food insecurity and weather shocks. Displaced people are often more vulnerable to food insecurity and malnutrition having had to abandon their livelihoods and assets, undertake arduous journeys and settle in areas or camps with limited access to basic services or former social networks. Their rights are often restricted due to host country legal frameworks, resulting in a lack of access to land, employment and freedom of movement. They are often dependent on humanitarian assistance to meet their food needs.\n\nForced displacement is the movement of people who have been obliged to leave their homes, particularly to avoid the effects of armed conflict, generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters.\n\nA refugee is someone who has been forced to flee his or her country because of persecution, war or violence. Refugees are recognized under various international agreements. Some are recognized as a group or on a 'prima facie' basis while others undergo an individual investigation before being given refugee status. The 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees provide the full legal definition of a refugee.\n\nAn asylum-seeker is a person seeking sanctuary in a country other than their own and waiting for a decision about their status. The legal processes related to asylum are complex and variable, which is a challenge when it comes to counting, measuring and understanding the asylum-seeking population. When an asylum application is successful, the person is awarded refugee status.\n\nInternally displaced people (IDPs) are those forced to flee their homes as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights, or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an international border.\n\nA stateless person is someone who does not have a nationality of any country. Some people are born stateless, but others become stateless due to a variety of reasons, including sovereign, legal, technical or administrative decisions or oversights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights underlines that 'Everyone has the right to a nationality' (UNGA, 1948, article 15).\n\nAcute food insecurity data sources for the GRFC 2020 IPC/CH analyses for the peak number of acutely food-insecure people in 2019 In the 39 countries where the government and food security stakeholders have adopted the IPC/CH as the protocols for classifying the severity and magnitude of acute food insecurity, the number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC/ CH Phase 3 or above) corresponds to the highest estimates registered for the calendar year, independent of seasonality. For a summary of the IPC/CH classification system refer to countries were selected for inclusion in GRFC 2020\n\nMethodology\n\nCriteria for selecting countries for inclusion in GRFC 2020 in 2019 or 4\n\n4at least once in the past 3 years or 4at least 3 years in the past 10 years.\n\n48 23 countries that requested external assistance for food and/or faced shocks as assessed by FAO GIEWS:\n\nHigh income countries, countries that did not ask for FAO and WFP humanitarian assistance to cope with the shock(s) or countries in which the shock(s) had little impact on food security were not included.\n\n4at least 20% of the population analysed in IPC/CH Phase 3 or above\n\n4at least 1 million people in IPC/CH Phase 3 or above\n\n4any area in IPC/CH Phase 4 or above 4included in the IASC humanitarian system-wide emergency response - level 3. of the selected countries were identified as major crises in 2019 based on the following non-mutually exclusive criteria low or middle-income countries that did not meet GIEWS criteria, but had populations in need of humanitarian assistance as a result of:\n\n4hosting refugee populations who were assisted by UNHCR and WFP\n\n4having over 1 million or at least 20% of its population forcibly displaced\n\n4having populations affected by weather shocks 4having populations affected by conflict and insecurity.\n\n+ table 1, and for the full version of the IPC acute food insecurity reference table, see annex 1 on page 220. The 2019 acute food insecurity estimates are reported in table 5 on page 24, and the latest updates of acute food insecurity estimates available in 2019 are in table 9, annex 3.\n\nPopulations in Crisis (IPC/CH Phase 3), Emergency (IPC/CH Phase 4) and Catastrophe (IPC/CH Phase 5) are deemed to be those in need of urgent food, livelihood and nutrition assistance. Populations in Stressed (IPC/CH Phase 2) require a different set of actions - ideally disaster risk reduction and livelihood protection interventions - and are also indicated in chapter 2. A wide range of sources are used to examine the drivers of acute food insecurity and complement the analysis.\n\nOther sources for countries with no IPC/CH analysis For the handful of countries that have not adopted the IPC or the CH classifications or did not conduct such analyses in 2019, the data sources were FEWS NET IPC-compatible analyses1 (4 countries), WFP assessments using CARI methodology2 (6 countries) and Humanitarian Needs Overviews (HNO)3 (6 countries). See annex 3, table 9.\n\nIPC compatible products are generated using key IPC protocols but are not built on multi-partner technical consensus 2 The Consolidated Approach for Reporting Indicators of Food Security (CARI) is used to classify individual households according to their level of food insecurity. All five indicators included within the CARI approach can be incorporated within IPC analysis. The IPC technical manual provides guidance on where each indicator sits within the IPC analytical framework. For details see https:// resources.vam.wfp.org/data-analysis/quantitative/food-security/cari-the-consolidated-approach-forreporting-indicators-of-food-security. 3 The HNO includes an assessment of the food security situation, the impact of the crisis, the breakdown of the people in need and the required funds. 1\n\nSources for the 2020 forecasts The sources for the outlook and projected trends for 2020 vary. IPC/CH projections are estimated by outlining the main assumptions driving the evolution of food security in the projected period. The focus is on the 'most likely scenario' which helps to devise the potential changes on population distribution across IPC/CH phases. Also, it takes into account the potential effects of planned, funded and likely-to-occur humanitarian assistance in the area of analysis.4\n\nFEWS NET food assistance outlook briefs provide information on the projected severity and magnitude of acute food insecurity (using ranges) and indicate each country's foodinsecure population in need of urgent humanitarian food assistance (IPC Phase 3 or above). FEWS NET projections are based on a scenario development approach where a set of assumptions regarding the evolution of food security drivers and their impacts on food security outcomes in the absence of humanitarian food assistance. The report presents projections considered to be the most-likely scenario.\n\nCH projections forecast the number of people in CH Phase 3 or above for West Africa, the Sahel and Cameroon in a scenario in which no food assistance is provided.\n\nFor more details on forecasting methods, see : http://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ ipcinfo/manual/IPC_Technical_Manual_3_Final.pdf http://www.cilss.int/index.php/2019/10/04/cadre-harmonise-manuel-version-2-0/ https://fews. net/sectors-topics/approach/fews-net-guidance-document-series 4\n\nTable 1\n\nIPC/CH acute food insecurity phase description and response objectives\n\nPhase Technical description\n\nNone/Minimal Households are able to meet essential food and non-food needs without engaging in atypical and unsustainable strategies to access food and income. 1\n\nStressed Households have minimally adequate food consumption but are unable to afford some essential non-food expenditures without engaging in stress-coping strategies. 2\n\nCrisis Households either: • Have food consumption gaps that are reflected by high or above-usual acute malnutrition; OR • Are marginally able to meet minimum food needs but only by depleting essential livelihood assets or through crisis-coping strategies. 3\n\nEmergency Households either: • Have large food consumption gaps which are reflected in very high acute malnutrition and excess mortality; OR • Are able to mitigate large food consumption gaps but only by employing emergency livelihood strategies and asset liquidation. 4\n\nCatastrophe/Famine Households have an extreme lack of food and/or other basic needs even after full employment of coping strategies. Starvation, death, destitution and extremely critical acute malnutrition levels are evident. (For Famine classification, area needs to have extreme critical levels of acute malnutrition and mortality.) 5\n\nPriority response objective Resilience building and disaster risk reduction. Disaster risk reduction and protection of livelihoods. URGENT ACTION REQUIRED to protect livelihoods and reduce food consumption gaps.\n\nURGENT ACTION REQUIRED to save lives and livelihoods.\n\nURGENT ACTION REQUIRED to revert/prevent widespread death and total collapse of livelihoods.\n\nWHAT IS MALNUTRITION? Malnutrition exists in different forms; it includes undernutrition and overnutrition. Undernutrition is more than a lack of food - it is a combination of factors: insufficient energy, protein and micronutrients exacerbated by frequent infections or disease. Malnutrition stunts children's growth, deprives them of essential vitamins and minerals, and makes them more susceptible to frequent and severe disease and infections (UNICEF).\n\nThere are also other forms of malnutrition. While not a focus of this report, it may also refer to overnutrition leading to obesity. This form of malnutrition is on the rise in almost every country in the world. Undernutrition and overnutrition frequently coexist within the same country, community, and even within the same individual. Stunted children, for example, face a greater risk of becoming overweight as adults (UNICEF).\n\nAcute malnutrition A child being too thin for his or her height as a result of rapid weight loss or the failure to gain weight is a sign of acute malnutrition (wasting) which, although treatable, can lead to illness, disability or death. Moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) using the weight for height indicator is identified by weight for height z scores (WHZ) below -2 and above -3 of the reference population, and severe acute malnutrition (SAM) by WHZ below -3. Global acute malnutrition (GAM) reflects both MAM and SAM in a population. Acute malnutrition can also be defined by Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) measurements ≤ 12.5 cm, with severe acute malnutrition defined with a measurement of ≤11.5 cm. Children affected require urgent feeding, treatment and care to survive. Acute malnutrition rates depict the nutrition situation in the general population at a specific time: they can show marked seasonal patterns and can change quickly over time. See table 2.\n\nChronic malnutrition A child being too short for his or her age (stunting) is considered chronically malnourished. This condition is preventable from the 1 000 days between a woman's pregnancy and the time her child turns two. The physical and cognitive damage caused by stunting can be irreversible and has far-reaching consequences, from diminished learning and school performance to lower future earnings, and can affect the next generation. Stunted children under 5 years old are identified by a height for age z score (HAZ) below -2 of the reference population. Severe stunting is defined as HAZ below -3. See table 3.\n\nMicronutrient deficiencies Deficiencies of vitamin A, iron and zinc are often referred to as 'hidden' hunger because it develops gradually over time, and a large percentage of the population may be deficient without showing any clinical symptoms or signs of deficiency.\n\nDrivers of malnutrition in food crises The immediate cause of acute malnutrition is a severe nutritional restriction either as a result of inadequate food intake, or a recent bout of illness, such as diarrhoea, that hinders appropriate intake and absorption of nutrients. The determinants of malnutrition also include inadequate access to healthcare, water and sanitation services, inappropriate child feeding and care practices, as described in the UNICEF framework .\n\nChildren require an adequate amount of nutrient dense foods for their optimum growth and development, to build immunity to infections and protect against disease. Exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life followed by the timely introduction of safe and nutritionally adequate complementary foods with continued breastfeeding until 2 years of age or beyond, ensures children receive all the nutrients they need. Pregnant and lactating women also need to consume foods from a variety of food groups, with adequate and appropriate nutrients and energy to meet the increased physiological requirements, to sustain healthy fetal growth and development, and support lactation.\n\nDuring humanitarian crises, access to nutritious foods may be limited by food shortages or disrupted food systems compromising the availability of adequate and safe complementary foods for vulnerable children. When food production is limited, and/or markets and infrastructure are functioning poorly the cost of food increases and vulnerable households with limited purchasing power struggle to provide children with the nutritious diet they require.\n\nIn addition, caregivers during emergencies may have reduced time to prepare nutritious meals and care for children because they may, for instance, have to take on additional agricultural tasks, care for other vulnerable family members or take longer to access services and water. In some contexts - such as during displacements - the precarious living conditions may also hinder the hygienic preparation of meals.\n\nDisplaced populations often face severely compromised access to safe water and improved sanitation and are at increased risk of frequent outbreaks of infectious disease, which weakened health systems cannot treat, prevent or control. Measles, cholera, Ebola and dengue fever outbreaks are illnesses that have a negative impact on the overall health and nutritional status of individuals, especially young children. In crises children are often not able to access other preventive services such as micronutrient supplementation and immunization, further increasing the risk of malnutrition. Displacement can also result in the break-down of familial and community networks that provide the necessary support and guidance needed for looking after young children.\n\nNutrition data sources for the GRFC 2020 The nutrition analysis was conducted only for countries facing a food crisis to complement the acute food insecurity analysis. The nutritional status of children and related contributing factors was assessed using globally agreed indicators and standards.\n\nThe GRFC reviews and analyses most recent available country data on anthropometry, dietary intake, infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices, health and WASH indicators from national and sub-national nutrition surveys. These include representative SMART (Standardized Monitoring and Assessment for Relief and Transitions) surveys, Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicators Cluster Surveys (MICS), National Vulnerability Assessments and Analysis, and Infant and Young Child Feeding - Knowledge Attitude and Practices Assessments (IYCF KAP). For refugee populations nutrition data comes from UNHCR Standardized Expanded Nutrition Surveys (SENS).\n\nThe GRFC uses the Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates 2019 (UNICEF, WHO, WB) for the number of children affected by stunting and acute malnutrition globally. In chapter 3, it uses in-country calculations approved by the nutrition clusters/ sectors and shared in key planning documents such as HNOs and Humanitarian Response Plans (HRP) including projections. For the drivers, it consults the above surveys and WHO, UNICEF, OCHA, ACAPS, UNHCR and other sources.\n\nIn 2019, 10 countries (Chad, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, the Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Uganda, Somalia and South Sudan) conducted an IPC acute malnutrition analysis in areas known to have high rates of acute malnutrition. The results of these analyses are shared in this report.\n\nThe IPC analysis process reviews all contributing factors affecting acute malnutrition in the area of analysis and classifies the severity of a nutrition situation in a population, using defined indicators. See table 4 below. The level of Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) is used to classify the severity of acute malnutrition and key factors such as dietary intake, disease, feeding and care practices, health and WASH environment and contextual information such as access to services, mortality etc are all included in the analysis.\n\nMinimum dietary diversity for children aged 6-23 months\n\nThis indicator refers to the percentage of children aged 6-23 months who receive foods from more than five out of eight food groups a day. The eight food groups are: i. breastmilk; ii. grains, roots and tubers; iii. legumes and nuts; iv. dairy products (infant formula, milk, yogurt, cheese); v. flesh foods (meat, fish, poultry and liver/organ meats); vi. eggs; vii. vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables; viii. other fruits and vegetables.\n\nIn some surveys minimum dietary diversity is calculated based on seven food groups, excluding breastmilk. In these cases, the indicator refers to the percentage of children aged 6-23 months who receive foods from more than four out of seven food groups a day.\n\nMinimum meal frequency\n\nThe indicator refers to the proportion of breastfed and non-breastfed children aged 6-23 months who receive solid, semi-solid or soft foods at least the minimum number of recommended times a day.\n\nMinimum acceptable diet\n\nThis composite indicator combines meal frequency and dietary diversity to assess the proportion of children aged 6-23 months consuming a diet that meets the minimum requirements for growth and development.\n\nPercentage of households not consuming micronutrient-rich food (analysed in refugee populations)\n\nThis refers to the proportion of households with no member consuming any vegetables, fruits, meat, eggs, fish/seafood, and milk/milk products over a reference period of 24 hours. The food group of vegetables, fruits, meat, eggs, fish/seafood, and milk/milk products are the same as the 12 food groups defined by FAO (2011).\n\nExclusive breastfeeding\n\nThis indicator refers to the percentage of infants fed exclusively with breast milk up to six months of age, as recommended by WHO.\n\nPrevalence of anaemia\n\nThis indicator refers to the proportion of children aged 6-59 months and of reproductive age women (15-49 years) who are anaemic.\n\nAnaemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells or their oxygen-carrying capacity is insufficient to meet physiological needs, which varies by age, sex, altitude, smoking and pregnancy status. Iron deficiency is thought to be the most common cause of anaemia globally, although other conditions, such as folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin A deficiencies, chronic inflammation, parasitic infections and inherited disorders can all cause anaemia. In its severe form, it is associated with fatigue, weakness, dizziness and drowsiness. Pregnant women and children are particularly vulnerable (WHO).\n\nAccess to basic drinking water services\n\nImproved drinking water sources are those which, by nature of their design and construction, have the potential to deliver safe water. The WHO and UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) subdivides the population using improved sources into three groups (safely managed, basic and limited) according to the level of service provided. In order to meet the criteria for a safely managed drinking water service, people must use an improved source meeting three criteria: accessible on premises; available when needed; free from contamination.\n\nIf the improved source does not meet any one of these criteria but a round trip to collect water takes 30 minutes or less, then it is classified as a basic drinking water service. If water collection from an improved source exceeds 30 minutes, it is categorized as a limited service (WHO and UNICEF).\n\nFor refugees, the indicator refers to the type of drinking water source used by the household and serves to indicate whether their drinking water is of a suitable quality or not.\n\nAdditional nutrition indicators used in GRFC 2020\n\nLIMITATIONS\n\nConsensus All partners are in agreement with the approximate degree of magnitude and severity of acute food insecurity indicated for the countries included in this report, except in the cases of Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti and Ethiopia, for which FEWS NET's analyses of available evidence suggest that the population requiring emergency food assistance in 2019 was lower than the estimates based on the IPC. The differences stem from varying interpretations of the data related to factors contributing to acute food insecurity.\n\nData gaps and challenges Omission of 16 countries because of insufficient evidence to produce estimates of people in Crisis or worse (IPC/ CH Phase 3 or above, or equivalent) Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Comoros, Congo, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Djibouti, Syrian refugees in Egypt and Jordan, Eritrea, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Kyrgyzstan, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Nepal, Venezuelan migrants in Peru, Philippines and Tajikistan and displaced populations in Algeria/Western Sahara.\n\nUnderestimation of numbers of people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above, or equivalent) for many countries Data collection is not always national, and may only take place in accessible areas or those affected by a localized shock. Data collection might also have been conducted out of the peak season or the analysis did not include a projection for the timing of peak needs. In addition, the number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) does not necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent action to decrease food gaps and protect and save lives and livelihoods. This is because some households may only be classified in IPC/CH Phase 1 or 2 because they receive assistance, and are in fact in need of continued action. The number in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) refers to populations in need of action further to that already taken.\n\nAbsence of estimates for populations in Stressed (IPC/CH Phase 2) pending data sources Bangladesh, Burundi, Iraq, Libya, Nicaragua, Rwanda, Uganda and Ukraine. This is mainly the case when using FEWS NET, HNOs or to a lesser extent WFP analyses as the source.\n\nLack of data availability and comparability for refugee food security Refugee food security is measured in various ways across refugee populations and data are not systematically collected, disaggregated, consolidated or shared. Detailed, comparative analysis on refugee food security at country, regional or global level is not possible with current systems and processes, and particularly not in a comparable way to IPC/CH protocols.\n\nLimited availability and frequency of national nutrition surveys and/or IPC acute malnutrition analyses Only 10 countries - Chad, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, the Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, South Sudan and Uganda - conducted an IPC acute malnutrition analysis in 2019.\n\nLimited predictive analysis (acute food insecurity and malnutrition) For several countries with no IPC/CH or compatible products where alternative estimates are used, predictive analyses are not available. In some cases where IPC/CH is used, data collection and analysis updates are not as frequent as might be needed to provide estimates for the forecast section of this report. IPC-compatible analyses offer range values for forecasts rather than precise estimates. Not all countries with a 2019 IPC acute malnutrition analysis had a projection beyond publication of the GRFC 2020.\n\nComparability challenges Most IPC results presented in this report are based on the IPC Technical Manual Version 3.0, which was launched in April 2019 and CH Technical Manual Version 2.0 for analyses carried out in October-November 2019. The use of these revised protocols does not affect the comparability of numbers of food-insecure people with previous analysis periods and between countries.\n\nFor some countries, the coverage of food security analyses within and between years varies in terms of population (e.g. rural only vs. rural and urban) and/or areas analysed (e.g. part of the country vs. whole country). This affects the comparability of the number of acutely food-insecure people between time periods. In a few countries (e.g. Bangladesh, Burundi, Djibouti), no IPC acute food insecurity analysis was conducted in 2019. Depending on whether other comparable sources of information could be found, this hampers comparability with previous years and highlights the importance for food-crisis countries to conduct an IPC analysis at least once a year. not collected/ area is inaccessible not comparable across time or geographical areas scattered across various sources not disaggregated by age, gender or IPC/CH phases incomplete\n\nData can be missing because it is Chapter 2 starts with a graphical and textual analysis of the key findings of the GRFC 2020. It provides the main list of 55 countries and territories in food crises, supplying the peak number of acutely food-insecure people in 2019.\n\nRefer to the rest of the chapter for regional overviews of 2019 food crises for which data was available: three regions of Africa; Asia and the Middle East; Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nChapter 3 covers the 35 most serious food crises in alphabetical order from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. There is a graphical overview page for each country crisis providing the key relevant food security and nutrition data; a summary of the main drivers in order of their contribution to the country's food crisis and the displacement figures that are most relevant for the country/territory.\n\nThe rest of each country profile provides a more granular analysis of the acute food insecurity and nutrition situation in 2019 and discusses the drivers in some depth. Each profile is illustrated with maps that give a sense of severity by region and, where possible, graphs that convey changes over time.\n\nChapter 4 provides a table with pre-COVID-19 pandemic estimates of the number of acutely food-insecure people in need of urgent action in 2020.\n\nIt further provides an analysis of expected trends by country/territory in 2020. It explains the assumptions underlying the acute food insecurity forecasts for 2020. Regional maps of Africa, Asia and Latin America/Caribbean indicate the projected ranges of the numbers of people in IPC/CH Phase 3 or above as well as primary drivers and risks by country.\n\nHow to use this report\n\nURGENT CALL TO ACTION TO IMPROVE DATA ANALYTICS\n\nIf governments, humanitarian actors and development agencies are to prevent food crises from getting worse in both severity and magnitude they need reliable, timely and accessible data and analysis to inform early warning and early action.\n\nAcross most editions of the GRFC, data has been missing for seven countries (Congo, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, the Philippines and Sri Lanka), while for the first time in the 2020 report an assessment provided an estimate for the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\n\nWhile all partners are in broad agreement with the analysis provided in the report, divergences in interpreting the data related to the factors contributing to acute food insecurity in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Haiti have led to a disclaimer for these countries since the report was launched in 2017.\n\nMajor data availability challenges, both for food security and nutrition, remain in inaccessible areas of countries and this year's report highlights that there is no comparable analysis available for refugee populations.\n\nThe humanitarian and development community need to come together to better address the gaps in existing data collection systems, identify data and analysis standards where they don't exist, engage with countries where there is limited data or consistent divergences in their interpretation.\n\nThe need to invest in technology-savvy monitoring systems and predictive analysis has become even more apparent in the context of COVID-19. The data community must adapt its tools to provide timely, reliable measurement of the impact of COVID-19 on food security and make the data easy to access, interpret and use by policymakers to enable them to make evidence-based decisions.\n\nA N A L Y S I S O F F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9\n\nAnalysis of food crises in 2019 in 55 countries were in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above)\n\n108M people in 48 countries\n\n124M people in 51 countries\n\n135M people Numbers in previous years\n\n2016 2017 2018 113M people in 53 countries\n\nFOOD CRISES IN 2019 In 2019, almost 135 million people in 55 countries or territories, or 16 percent of the total population analysed, were classified in Crisis conditions or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above). This marks the highest number in the four years since the GRFC launched.\n\nDoes this represent a major increase compared with previous years?\n\nThe number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) increased by 22 million between 2018 and 2019, as a result of worsening acute food insecurity conditions in key conflict-driven crises, notably the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan, and more severe droughts and economic shocks in Guatemala, Haiti, Pakistan, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Burkina Faso and the Niger in the Sahel, and Cameroon also saw big increases in the number of people in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above), largely as a result of intensified conflict and greater displacement of people.\n\nHowever, the increase between 2018 and 2019 also reflects increased geographical coverage thanks to greater data availability: in 2019, data became available for Angola, Namibia, Rwanda, the United Republic of Tanzania and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which added an additional 11.4 million people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) to the global total. The 2019 total also significantly exceeds that of 2017 (124 million people) and 2016 (108 million), but again availability of data played an important role in the difference between the years.\n\nWhen comparing the 50 countries that were in both the 2019 and the 2020 reports, the population in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) rose from 112 to 123 million. When comparing the same 40 countries that have featured in each edition of the GRFC, the total number was also the highest in 2019 (see figure 6).\n\nDemocratic Republic of the\n\nCongo\n\nAfghanistan\n\nThree countries accounted for one third of the global number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above)\n\n15.6M\n\nYemen 15.9M 11.3M\n\nWhich are the worst-affected countries and regions?\n\nFor the second year in a row, three conflict-affected countries - Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Afghanistan - had the largest populations in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above), representing 32 percent of the total population in food crises. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) appeared as the world's fourth largest food crisis with 9.3 million people acutely food insecure and in need of urgent assistance as new data became available in 2019.\n\nTen countries - Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Ethiopia, South Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, the Sudan, Nigeria and Haiti - constituted the worst food crises and accounted for 65 percent of the total population in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) or 88 million people.\n\nIn terms of prevalence, seven countries - South Sudan, Yemen, the Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, the Syrian Arab Republic and Haiti - stood out as major food crises in 2019, each with more than 35 percent of their population analysed in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above), peaking at 61 percent in South Sudan, followed by 53 percent in Yemen.1 Two migrant/ refugee populations analysed in hosting countries had a very high prevalence of acute food insecurity: Venezuelan refugees in Ecuador (76 percent) and Colombia (55 percent).\n\nAfrica remained as the continent most affected by food crises, accounting for 54 percent of the global total number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above). The number in Southern Africa was the highest at 30.4 million, increasing from\n\nAngola and Pakistan were not included as only 3 percent of their total populations were analysed, even though a high percentage of these were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above). 1\n\n23.3 million in 2018, partly due to the addition of three countries (United Republic of Tanzania, Angola and Namibia) where data was unavailable last year, but also due to a deterioration in the acute food insecurity situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe six East African countries in the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) region accounted for 27.5 million people in food crisis, representing a slight increase from 2018 (26.7 million), mainly due to weather-related shocks in Kenya, conflict and persistent economic challenges in South Sudan and the refugee influx and weather extremes in Uganda.\n\nCountries in West Africa and the Sahel, and Cameroon accounted for more than 12 million people in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above). This represents a slight rise from 11 million in 2018 due to a notable increase in acute food insecurity in Burkina Faso, the Cameroon and the Niger. Although there was a year-on-year decline in Chad and Senegal, and a stabilisation in northern Nigeria and Mali, the situation deteriorated towards the end of 2019 in all these countries.\n\nAsia and the Middle East accounted for 32 percent of the total with an increase in the number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) in Pakistan. Afghanistan also faced an increase although this is explained by the inclusion of the urban population.\n\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, the total number of people in food crisis was 18.6 million across eight countries and represented around 14 percent of the global population facing Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) worldwide.\n\nWhy is the situation worsening? As shown, the number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) continued to increase and the severity of food crises appears to be deepening. Conflict/insecurity was still the primary driver of food crises in 2019. The total number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) living in conflict-driven food crises rose from 74 million in 21 countries in 2018 to more than 77 million people in 22 countries, in 2019. As figure 8 shows, the majority of these people (40 million) lived in nine countries in Asia/the Middle East where protracted armed conflict and violence continued to be fuelled by political, social and economic grievances or geopolitical tensions.\n\nIn East Africa, armed conflicts, violent extremism, intercommunal violence and other localized tensions continued to affect peace and security, particularly in South Sudan and continued to maintain large refugee populations in neighbouring countries, such as Uganda.\n\nIn West Africa, there were two major hotspots: the Lake Chad Basin - which consists of sub-national areas in Cameroon, Chad, the Niger and northern Nigeria - and the Central Sahel where Burkina Faso, Mali and the Niger are affected. In both areas, insecurity led to massive displacement of populations, destruction or closure of basic social services, disruption of productive activities, markets and trade flows. Burkina Faso was people in 34 countries were in Emergency (IPC/CH Phase 4) or equivalent. people in South Sudan and Yemen were in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5).\n\n27M people\n\n84 500 people\n\n5M additional people were pushed into Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) since 2018 by adverse weather extremes because of the worsening situation in Central America, parts of Africa and Pakistan1\n\n13M additional people in countries where economic shocks formed the main driver mainly because of the inclusion of Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) and worsening situation in Haiti and Zimbabwe\n\n3M additional people were in conflict-affected countries, with violence increasing in Burkina Faso, Cameroon and the Niger and persisting in numerous other countries including Afghanistan, South Sudan and Yemen one of the world's fastest growing crises with the daily lives and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of civilians disrupted by insecurity and violence mainly in central and northern regions.\n\nThe growing intensity and severity of extreme weather events also contributed to the increased number of people in food crises in 2019 by comparison with 2018. As figure 9 shows, weather extremes were the primary driver of the acute food insecurity situation of almost 34 million people in 25 countries in 2019 by comparison with 29 million in 2018. All but five of these countries were in Africa with the largest numbers of people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) in countries badly affected by weather events in the IGAD region (13.2 million) and Southern Africa (11.2 million). Four of the countries were in Central America (4.4 million people). Drought-affected Sindh and Balochistan provinces in Pakistan accounted for 3.1 million people.\n\nWhile still considered the tertiary driver of acute food insecurity globally, economic shocks were considered the main driver for 24 million people in eight countries - up from 10 million across six countries in 2018. While the economic crises persisted in the Sudan and worsened in Zimbabwe over the last year this increase is largely due to the inclusion of Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) where 9.3 million people were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) largely as the result of a man-made economic crisis.\n\nPopulations in Stressed (IPC/CH Phase 2) Countries with large numbers of acutely food-insecure people in need of urgent assistance tend to have even higher numbers of vulnerable people 'on the cusp' of Crisis (IPC/CH Phase 3). Classified in Stressed (IPC/CH Phase 2), these populations have minimal adequate food consumption and have to use foodrelated coping strategies.\n\nIn 2019, around 182.6 million people were classified in Stressed (IPC/CH Phase 2) conditions across 47 countries, with 71 percent of them concentrated in 32 countries in Africa, see figure 11. Around 40 percent of them were in just four countries - the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) and the Sudan - and another 19 percent were in Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Yemen and Kenya. As figure 10 shows, these eight countries accounted for around 60 percent of the total population in Stressed (IPC/CH Phase 2).\n\nThe data shows that the numbers facing Stressed (IPC/CH Phase 2) conditions has changed very little over time. In the 39 countries for which data was available in both 2018 and 2019, the population classified in Stressed (IPC/CH Phase 2) slightly increased from 142.4 million in 2018 to 144.1 million in 2019.\n\nGlobally, at least one in three children under 5 years are not receiving adequate nutrition for optimum growth and development. At least 340 million children under 5 years - around one in two children - suffer from 'hidden' hunger due to micronutrient deficiencies (UNICEF, 2019). The 2019 Joint Malnutrition Estimates report indicates that globally 49.5 million children under 5 years of age suffer from wasting, with 16.6 million of them severely wasted, and almost 149 million are stunted (UNICEF, WHO, WB, 2019). Of these children living in the 55 food-crisis countries, 17 million suffer from wasting and 75 million are stunted.\n\nIn the 10 worst food crises (by number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) there were 9 million acutely malnourished children under 5 years. In terms of numbers of acutely malnourished children, the situation was particularly concerning in Pakistan, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan, Afghanistan and Yemen, which accounted for nearly 20 million wasted children, or 40 percent of the global total.\n\nLack of nutritionally diverse diets for children in food crises\n\nIn countries affected by food crises, where food availability and access to nutrient-rich food groups are severely restricted, the nutritional status of already vulnerable children is extremely concerning, with one out of two children stunted. In eight of the major food crises profiled in this report more than 40 percent of children were stunted. See figure 12.\n\nIn 10 countries among the worst food crises, fewer than 20 percent of 6-23 month-old children received the minimum dietary diversity requirement (see map 1, page 26). In the Niger and Chad fewer than 10 percent of young children received a minimum recommended diverse diet. See figure 13.\n\nLimited access to basic services increases vulnerabilities\n\nDuring emergencies, shocks that influence food systems, including conflict/insecurity, weather extremes (drought/floods), economic shocks, crop pests and disease, affect availability and access to nutritious foods for children and pregnant and lactating\n\nFocus\n\nOverview of malnutrition in food crises in 2019\n\nSource: UNICEF 2020 children under 5 years old were suffering from wasting across the 55 countries/territories with a food crisis children under 5 years old were stunted across the 55 countries/ territories with a food crisis\n\n17M\n\n75M fewer than 20 percent of children meet the minimum dietary diversity\n\n20-39 percent of children meet the minimum dietary diversity\n\n40-59 percent of children meet the minimum dietary diversity\n\n60-79 percent of children meet the minimum dietary diversity\n\nMinimum Dietary Diversity (MDD) among children in countries affected by major food crises Source: FSIN, based on data extracted from UNICEF database and national nutrition surveys, 2019. The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations. women. Food production, storage, processing, distribution and markets may be disrupted during crises, making it more difficult for these groups to meet their dietary needs.\n\nAccess to basic health services is critical to prevent the occurrence of disease outbreaks. High rates of illness compromise the nutritional status of the population, particularly children and pregnant and lactating women.\n\nIn food-crisis countries, often a lack of safe water and sanitation increases the likelihood of disease outbreaks. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Chad, Ethiopia, Madagascar and South Sudan around 60 percent of households or more did not have access to at least basic drinking water services. See figure 14.\n\nFurthermore, people usually have limited economic access to health services or health systems have collapsed - with lack of infrastructure, medicines, equipment and trained staff.\n\nIn Somalia, the 2019 floods, coupled with impaired health systems among IDPs and other populations affected by conflict, have resulted in cholera and measles outbreaks throughout the year, negatively affecting the nutrition status of children. There were also measles outbreaks in Chad and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and cholera outbreaks in Ethiopia, Mali, Yemen and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which also had the world's second biggest ever Ebola outbreak.\n\nChildren in food crises are often not able to access preventive services such as micronutrient supplementation and immunization programmes, increasing the risk of them becoming malnourished.\n\nAccess to health care and child nutrition and immunization services are often cut off in food crises, increasing the risk of children becoming malnourished.\n\nDisease increases the risk of malnutrition. Floods, displacement and collapsing health systems contributed to high levels of disease outbreaks in many food-crisis countries in 2019\n\nGlobal trends in displacement Conflict, persecution, generalized violence and violations of human rights led to continued high levels of forced displacement in the first half of 2019. At 30 June 2019, UNHCR reported a total population of concern of 79.4 million people. This included 20.2 million refugees under UNHCR's mandate, 3.7 million asylum-seekers, 531 000 returned refugees, 44.9 million IDPs, 2.3 million returned IDPs and 3.9 million stateless people (UNHCR, February 2020). See figure 15.\n\nThe total number of Venezuelan refugees and migrants increased from under 3.1 million at the beginning of 2019 to over 4.1 million by the middle of the year. Conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa, including in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Mali, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Sudan, fueled new displacements in all these cases in 2019.\n\nMore than half of all refugees under UNHCR's mandate are hosted in eight countries that have very high numbers of people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) - sometimes because of the presence of the refugees. Some 6.2 million of the world's refugees are hosted in sub-Saharan Africa - the majority of them in East and the Horn of Africa (4.2 million), with Uganda and the Sudan hosting the largest numbers in the region. See figures 16 and 17 on pages 27 and 28.\n\nDisplacement fuels food insecurity Displacement often results in a loss of livelihoods and productive assets as well as reduction in income and economic opportunities. There are often financial and physical costs associated with displacement. Refugee populations in particular often find it difficult to access food due to legal restrictions on their rights to work, access to land to cultivate food and freedom of movement. Refugee and internally displaced persons are often not successfully included in national services and systems, exposing them to greater risks of poverty and malnutrition.\n\nRefugees who settle in host countries with restrictive legal frameworks that impede their access to land, employment, freedom of movement and other basic human rights usually face\n\nPopulation displacement and food insecurity Please note that the figures contained in this section are taken from UNHCR's mid-year trends.

They often face abuse and/or stigma in the informal labour market.\n\nFood insecurity can trigger displacement As well as being a possible outcome of displacement, food insecurity can trigger it, often exacerbated by and entwined with conflict to form a vicious cycle. Limited or deteriorating access to productive assets such as land, water, livestock, agricultural inputs, as well as low agricultural productivity and/or price spikes reduce household food security and can be among the many push factors leading to migration and displacement. By its definition, this is not forced displacement, but can be seen as a similar phenomenon that some have called 'survival migration' (FAO et al, 2018). In conjunction with poverty, food insecurity may increase the likelihood and intensity of armed conflict (Holleman et al, 2017).\n\nMigrants from Bangladesh and East and West Africa report food insecurity and economic vulnerability as key drivers for outward migration, while Syrians and Afghans claim that lack of safety and security as well as sustained conflict that destroyed employment opportunities and markets, triggered their migration (WFP, May 2017). Food shortages and high food prices were the leading causes of displacement reported by Venezuelans who fled to Colombia, Peru and Ecuador (WFP, 2019).\n\nAcute food insecurity and nutrition In many host countries refugees' ability to obtain food in sufficient quantity and quality depends mostly on their access to humanitarian food assistance. Refugees in 35 countries receive humanitarian food assistance to help promote food security and support livelihoods, but in some cases the size of rations and other basic assistance have been cut as a result of funding constraints (see box on refugees in Malawi on the following page). This has resulted not only in increased food insecurity and malnutrition, but greater protection risks as refugees engage in negative coping strategies to meet their essential needs (WFP, December 2019).\n\nWhile acute malnutrition among refugees is improving in many areas, it remains of major concern in Bangladesh, eastern Chad, Gambella (Ethiopia), South Sudan and the Sudan. Chronic malnutrition in refugee populations is extremely concerning with almost half of refugee sites above the 'very high' threshold (≥ 30 percent) for stunting. Two thirds of sites have very high anaemia prevalence which is greater than the threshold for public health concern (UNHCR, January 2020).\n\nSYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC Malawi hosts over 45 000 refugees or asylum seekers in Dzaleka refugee camp in Dowa district. The majority (62 percent) originate from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, followed by Burundi, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Somalia (UNHCR Feb 2020). Many have been displaced for decades, but there is still a steady stream of new arrivals, with approximately 470 arriving in the camp each month (UNHCR, December 2019).\n\nMore than half reportedly want to develop businesses, engage in agriculture and/or find employment to be able to meet their own needs. However, they are unable to do so because of a legal framework that denies them the rights to work, access to land, and freedom of movement (WFP, November 2018). Only 14 percent of the refugee households cultivate crops and 12 percent own livestock, mainly poultry (WFP, December 2019). As a result, they are highly dependent on food assistance.\n\nSome 83 percent live below the national poverty line and 70 percent of them live below the ultra-poverty line, according to a 2017 analysis (UNHCR/WFP, December 2018). A large number of women and young girls in the camp reported regularly engaging in transactional sex (several times a day) to meet their basic needs (UNHCR/WFP, December 2018 and UNHCR, April 2018).\n\nWFP has provided in-kind food assistance for years. For around half of the refugee households it is the main source of income (WFP, December 2019). But the ration was reduced to 50 percent from May 2019 due to funding shortfalls (WFP, August 2019).\n\nAccording to WFP's December 2019 data, the proportion of household expenditure allocated to food has increased drastically since food assistance was cut, with 80 percent of refugee families spending more than half on food compared to around 50 percent before the cuts. The proportion of households spending 65 percent or more on food increased from around 26 percent in 2018 to 54 percent in 2019 (WFP, December 2019). This indicates that the majority of the little income they have is used to purchase food.\n\nThe proportion of refugee families with inadequate food consumption (i.e. poor or borderline diets) increased slightly from 36 percent in 2018 to 42 percent in 2019 - due mainly to an increase in those with 'borderline' diets. The consumptionbased coping strategies index reached its highest level, meaning that households were turning to negative coping strategies to maintain food consumption (transactional sex, begging, selling assets, theft etc). Vulnerable populations - women, girls, children, the ill, disabled and elderly - who have few other avenues for obtaining food were particularly likely to resort to coping strategies that are harmful to their wellbeing (UNHCR and WFP, December 2018).\n\nRecently, there have been pockets of protests by refugees in the camp over food cuts and insecurity, which have the potential to escalate. At the same time, Malawi is struggling with high national poverty rates so host communities lack the economic resilience to cope with and recover from shocks and stressors (UNHCR, March 2020).\n\nConsequences of cuts to food assistance on refugees in Malawi\n\n© UNHCR/TINA GHELLI\n\nMujinikile Kabika Marie, age 52, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo sells potatoes at the weekly Dzaleka market to help support her five children.\n\nIn 2019, over 27 million people in six IGAD member states (Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, the Sudan and Uganda), were classified in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above). This figure represents around 20 percent of the global total number of acutely food-insecure people in need of urgent humanitarian food and livelihood assistance.\n\nThe trend of rising numbers of acutely food-insecure people in the region - observed each year since 2016 - continued into 2019. The number of people in need of urgent food assistance (IPC Phase 3 or above) increased by 600 000 compared to 2018,1 mainly driven by rising acute food insecurity in South Sudan, Kenya, Uganda and the Sudan.2 Acute food insecurity persisted at similar levels in Ethiopia and improved in Somalia. See figure 22.\n\nThe six countries faced all three main drivers of acute food insecurity - weather extremes, conflict/insecurity and economic shocks - with negative impacts reinforcing each other, adding to the complexity of the food security situation. See figure 21.\n\nWeather extremes In the first half of 2019 many agricultural and pastoral areas of the Horn of Africa experienced a second consecutive poor rainy season, following that of late 2018. By late April, cumulative rainfall totals were up to 80 percent below normal across much of the region (FAO-GIEWS, 2019).\n\nThe unfavourable weather conditions, among the driest on record in several areas, were largely caused by Tropical Cyclone Idai, which formed in early March in the Mozambique Channel and redirected precipitations away from East Africa (FSNWG, April- May 2019). The severe dryness resulted in germination failure and crop wilting, with a negative impact on the planted area and yields. Above-average precipitation in late April and May reduced moisture deficits and marginally improved vegetation conditions, but damage to crops was irreversible in several cropping areas as precipitation occurred too late during the growing season (FAO-GIEWS, July 2019).\n\nIn southern Somalia, for example, the output of the main Gu harvest was estimated at 60 percent below average, the lowest Unlike in 2018, 2019 regional estimates do not include Djibouti due to a lack of data. In 2018, there were 157 000 food-insecure people in rural areas of Djibouti. 2 Based on analyses that were comparable for 2018 and 2019 peaks (excluding West Darfur). 1\n\nRegional overview\n\nEast Africa Ethiopia Kenya Somalia South Sudan Sudan Uganda in 6 IGAD member states were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above)\n\n20% of the global number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) were in this region\n\nSouth Sudan Sudan of people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) across the region were in three countries75%\n\n5.9M\n\nEthiopia\n\n8M 7M in 5 countries in the IGAD member states were in Stressed (IPC Phase 2). 2019\n\nNote: No estimates for Uganda.\n\n35M people since 1995. Below-average harvests were also gathered in Ethiopia's Belg/Gu/Genna receiving areas, Kenya's south-eastern and coastal marginal agricultural zones and Uganda. An early depletion of household food stocks, coupled with rising market prices due to limited market supplies, restricted food access for many vulnerable households.\n\nThe drought was particularly harsh for pastoralists, who were still recovering from the severe livelihood asset losses (e.g. animal herds) incurred during the 2017 drought. Below-average rangeland conditions resulted in poor livestock body conditions, atypical livestock movements and related resource-based conflicts, and limited milk availability for pastoral households.\n\nIn October 2019, widespread flooding affected nearly 3.4 million people throughout the region (OCHA, January 2020), aggravating the effects of the recurrent drought and instability in the region by causing population displacements, livelihood disruption, and increased humanitarian needs. South Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia were the most affected, while Kenya and Uganda experienced landslides as well as flooding.\n\nConflict/insecurity Armed conflicts, violent extremism, intercommunal violence and other localized tensions continued to affect peace and security across the whole region. It constituted the primary driver of acute food insecurity for 8.5 million people in two countries: South Sudan and among refugee populations in Uganda who have fled from conflict-affected neighbouring countries.\n\nEfforts have been made to promote peace and security in the region and the United Nations Secretary General approved a Comprehensive Regional Prevention Strategy for the Horn of Africa in May 2019 (Office of the Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa, July 2019). The implementation of the peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea has taken a positive trend and ushered in a new era of peace and cooperation between the two countries.\n\nHowever, progress towards implementation of the South Sudan peace agreement remained slow and the situation was still volatile, with frequent episodes of intercommunal violence.\n\nAl-Shabaab still posed a threat to peace and stability in Somalia and the wider region. Cross-border conflicts continued to manifest in Mandera, where Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia meet (UNDP, July 2019), and Karamoja (Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan and Uganda), mainly driven by cattle rustling and disputes over access to water and pasture. According to ACLED data, the number of battles across the IGAD region fell from 3 500 with 7 700 fatalities in 2018, to 1 500 with 3 600 fatalities in 2019. The number of civilian fatalities remained the same at 2 200 (ACLED, accessed April, 2020).\n\nConflicts have reduced communities' resilience capacities, disrupted food value chains, led to loss of human and animal\n\nFigure 22 Total number of people (millions) in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above), 2018 vs 2019\n\n8.1\n\n6.1 6.2 6.2\n\n2.6 2.7\n\n1.1\n\n8.0 7.0\n\n5.9 5.9\n\n3.1 2.1\n\n1.5\n\nETHIOPIA SOUTH SUDAN SUDAN KENYA SOMALIA UGANDA 2.01 1.84 1.79 2.18\n\n1.73\n\n0.67\n\n3.24\n\n2.31 0.98\n\n1.03\n\n1.15 1.35 1.34 1.07\n\n1.24\n\n0.40\n\n0.50\n\n0.48 0.55 0.47 0.27\n\n0.37 1.88\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\n5.0\n\n5.5\n\nAp r-N ov 20\n\nDe c 2\n\n01 5-J un 20\n\nAu g-D ec 20\n\nMa rch\n\n20 18\n\nAu g 2\n\n01 8\n\nMa y-A ug 20\n\nSe p-O ct 2 01\n\nSe p 2\n\n01 9-A pr 20\n\nThere was a slight increase in acute food insecurity levels, mainly due to weather-related shocks in Kenya and a confluence of weather and conflict shocks in South Sudan\n\n2018-2019 lives, increased dependency on aid, and forced many people to move to safer locations, abandoning their livelihoods and social ties.\n\nEconomic shocks Economic shocks were the primary driver of acute food insecurity for 5.9 million people in the Sudan, where the economic crisis worsened in 2019. Strong inflationary pressures, the sharp currency depreciation that dampened private consumption and deterred investment (Economist Intelligence Unit, January 2020) and contraction of GDP, coupled with sanctions and shortages, pushed up fuel prices to exceptionally high levels. Prices of cereals, which started to surge in October 2017, were at record highs by the end of 2019. (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019). Some 58 percent of households were estimated to be unable to afford the local food basket (WFP, 2019). Notably, in Khartoum state, the number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) almost doubled between 2018 and 2019, indicating increasingly severe food access constraints for market-dependent urban households.\n\nEthiopia and South Sudan also faced severe macroeconomic challenges that resulted in extremely high food prices.\n\nDisplacement At the end of 2019, there were over 4 million refugees and asylum seekers in the IGAD region. Some 300 000 of the region's refugees were newly arrived, seeking protection during the 2019 year. Around half of the refugees and asylum seekers originated from South Sudan, followed by Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Sudan and Eritrea. An even higher number (7.6 million) were internally displaced with the highest number in Somalia.\n\nAccording to UNHCR's mid-year trends East and Horn of Africa hosted 21 percent of the world's refugees.\n\nUganda hosts the third largest number of refugees globally, and the highest number in the Greater Horn of Africa region (UNHCR, accessed January 2020). In 2019, persistent armed conflict, inter-ethnic violence and limited access to basic social services drove over 190 000 additional refugees and asylum seekers to seek refuge in the country, mainly from South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, increasing the overall refugee population to almost 1.4 million by the end of December 2019 (UNHCR, accessed January 2020). The Sudan hosted the fifth largest number of refugees in the world with around 1.1 million, mainly from South Sudan. See figure 23.\n\nAcross the region, around 81 percent of refugees were women and children below 18 years of age, considered the most vulnerable to protection-related risks. Some countries - particularly Ethiopia and the Sudan - have high numbers of IDPs, but are also hosting refugees or asylum seekers.\n\nThe refugee population remains heavily dependent on humanitarian food assistance to meet its minimum food and nutrition needs, but funding shortfalls have forced ration cuts in food and non-food assistance in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and the Sudan. Rations do not always cover the recommended 2 100 kcal per person per day, and from time to time are missing food commodities such as sugar, salt and fortified foods. In addition, as a result of funding shortfalls, UNHCR was unable to provide adequate supplies of non-food assistance, which resulted in shortfalls in the supply of firewood for cooking, water containers, soap, latrine access and adequate shelters in some of the refugee sites in the region.\n\nNutrition Approximately 13.5 million children under 5 years of age (almost 1 in 3 children) were stunted across the region, with 'very high' numbers in Ethiopia, the Sudan and Uganda. These children would likely not reach their full growth and developmental potential because of irreversible physical and cognitive damage caused by persistent nutritional deprivations at an early age.\n\nThe levels of acute malnutrition remained high across the region, with an estimated 9.5 million children suffering from acute malnutrition in six countries in 2019, including around 2 million with life-threatening severe acute malnutrition. The highest numbers were in Ethiopia and the Sudan. See figure 24.\n\nSome areas in these countries frequently recorded very high (>15 percent) levels of GAM. Lean season increases in life-threatening severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in children under 5 years persisted in areas of all six countries.\n\nThe key contributing factors to the high rates of malnutrition in the IGAD countries in 2019 include poor IYCF practices - in particular the low proportion of children who receive a diverse diet between the ages of 6-24 months, see figure 25; lack of sufficient quantity of food; lack of access to adequate safe water and sanitation facilities; and diseases outbreaks. Acute malnutrition rates among refugees in the region were concerning in the overwhelming majority of surveyed camps in Ethiopia, the Sudan and South Sudan (SENS). Child nutrition had improved in camps in Uganda following resumption of full rations since 2018.\n\nThe Greater Karamoja Cluster encompasses the south-western parts of Ethiopia, north-western Kenya, the south-eastern parts of South Sudan and north-eastern Uganda. Pastoralism is the principal source of livelihood. Livestock transhumance is the key strategy employed by pastoralists and agropastoralist communities to cope with shocks and seasonal events.\n\nDespite the ongoing efforts by IGAD and national governments, the cluster remains among the poorest and most acutely food insecure of the region. This cross-border region has the lowest social development indicators and the worst access to services when compared with national averages for each country. Although livestock represents the most important source of income and food for communities, the area is poorly integrated into national livestock health monitoring systems and market routes. In addition, frequent and persistent droughts are a recurrent feature of the area and their impact is exacerbated by advancing desertification and environmental degradation of rangelands.\n\nChanging borders within states have contributed to tensions and restricted the mobility of pastoral communities. In addition, extreme climatic events have worsened intercommunal conflicts, increasing disputes over already scarce natural resources, straining pastoralists' ability to move their herds beyond their communities' own lands. For these reasons, pastoralists have become heavily armed to protect their herds as well as their communities.\n\nFragility in cross-border areas in Greater Karamoja\n\n© W FP/M ARW A AW AD\n\nThe Greater Karamoja cross-border region has particularly low social development indicators and poor access to services when compared with national averages for Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan and Uganda.\n\nEast Africa's regional organization - IGAD The Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) in Eastern Africa is a Regional Economic Community of eight countries: Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, the Sudan and Uganda.\n\nIt was created in 1996 to supersede the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD), which was founded in 1986 to mitigate the effects of the recurring severe droughts and other natural disasters that resulted in widespread famine, ecological degradation and economic hardship in the region, such as during the Great African Famine of 1982-84.\n\nThe founding leaders of IGAD were motivated by a vision where the people of the region would develop a regional identity, live in peace and enjoy a safe environment, alleviating poverty through appropriate and effective sustainable development programmes. The IGAD Secretariat as the executive body of the Authority was given the mandate to achieve this goal. Source: IGAD Regional Strategy - the Framework, vol. 1, January 2016\n\nIn 2019 over 30 million people in 11 countries of Southern Africa - Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, the United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe - faced Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) levels of acute food insecurity. See figure 26.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo was one of the world's worst food crises in 2019. It has experienced decades of armed conflict and displacement coupled with very high levels of poverty, weak political and economic governance, bad roads, lack of electricity, poor health, water and sanitation services, low agriculture productivity and limited access to cultivable land.\n\nThe total figure for the region is not comparable with that of 2018 (23.3 million) which did not include data for Angola, Namibia or the United Republic of Tanzania, which in 2019 accounted for 2 million acutely food-insecure people. However, the analyses do show a grave deterioration in the acute food insecurity situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zimbabwe and Zambia.\n\nWeather extremes Southern Africa is experiencing the brunt of the climate crisis, see figure 27: it is warming at about twice the global rate and many countries were buffeted by multiple weather shocks in 2019 (OCHA, November 2019). The region has had only two favourable agricultural seasons since 2012 and many areas have yet to fully recover from the devastating impact of the 2015-2016 El Niño (WFP, UNICEF and FAO, 2019). In 2019 Angola, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe declared states of emergency due to drought.\n\nAt the start of the year dry conditions affected staple food production across Angola, Lesotho, southern Mozambique, northern Namibia, central South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Meanwhile in Malawi, flooding in Chikwawa led to loss of crops. Two tropical cyclones in Madagascar and Tropical Storm Desmond in Mozambique caused flooding and displacement (OCHA, February 2019). Then in March and April 2019, the region was hit by two consecutive tropical cyclones, Idai and Kenneth, that left a trail of death, damage and destruction in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. This was the first time in recorded history that two cyclones struck the coast of Mozambique in such close succession, and the furthest north that a cyclone had ever made landfall in the country. Overall, the cyclones and floods affected\n\nSouthern Africa in 11 countries in Southern Africa were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above)\n\n30M people 2019\n\n23% of the global number of people facing Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) were in Southern Africa\n\nMalawi ZambiaZimbabwe of the people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) across Southern Africa were in four countries 80%\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo 3.3M in 11 countries in the Southern Africa were in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) 2019\n\n15.6M 2.3M3.6M 44.4M people\n\nThe number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) increased by 7 million due to the addition of 3 countries and a worsening situation in others\n\nAngola Democratic Republic of the Congo Eswatini Lesotho Madagascar Malawi Mozambique Namibia United Republic of Tanzania Zambia Zimbabwe an estimated 3.8 million people. They occurred during the main harvest, destroying hundreds of thousands of acres of crops (OCHA, July 2019).\n\nSouthern parts of Zambia experienced the poorest rainfall season since 1981, which sharply reduced cereal crop production, leading to an increase in food import requirements (FAO-GIEWS, September 2019).\n\nPoor livestock body conditions and adverse weather triggered an increase in disease outbreaks among animals, leading to movement restrictions, which further curbed food availability, and lowered potential earnings for agricultural households (IAPRI, 2019).\n\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo flooding, crop pests and below-average rains all disrupted the main season food crop production, which was forecast below the previous five years, limiting market supplies and prompting an early start to the lean season in northern, central-eastern and south-eastern provinces (FAO and GIEWS, September 2019).\n\nEconomic shocks and weather extremes In 2019, Zimbabwe experienced its worst hunger crisis in a decade. The country has only experienced normal rainfall in one of the last five growing seasons. At the same time it faced an economic crisis characterized by acute foreign exchange shortages, hyperinflation, lack of fuel and prolonged power outages that crippled industry and work opportunities (WFP, December 2019). Extreme poverty was estimated to have risen from 29 percent in 2018 to 34 percent in 2019, which equates to 5.7 million people (WB, October 2019).\n\nAfter flooding and landslides associated with Cyclone Idai caused severe damages to crop and agriculture infrastructure in March (OCHA, August 2019), the country then experienced its worst drought in decades, with temperatures hitting 50 degrees Celsius in some areas (WFP, January 2020).\n\nThe 2018/19 national maize production was over 40 percent below the five-year average (FAO-GIEWS, October 2019), severely depleting the country's strategic grain reserve. Data from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe indicated that food prices increased by 640 percent from February-December 2019. In Zambia, steep food price hikes, combined with lower incomes, sharply reduced households' financial access to food.\n\nConflict/insecurity Although armed conflict diminished in some areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2019, it intensified in others, especially in the eastern areas of North Kivu, South Kivu and Ituri (ACLED, December 2019). Violence - around half of it against civilians - included inter-ethnic and intercommunal conflicts, and clashes between multiple armed groups that attacked and obliterated villages, destroying fields and harvests\n\nSADC - The South African Development Community\n\nThe Southern African Development Community (SADC) is an inter-governmental organization comprising 16 Southern Africa countries, namely Angola, Botswana, Comoros, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, the United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n\nIts objectives are to achieve economic development, growth, peace and security, alleviate poverty, enhance the standard and quality of life of the peoples of Southern Africa, and support an increased regional integration between member countries. For more information on SADC: https://www.sadc.int/ and stealing herds (FEWS NET, December 2019).\n\nConflict severely hindered the response to the Ebola outbreak and the number of cases increased dramatically from March 2019, making it the world's second largest Ebola epidemic on record. The outbreak disrupted agricultural activities and limited people's access to their livelihoods (FEWS NET, April 2019).\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo's vast IDP population (at 4.5 million, including almost a million forced to abandon their homes and livelihoods in 2019, it is the largest in Africa) as well as over 527 000 refugees from Burundi, the Central African Republic, Rwanda and South Sudan (UNHCR, January 2020) were among the most acutely food insecure. Other vulnerable people include 2.1 million returnees, people living in conflict-active zones or in areas hosting large numbers of displaced people. See figure 28.\n\nArmed violence in Mozambique's northern-most province of Cabo Delgado continued to force people to abandon their homes, crops, livelihoods and assets and prevent humanitarian organizations from reaching those in need and local populations from accessing basic services (ICRC, December 2019).\n\nNutrition Across the region, drought and floods increased the rates of communicable disease outbreaks, a main driver of malnutrition. In 2019, there were cholera outbreaks in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, the United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe and measles outbreaks in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Lesotho.\n\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, some 3.4 million children under 5 years were acutely malnourished, of whom 1.1 million are affected by SAM.\n\nAs figure 29 shows, across the region children under 5 years tended to have diets that lacked essential nutrients - particularly in Zambia and Zimbabwe. Chronic malnutrition rates were particularly high in the United Republic of Tanzania, Mozambique, Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, see figure 30.\n\nFigure 29 Percentage of children under 5 years who consume a minimally diverse diet for growth and development\n\nFigure 30 Percentage of children under 5 years who are chronically malnourished (stunted)\n\nUNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA\n\nMOZAMBIQUE\n\nMADAGASCAR\n\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO\n\nMALAWI\n\nZAMBIA\n\nLESOTHO\n\nANGOLA\n\nESWATINI\n\nZIMBABWE\n\n45% 43%\n\n42% 42%\n\n37% 35%\n\n30% 34.5%\n\n26%\n\n24%\n\n59%\n\n33%\n\n28%\n\n25% 25%\n\n19%\n\n17%\n\n12%\n\nSource: FSIN, based on data extracted from national nutrition surveys, DHS and MICS.\n\nSource: FSIN, based on data extracted from DHS, MICS and VAC.\n\nMore than 12.3 million people in 15 countries analysed were estimated to be in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) in West Africa and the Sahel, and Cameroon during the 2019 peak. The highest numbers were in northern Nigeria (5.0 million), Cameroon (1.4 million), the Niger (1.4 million) and Burkina Faso (1.2 million). Around 48 million were classified in Stressed (CH Phase 2) with minimally adequate food consumption and unable to afford some essential non-food items without resorting to harmful coping strategies. They were likely to slip into a higher phase of acute food insecurity if they faced an additional shock or stressor.\n\nThe overall number of people facing Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) throughout the region increased by 10 percent from 11.2 million people requiring food assistance in 2018. In Burkina Faso, Cameroon and the Niger, acute food insecurity worsened primarily because of increasing violence and insecurity. Cameroon, in particular, faced almost a trebling of the number of people in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above), from 0.5 to 1.4 million people. The crisis in Burkina Faso escalated rapidly in 2019. Although acute food insecurity was considerable in March- May 2019 with 420 000 people in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above), it increased to almost 688 000 during the pre-harvest period from June-August 2019 (RPCA, October 2019) and to 1.2 million at the end of the year. The figure represents a fourfold increase in the number of people in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) since October-December 2018 (CILSS-CH, November 2018).\n\nAround 29 percent of the total number of people in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) in the region were in the three states of north-eastern Nigeria (Borno, Yobe and Adamawa). Inaccessible areas in north-eastern Nigeria were also likely experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (REACH, June 2019, ECHO, November 2019) but could not be classified within the CH protocols because they were not accessible for enumerators to gather data.\n\nIn the Sahel region, around 5.2 million people were in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) across nine countries - Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Chad, the Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mauritania,\n\nWest Africa and the Sahel, and Cameroon in 15 countries analysed in the region were in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above)\n\n12M people 2019\n\n1.6M in 7 countries 10.3M in 6 countries 0.4M in 2 countries\n\nBurkina Faso Cabo Verde Cameroon Chad Côte d'Ivoire Gambia Guinea Guinea-Bissau Liberia Mali Mauritania Niger Nigeria Senegal Sierra Leone\n\nSource: CILSS-Cadre Harmonisé analyses, regional concertation meeting, Niamey, the Niger, March 2019.

The level of acute food insecurity in the Sahel was 3 percent higher than in 2018 when pastoralist areas were affected by prolonged dry spells compounded by conflict and insecurity.\n\nConflict/insecurity Conflict/insecurity was the primary driver of acute food insecurity for 10.3 million people in six countries across the region (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, the Niger and northern Nigeria). See figure 31 on page 37. Insecurity led to massive displacement of populations, destruction or closure of basic social services, disruption of productive activities, markets and trade flows. In particular, continuous insecurity in conflict-affected areas, associated with renewed attacks, looting, banditry and border closure measures, affected market functioning and hindered access to fields and to pastoral transhumance routes, incurring severe consequences for food security.\n\nThere were two major hotspots: The Lake Chad Basin (see figure 32) - made of sub-national areas in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and the Niger - and the Central Sahel crisis, which affected Burkina Faso, Mali and the Niger. In 2019, Burkina Faso was one of the world's fastest growing crises with the daily lives and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of civilians disrupted by insecurity and violence in central and northern regions. In December 2018, a state of emergency was declared in several provinces of Burkina Faso (WB, October 2019).\n\nIn 2019, the West Africa and Sahel region hosted around 1.2 million refugees and 4.4 million people were internally displaced. Between late 2018 and the end of 2019, the number of IDPs in the Central Sahel countries increased dramatically because of insecurity - by 300 percent in the Niger's regions of Tahoua and Tillabéry, by 66 percent in Mali and by 1 270 percent in Burkina Faso.\n\nDespite humanitarian assistance, the food and nutrition situation of IDPs and refugees remained a major concern due to limited resources, continued displacement and limited humanitarian access. More than a third, or 262 000 people living in IDP camps in nine local government areas (LGAs) in Borno state, Nigeria, were in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above); similarly, 17 000 of the 70 000 Malian refugees in five official camps in the Niger were in need of increased urgent assistance (RPCA-CILSS, 2019).\n\nWeather extremes Weather extremes also played a critical role in shaping the food security situation in the region, mostly in tandem with the effects of conflict and insecurity. They were the principal drivers of acute food insecurity in Cabo Verde, Côte d'Ivoire, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania and Senegal, where a total of 1.6 million people were in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above). See figure 31 on page 37.\n\nRecurrent shocks, such as localized deficits in cereal and forage production due to drought or floods, have eroded people's coping capacities.\n\nIn 2019, floods and heavy rains damaged crops in several areas in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, Mauritania, the Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone. Dry spells led to cereal production deficits in Cabo Verde and to fodder deficits in Mauritania and Senegal, as well as in Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali and the Niger, which disrupted the transhumance patterns of pastoralists and led to a concentration of livestock in some non conflict-affected areas of the four countries, increasing the risk of intercommunal tensions (RPCA, November 2019).\n\nSignificant production shortfalls were expected in Cabo Verde, the Gambia, the Niger and Sierra Leone. In Guinea and GuineaBissau, a combination of dry spells and floods affected food security.\n\nEconomic shocks Economic shocks were the main drivers of acute food insecurity in Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the national currencies depreciated by 22 percent and 10 percent respectively compared to 2018 levels (CILSS, November 2019). Weather extremes, insecurity and below-average crop production also contributed to economic decline in other countries. Year-on-year inflation rates in 2019 were above 10 percent in Liberia (30.9 percent) Sierra Leone (15.2 percent) and Nigeria (11.6 percent), and close to 10 percent in Guinea (9.4 percent) and the Gambia (7.6 percent). Cereal prices were generally lower than 2018 and the five-year average as supply was greater than demand across most of the sub-region. However, insecurity and market disruption in conflictaffected areas, such as the Lake Chad Basin and Liptako-Gourma pushed up food prices (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019).\n\nNutrition The nutrition situation remained alarming throughout many areas in the region as insecurity exacerbated pre-existing drivers of malnutrition by, for instance, forcing the closure of health centres. Lack of dietary diversity for children under 5 years old was extremely concerning in some countries of the region, particularly in the Niger and Chad. See figure 34.\n\nWhile there was a slight decrease in the prevalence of acute malnutrition in some areas of the Niger and north-eastern Nigeria, the GAM rate exceeded the 'very high' threshold (>15 percent) in some areas of Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali and Mauritania. In Burkina Faso, nearly 466 000 children under 5 years were acutely malnourished, 133 000 severely so. In Mali, 660 000 were acutely malnourished, 160 000 severely so. Chronic malnutrition rates were 'high' in Burkino Faso, Mali and Cameroon and 'very high' in Chad, Nigeria and the Niger, where they reached 46 percent. See figure 35.\n\nIn recent years, acute food insecurity has increased significantly in cross-border areas. Although cross-border dynamics in food crises are largely context-specific, there are some common vulnerabilities.\n\nPoverty and acute food insecurity levels are higher in the Central Sahel (e.g. in areas covered by l'Autorité de Développement Intégré du Liptako-Gourma [ALG]) and the Lake Chad Basin border areas than they are in other parts of those countries. Local populations are largely engaged in agriculture and pastoralism, and in the case of the Lake Chad Basin, fishing, and are therefore highly dependent on dwindling natural resources. The increased intensity and frequency of climatic shocks - such as recurring droughts in the Central Sahel - are further degrading natural assets (e.g. cropland, water resources, pastures) and generating increased competition over those resources, thereby increasing the risk of intercommunal violence, for example between pastoralist groups and farmers.\n\nThe Central Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin are also characterized by a lack of presence of State systems, including limited access to basic services, the absence of security forces and administrative authorities, and limited border control. These limitations are particularly applicable to pastoralist communities, who are under-represented in local public institutions (FAO, forthcoming).\n\nThe combination of these factors makes pastoral communities particularly vulnerable. On the one hand, this is due to the mobile nature of their livelihoods, which constrains access to basic services; on the other, the degradation of natural resources not only disrupts their normal transhumance routes, but it also impoverishes their livelihoods.\n\nArmed groups and transnational organized criminal gangs have also profited from the absence of State control, limited border control and marginalized local populations, enabling them to operate in multiple countries, disrupt regional trade, or impose their rule on communities. Since 2017, insecurity and armed groups have spread from the north and centre of Mali across the borders of the Liptako-Gourma areas into the Niger and Burkina Faso, with civilians often the victims of violence and displacement widespread, particularly in Burkina Faso. Insecurity has also severely disrupted regional trade, notably in the Sahel regions of Burkina Faso, Mopti in Mali, and Tillabéri in the Niger (RPCA, 2019).\n\nThe limited presence of the State in the Lake Chad Basin has facilitated the rise of violent activity by Boko Haram or Boko Haram-affiliated armed groups since 2014. Armed groups benefit from fluid borders to engage in criminality, banditry and attacks against communities across state lines, leading to a growing tide of refugee and internally displaced populations and placing additional pressure on the food security status of both host and displaced communities. The persistent insecurity in the Lake Chad Basin, in addition to border closures in Nigeria, have also affected trade in the region, contributing to higher food prices and limited access to markets in certain regions (RPCA, 2019). Violence has inhibited humanitarian access to vulnerable populations in both the Central Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin, (FAO-GIEWS, 2019).\n\nFigure 36 Number of people (millions) in CH Phase 2 or above in 2014-2019, sub-national areas covered by ALG in Burkina Faso, Mali and the Niger\n\n- Crisis 4 - Emergency 5 - Catastrophe2 - Stressed 3\n\nSource: CILSS-Cadre Harmonisé\n\nFEB-MAY 2014 JUN-AUG 2014 OCT_DEC 2014 MAR-MAY 2015 JUN-AUG 2015 OCT-DEC 2015 MAR-MAY 2016 JUN_AUG 2016 OCT-DEC 2016 MAR-MAY 2017 JUN-AUG 2017 OCT-DEC 2017 MAR-MAY 2018 JUN-AUG 2018 OCT-DEC 2018 MAR-MAY 2019 JUN-AUG 2019 OCT-DEC 2019\n\n7.5\n\n0 4.17 4.64 1.62 3.96 3.50 2.94 4.453.83 4.48 4.66 5.65 5.57\n\n0.03\n\n2.033.02\n\n0.04\n\n2.72 2.972.12 2.38\n\n1.39\n\n0.26\n\n0.44\n\n0.99 0.09 1.38\n\n0.12\n\n0.70 0.04\n\n0.99 0.03 1.43\n\n0.07\n\n1.98\n\n0.93 0.80 0.33 0.01 0.002 0.003\n\n0.01\n\n0.44 0.41\n\n0.26 0.46\n\n0.86 0.35 0.01\n\n0.92 0.14\n\nFragility in border areas in West Africa and the Sahel\n\nWest African regional organizations\n\nThe Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control (CILSS) is a regional organization, consisting of 13 countries in the Sahel region. Its objectives are to invest in research for food security and the fight against the effects of drought and desertification in the Sahel. The 13 countries are Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Chad, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, Mauritania, the Niger, Senegal and Togo. It facilitates the consistent use of the Cadre Harmonisé (CH) by 18 countries in West Africa and the Sahel (its member states, members of the regional Food Crisis Prevention Network (RPCA) and Cameroon) to prevent food crises by quickly identifying affected populations and proffering appropriate measures to improve their food and nutrition security.\n\nThe Réseau de Prévention des Crises Alimentaires (RPCA) is an international consultation and coordination platform co-ordinated by the CILSS drawing on the political leadership of the Communauté Economique Des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (CEDEAO or ECOWAS) and Union Economique et Monétaire Ouest Africaine (UEMOA) Commissions, and includes all CILSS countries, plus Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. As an open forum for discussion and information-sharing, the network analyses the food and nutritional situation of the region, and promotes consistent and concerted action.\n\nCEDEAO itself is made up of 15 member countries that have both cultural and geopolitical ties and shared common economic interest. The countries are: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Côte d'Ivoire, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, the Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo.\n\nUEMOA consists of countries that have the CFA Franc in common. Its member states are Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, the Niger, Senegal and Togo.\n\nThe G5 Sahel is a joint regional force, bringing together Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, the Niger and Chad, and supported by the African Union and the United Nations.\n\nCreated in February 2014, this regional force aims at improving the coordination of the countries at a regional level for development policies and security and defence activities. It aims especially at fighting the terrorist threat, starting with the securitization of borders area.\n\nThe Autorité de Développement Intégré de la Région du Liptako Gourma (ALG) or Liptako-Gourma Authority is a regional organization seeking to develop the contiguous areas of Mali, Burkina Faso and the Niger. in 15 member countries of CEDEAO in 13 member countries of CILSS in 5 countries of the G5 Sahel in 7 member countries of UEMOA in sub-national areas covered by the ALG in 3 member countries 9.7M 5.6M 4.6M 4.0M 2.0M\n\nNumber of people in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) in 2019 by regional organizations\n\nAbout 43 million people were estimated to be acutely food insecure and in need of urgent assistance across 10 countries in the Middle East and South/South East Asia in 2019.\n\nYemen remained the world's gravest food crisis in 2019. High acute food insecurity levels persisted in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar, Palestine, the Syrian Arab Republic, Yemen and among Syrian refugees in Turkey in 2019, with slight improvements in the situation in Iraq and Lebanon. While the numbers of acutely foodinsecure people increased in Afghanistan and Pakistan's Sindh and Balochistan provinces, this was mainly linked with the higher analysis coverage in 2019. See figure 38.\n\nConflict/insecurity Protracted armed conflict and violence, frequently fuelled by political, social and economic grievances or geopolitical tensions remained the main drivers of acute food insecurity across the region (OCHA, December 2019). See figure 37.\n\nIn Yemen, although violence abated in the critical port city of Hodeida following the 2018 Stockholm Agreement, conflict increased in other areas and fighting continued across 10 out of 22 governorates. The protracted conflict continued to severely disrupt economic activity, damage infrastructure, destroy basic public services (WB, October 2019) and to restrict access to markets and services (ACAPS, October 2019).\n\nNine years into the crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic the scale and complexity of humanitarian needs and protection concerns remained high. In the north-east, increased conflict since the onset of the Turkish-led military offensive in October 2019 resulted in civilian deaths and significant displacement (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nFighting in Afghanistan continued, prompting the displacement of over 400 000 people in the first 10 months (OCHA, December 2019). From July-September the number of civilian casualties was the highest since 2009 (UNAMA, October 2019).\n\nIn Iraq, the formal conclusion of major military operations against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in late 2017 paved the way for millions of displaced Iraqis to return home. But intercommunal and societal tensions persisted on multiple fronts and the spectre of armed conflict and renewed displacement lingered (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nAsia and the Middle East\n\nConflict/insecurity Weather extremes\n\n3M in 1 country\n\n40M in 9 countries\n\nAfghanistan Bangladesh (Cox's Bazar) Iraq Lebanon (Syrian refugees) Myanmar Palestine Pakistan (Balochistan and Sindh) Syrian Arab Republic Turkey (Syrian refugees) Yemen\n\nIn Gaza, the ongoing blockade, combined with regular flare-ups of hostilities, affected all aspects of civilian life and threatened to ignite a wider confrontation (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nHumanitarian organizations in the region faced multiple challenges that obstructed their access to populations in need of assistance. The operating environment in Yemen has become one of the most non-permissive in the world. At least 5.1 million people in 75 hard-to-reach districts have been cut off from humanitarian assistance by restrictions imposed by authorities (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nIn Iraq, widespread protests and insecurity had significant impacts on humanitarian operations. Intermittent curfews were imposed in Baghdad and the southern governorates, resulting in missions being delayed or cancelled. In Ninewa, United Nations agencies and NGOs were unable to carry out relief activities in camps because of delays in getting approvals and access letters (OCHA, November 2019).\n\nViolations of international humanitarian law, including attacks on health and education facilities, continued to make Afghanistan one of the most dangerous countries in the world for aid agencies to operate (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nEconomic decline The economic decline and lack of sustainable livelihoods that accompany protracted conflict have exhausted individual and community coping mechanisms. In Yemen, acute shortages of foreign exchange and collapse in government revenues have interrupted the purchase of essential imports and payment of public sector salaries and pensions (WB, October 2019). Around two in five Yemeni households have lost their primary source of income and find it difficult to buy even the minimum amount of food (WB, October 2019).\n\nThe depreciation of the Syrian Pound against the USD, high unemployment, low salaries, high competition for labour opportunities and escalating food prices curtailed Syrians' purchasing power (WFP, 2020).\n\nIn Afghanistan, poverty increased, with more than 80 percent of people living on less than USD 1.90 per day (OCHA, December 2019). In Gaza, unemployment increased in the second quarter of 2019, with youth unemployment at 64 percent, the highest in the world. Nearly half the population was living below the poverty line (WB, September 2019). In the Syrian Arab Republic households' purchasing power was limited by high unemployment, low salaries, high competition for labour opportunities and rising food prices (CFSAM, September 2019).\n\nIn Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh, more Rohingya refugee and host community families were running up debts (REVA, 2019) with about 80 percent of refugee households in debt (UNHCR/WFP, October 2019). Many in the host community have lost access to farmed lands and work opportunities and were facing a sharp drop in daily wages due to the increased supply of unskilled labour (JRP, March 2020).\n\nWeather extremes Some countries in the region also experienced extreme climate events in 2019. In Sindh province of Pakistan, the 2018 monsoon season rains were almost 70 percent below average and in Balochistan they were 45 percent below average, resulting in acute shortages of water, food and fodder into 2019.\n\nIn Afghanistan, some households had still not fully recovered their lost livelihood assets following the 2018 drought (FEWS NET, October 2019), while hundreds of thousands were affected by seasonal floods across almost all provinces (OCHA, December 2019). In September, Cox's Bazar experienced heavy monsoon rains that triggered serious landslides and flooding.\n\nIn Iraq, heavy March/April rains caused flooding in central and southern governorates that caused temporary displacement and disrupted clean water supplies in some areas (OCHA, May 2019).\n\nIn the Syrian Arab Republic, Hasakah Governorate faced the worst flooding in a decade (IFRC, April 2019) following heavy rains in late March, affecting vulnerable IDPs and causing damage to homes and agricultural land (IFRC, April 2019). High temperatures and strong winds caused fires on standing crops before harvesting time (CFSAM, September 2019).\n\nDisplacement The scale of displacement across the region is staggering. Around 30 million have been displaced (UNHCR, UNRWA, IOM), many of them multiple times, either internally or as refugees to neighbouring countries. See figure 39.\n\nIn the Syrian Arab Republic alone, an estimated 6.1 million people were internally displaced with around 1 million of them living in last-resort IDP sites, many of which are over-crowded and lack adequate essential services, including water and sanitation. At least 6.8 million have sought safety abroad as registered refugees in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt (UNHCR midyear trends 2019). Turkey alone hosted 18 percent of the world's refugees and the refugee population increased by 5.8 percent in 2018 (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nIn Yemen, around 4 million civilians have been displaced, including 375 000 during 2019 alone (UNHCR). Even countries with large numbers of internally displaced people, such as Yemen, the Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq, are also hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees and asylum seekers from countries in the region.\n\nRefugees and IDPs - as well as returns of both - often settle in urban centres, straining basic services, increasing competition for scarce labour opportunities and reducing daily wages for the hosts by providing cheaper competition. This is a concern in Afghanistan, Iraq, the countries hosting Syrian refugees and Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district.\n\nNutrition Millions of children under the age of 5 across the Middle East and South Asia are acutely malnourished and in need of urgent nutrition assistance. For instance, in Yemen 2 million children aged 6-59 months were acutely malnourished, 400 000 of them severely so. In Afghanistan, the number of acutely malnourished children under 5 years of age increased by 25 percent from 2018 to an estimated 2.5 million children in 2019. Of them, 690 000 were severely malnourished and in need of life-saving treatment.\n\nChronic malnutrition rates among children were also above the 'very high' threshold in Yemen, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. See figure 41.\n\nConflict has contributed to pre-existing child malnutrition by lowering access to nutritious food (see figure 40), forcing displaced people to live in over-crowded conditions, destroying health services and increasing disease outbreaks.\n\nIn May 2019, an estimated 10.1 million people (40 percent of the population) were in need of food assistance. Only 7 percent of surveyed households had an acceptable diet that included a more frequent intake of high-protein foods and fruits. The other 93 percent with poor and borderline food consumption had a daily diet that was insufficient in diversity and nutrients.\n\nThe situation was expected to further deteriorate during the lean season from May to September 2019 unless urgent humanitarian action was taken (FAO/WFP, May 2019).\n\nThe main drivers were prolonged dry spells, abnormally high temperatures and floods that severely reduced the 2018 main season cereal production (mostly rice and maize). The early season wheat, potato and barley crops, harvested in June and important to fill food gaps during the lean season, were affected by low snow cover, which exposed crops to freezing temperatures, limited water availability and poor rains.\n\nSanctions-related shortages of fuel, electricity and lack of spare parts for agricultural equipment also contributed to pushing the aggregate 2018/19 cereal production to well below the previous five-year average. Post-harvest losses were higher than usual due to fuel and electricity shortages that hampered the timely transport and processing of crops as well as the ventilation of stocks. For the 2018/19 marketing year, the uncovered cereal deficit was estimated at about 1.36 million tonnes (FAO/WFP, May 2019).\n\nLimited arable land (only 15 percent of the largely mountainous country is suitable for cultivation) and lack of irrigation also curtail domestic production (WFP, November 2019). The Government continues to rely on international humanitarian assistance, which is challenged by lack of funding as well as by lack of banking channels for in-country operational costs (UNRC, March 2019).\n\nThe population relies on the Public Distribution System (PDS) and any reduction in the entitlements affects food security nationwide (UNRC, March 2019). From January 2019, rations reduced to 300 grammes per person per day, a 21 percent fall compared to the same period in 2018 and was far from the 2019 target of 550 grammes. Further reductions were expected until September when the main crops would be available (FAO/WFP, May 2019).\n\nPDS households had to rely on markets and kinship support to fill the food gap. WFP's regular market monitoring surveys found a general trend of increasing market prices in early 2019 compared to 2018, which was likely to cause further stress on people's access to food and worsen overall food consumption (FAO/WFP, May 2019).\n\nFood insecurity and malnutrition are strongly interrelated. Diet diversity is inadequate and particularly young children and pregnant and lactating women suffer from chronic malnutrition because their diets lack vitamins, minerals, proteins and fats (UNRC, March 2019).\n\nThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea\n\n© W FP/JAM ES BELGRAVE\n\nFarmers busy preparing land before planting the maize crop in Sinchon County, South Hwanghae province. Dry spells, high temperatures and floods severely hampered production in a country with high reliance on manual labour and little irrigation.\n\nDisclaimer: The GRFC team acknowledges that there are notable limitations to the use of the Rapid Food Security Assessment to estimate the population in need according to IPC Phases. The estimate relies on one indicator, specifically the Food Consumption Score, and the population in need was determined to be equivalent to the population reporting a Poor Food Consumption Score. The data was purposively sampled and consisted of 179 households, 125 of whom were surveyed in November 2018 and 54 of whom were surveyed in early 2019. For this reason this figure has not been included in the total figure (135 million) or in the chapter 2 table.\n\nThe major food crises in Latin America and the Caribbean are the four countries of the Central America Dry Corridor (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua), Haiti, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and Venezuelan migrant populations living in Colombia and Ecuador. In 2019, 18.5 million people in these countries were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above), representing 14 percent of the global population living in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above).\n\nHalf of these people were in Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of). Around 9.3 million Venezuelans were acutely food insecure and in need of assistance according to WFP's Emergency Food Security Assessment carried out in July-September 2019. Of these, 2.4 million, were considered severely food insecure and 7 million moderately food insecure (WFP, February 2020). Another 1.2 million Venezuelan migrants were acutely food-insecure in Colombia and Ecuador.\n\nWhen considering the areas analysed in both 2018 and 2019 rounds in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, the number of food-insecure people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) increased from 2.7 million (15 percent of the population analysed) in 2018 to 3.2 million (18 percent) in 2019. The number of areas classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) increased from 4 to 13 in 2019, with Guatemala and Honduras seeing the most significant deterioration since 2018.\n\nHaiti has seen an increase of almost 600 000 acutely foodinsecure people in need of urgent assistance in rural areas since the same period a year earlier, including an increase of more than 100 000 in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). Around 3.7 million people were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) - 35 percent of the population analysed - from October 2019-February 2020.\n\nEconomic shocks Economic shocks formed the main driver of acute food insecurity for 14.1 million people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) in four countries. See figure 42. Although Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) possesses the world's largest oil reserves, 2019 marked the fifth consecutive year of deep recession for its economy. See figure 43. Food prices soared by more than 8 000 percent in 2019, wiping out Venezuelans' purchasing power (Banco Central de Venezuela, 2019). The high cost of agricultural inputs and general lack of them - reflecting the depreciation of\n\nLatin America and the Caribbean in 8 countries of the region were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above)\n\n18.5M people 2019\n\n14% of the global number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) were in Latin American and the Caribbean of people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) across the region were in Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)\n\nOver 50%\n\nVenezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)\n\n9.3M in 7 countries in the region were in Stressed (IPC Phase 2)\n\n2019 28M people\n\nColombia Ecuador El Salvador Guatemala Haiti Honduras Nicaragua Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) the currency and import difficulties - led to a reduction in the planted area and expected below-average maize harvest (OCHA, November 2019). Consequently, reliance on imported food increased, but with dwindling foreign exchange earnings, food shortages became increasingly pressing.\n\nIn Haiti, the political and socioeconomic crisis was the primary driver of worsening acute food insecurity in 2019. The resignation of the former Government in March led to a slowdown or halt of public services and suspension of bilateral investment and support, while the depreciation of the Haitian Gourde triggered high inflation and record or near record high food prices. Urban unemployment soared and the most vulnerable households in rural areas lacked agricultural work opportunities.\n\nVulnerable households and smallholders in the Dry Corridor area were also affected by poor economic conditions and reduced purchasing power. Low international coffee prices as well as increases in input costs severely affected production and the incomes of the 1.3 million producers and pickers who rely on the sector for their livelihoods across the region. High beans and maize prices had a dire impact on poor households that spend a high proportion of their total expenditure on food. In April, WFP found that among its beneficiaries in the Central American Dry Corridor (CADC) 25 percent of households had insufficient cash to purchase the minimum food basket (WFP, 2019).\n\nWeather extremes The world's second-most disaster-prone region, Latin America and the Caribbean is feeling the impact of climate change, with stronger seasonal hurricanes in the Atlantic and recurring climate shocks in Central America compounding socioeconomic vulnerabilities and economic inequity (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nIn 2019, acute food insecurity in the Dry Corridor was primarily driven by drought, which adversely affected subsistence maize and beans farmers, small coffee farmers and agricultural labourers who had not yet fully recovered from the severe 2018 drought and five years of erratic seasonal weather patterns. The drought was severe in eastern El Salvador, most of Guatemala, central, eastern and southern Honduras, and central and northern Nicaragua. Aggregate maize crop production was forecast at 1.7 million tonnes below average in Guatemala, 0.47 million below in Honduras and 0.36 million below in Nicaragua (FAO-GIEWS, October-December 2019).\n\nThe Caribbean region comprises many small island developing states (SIDS) that are especially susceptible to a wide range of natural hazards - including droughts, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and landslides - which cause an estimated USD 3 billion in annual losses. With climate change expected to increase the intensity of extreme weather events, Caribbean countries are faced with formidable challenges in protecting people, livelihoods and infrastructure and in maintaining their economic, social and environmental gains (WFP, 2019).\n\nCentral American Dry Corridor, IPC Acute food insecurity situation (based on 2019 peak data by country)\n\nSource: IPC Technical Working Groups: El Salvador (April-July 2019), Guatemala (March-June 2019), Honduras (November 2019-February 2020) The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.\n\nInadequate evidence\n\nNot analysed\n\nHaiti stands out as the country where the impact of weather events and natural disasters have had the strongest impact on food security in the three previous years. El-Niño induced rainfall deficits contributed to a 12 percent fall in 2019/2020 aggregate cereal production since the previous year (IPC, October 2019).\n\nDisplacement Since the start of the crisis in 2015, in Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) some 4.8 million Venezuelans (15 percent of the total population) have fled the country as refugees and migrants, making it the second largest displacement crisis in the world after the Syrian Arab Republic. By the end of 2019, 3.9 million were in Latin America and the Caribbean, including 1.6 million in Colombia, 862 000 in Peru and 385 000 in Ecuador (IOM, December 2019; UNHCR, December 2019).\n\nThe majority of Venezuelan migrants and refugees have poor or limited access to food, forcing them to adopt coping strategies to deal with a lack of food. Additional visa restrictions have also adversely affected migrants' revenue-generating capacities.\n\nA combination of sociopolitical unrest, food insecurity, increasing poverty, a lack of economic opportunities and widespread human rights violations perpetrated by criminal gangs spurred the number of refugees and asylum-seekers from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to reach around 387 000 in 2019. Many have been displaced more than once within their own countries or have been deported back home, often into dangerous situations.\n\nPolitical turmoil in Nicaragua since April 2018 also compelled thousands of people to flee violence and human rights violations in 2019, the majority into neighbouring Costa Rica (UNHCR, accessed 17 February 2020).\n\nM A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1

Badakhshan, Balkh, Herat, Kabul and Nangarhar were estimated to have the highest numbers of acutely food-insecure populations in need of urgent assistance.\n\nFACTORS DRIVING ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY\n\nConflict/insecurity From July-September the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) documented a record-high number of civilian casualties, mostly caused by anti-government elements. From August to mid-October, there was a further uptick in conflict, with the largest number of events near Kabul, Helmand and Kunduz provinces (FEWS NET, October 2019).\n\nConflict and insecurity continued to displace people, with over 400 000 fleeing their homes in the first 10 months of 2019 across 32 out of 34 provinces (OCHA, December 2019). Those displaced in areas of temporary conflict were likely to return home to rebuild their livelihoods, including agricultural production, but those displaced in areas of frequent conflict faced a longer period\n\nBACKGROUND In 2020, Afghanistan enters its 40th year of a conflict that 'shapes all aspects of everyday life' (OCHA, December 2019). In 2019 civilian casualties reached a record high (UNAMA, October 2019). The conflict has had a devastating impact on the country's development. A quarter of the labour force is unemployed and over half (54.5 percent) live below the national poverty line (WB, October 2019). Political uncertainty, poverty, escalating personal debt and repeated exposure to natural disasters have eroded coping capacities, pushing vulnerable people into dire humanitarian need (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW Over a third (37 percent) of the population, or 11.3 million people, were forecast to be in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) from November 2019-March 2020.1 Of them, 8.6 million people were forecast to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and nearly 2.7 million in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). In addition, around 9.45 million were expected to be in Stressed (IPC Phase 2). Six provinces - Ghor, Nimroz, Badakhshan, Daykundi, Nuristan and Uruzgan - were\n\nFEWS NET's analysis of available evidence suggests the population requiring emergency food assistance in 2019 was lower than the IPC estimate.

Many of the displaced accumulate debts that take years to pay off (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nDuring 2019, about half a million Afghan refugees returned, mainly from Iran (430 000), followed by Pakistan and other countries (OCHA, December 2019). Voluntary repatriation was down by 49 percent compared to 2018, to just 8 000 returnees (UNHCR).\n\nDespite generally favourable livestock conditions in the third quarter of the year, in some areas conflict made pastureland inaccessible and prevented farmers from accessing their fields to prepare for winter wheat planting (FEWS NET, October 2019).\n\nEconomic shocks Sustainable, paid employment is scarce and 80 percent rely on self-employment, daily labour or unpaid work. A quarter of the labour force is unemployed (WB, October 2019). Returnees (mainly from Iran) compete with residents for work, leading to labour supply further outstripping demand and depressing daily wage rates (OCHA, December 2019). Remittances from Iran were below average due to worsening economic conditions there.\n\nCasual labour opportunities were below the five-year average because of lower demand in construction and other industrial sectors (FEWS NET, June 2019). Daily wage labour rates were below the two-year average, leading to an overall decrease in household purchasing power (FEWS NET, October 2019).\n\nAccording to the Seasonal Food Security Assessment, of the 63 percent of households that claimed to have experienced shocks, 29 percent referred to loss of employment, 25 percent reduced income and 9 percent increased food prices (FSAC, September 2019).\n\nIn May, inflation rates reached almost 5 percent and the food component of the Consumer Price Index increased to 7 percent - but returned to 2 percent in September 2019. Following the Government of Pakistan's ban on wheat and wheat flour exports, wheat grain prices increased in all markets in July-August 2019. Prices differed between provinces with wheat grain costing 25 percent more in Kandahar than in Herat (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019).\n\nThe Whole of Afghanistan Assessment shows the financial situation of displaced people worsens over the first two years of displacement. It is only after an average of two years that IDP households begin to reduce their overall debt, but they still fall short of ever recovering to a pre-displacement debt level (REACH, September 2019).\n\nWeather extremes Nationwide, some households had not fully recovered their lost livelihood assets following the 2018 drought (FEWS NET, October 2019). Despite average to above-average livestock prices, purchasing power was below average for pastoral and agropastoral households across wealth groups because of below-normal herd sizes following livestock losses (FEWS NET, Source: Afghanistan IPC Technical Working Group, October 2018. The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.\n\nAfghanistan, IPC Acute food insecurity situation, November 2018-February 2019\n\nOctober 2019). However above-average precipitation improved pasture availability for livestock in most rangelands (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019).\n\nThe number of people affected by seasonal floods was unusually high in 2019, reaching 300 000 in 32 out of 34 provinces (OCHA, December 2019). However, the floods had minimal impact on the national 2019 cereal harvest (FEWS NET, June 2019), which was one-third above that of the 2018 drought-reduced harvest and 7 percent above the five-year average. Winter wheat planting was expected to be above average due to abundant rains (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW The number of acutely malnourished children under 5 years of age increased by 25 percent since 2018 to an estimated 2.5 million children, with 690 000 of them being severely malnourished and in need of life-saving treatment. The findings of the most recent nutrition surveys across the country show that 25 out of 34 provinces (Kapisa, Wardak, Nangarhar, Laghman, Bamyan, Paktika, Paktia, Kunar, Nuristan, Badakhshan, Takhar, Kunduz, Samangan, Balkh, Sar-e-Pol, Ghor, Daykundi, Uruzgan, Zabul, Jawzjan, Faryab, Helmand, Badghis, Herat, Farah) had an under 5 wasting prevalence above emergency thresholds (>15 percent) (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nRapid nutrition assessments in IDP settlements found 'high' child wasting levels at 11-13 percent in Badghis, and close to 11 percent in Herat (ANC, July 2019). Population displacement and poor water and sanitation conditions trigger disease, particularly diarrhoea, and raise the risk of malnutrition. Around 563 000 PLW were under-nourished (OCHA, December 2019). The overwhelming majority (92 percent) of rural women faced problems accessing health care services, with distance and cost the major barriers (DHS 2015).\n\nDrivers for malnutrition include sub-optimal childcare and feeding practices, poor access to health services, sanitation and safe water, acute food insecurity and the negative impact of conflict-related shocks. Only 16 percent of children aged 6-23 months receive the minimum acceptable diet for their development with around half receiving an adequate number of meals, and only 24 percent a nutritionally diverse diet (at least four food groups) (DHS 2015). Outbreaks of measles and the Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever continued to affect most provinces. Afghanistan remains one of the last countries yet to have eradicated polio (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nSource: Afghanistan IPC Technical Working Group, November 2019.

In addition, over 193 000 were in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) conditions and required action for disaster risk reduction and to preserve livelihoods (IPC, October 2019).1\n\nFourteen communes out of 24 were classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) mainly in the municipios of Cahama, Cuangar, Cuanhama, Gambos/ex-Chiange, Ombadja and Quilengues. The remainder were all classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), even though four communes in Cuangar and Cuchi had more than one in two inhabitants facing Crisis conditions or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) (Bondo, Kutato) rising to more than two in three inhabitants in the Chinguanja and Cuchi communes (IPC, October 2019).\n\nThis constituted a 33 percent increase in the numbers of people in need of urgent food assistance compared with July- September 2019, when approximately 422 000 were food insecure and required urgent action in the 24 communes.\n\nThis analysis was conducted with minimal support from IPC Global Support Unit. 1\n\nBACKGROUND During the 27-year civil war, which ended in 2002, many people moved to cities, which shifted the country from a primarily agrarian economy to a net food importer. Angola's mainly rain-fed, small-scale subsistence farming leave it particularly vulnerable to increased temperatures and rainfall variability (USAID, October 2018) and even minor dry spells may lead to acute food insecurity (JRC-GDO, October 2019). Domestic cereal production covers about 60 percent of needs (FAO-GIEWS, October 2019). Despite the end of the war almost two decades ago, Angola still has around 105 square kilometres contaminated by landmines (Government of Angola, August 2019), which is an impediment to sustainable socio-economic development, particularly in the agriculture sector, in the affected areas (SIPRI, November 2019).\n\nSmallholder farmers from Huambo and Huila provinces deliver fruit and vegetables to a wholesale market in the drought-stricken province of Cunene in southern Angola. By December, the drought had affected 857 000 people and around 72 000 stock animals had died in Cunene.\n\nDuring that period almost 222 000 people were in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). A higher number were classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) (267 000 people) compared with the projected period of October 2019-February 2020 (IPC, October 2019).\n\nAcute food insecurity among refugees Following the outbreak of violence in the Kasai region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in March 2017, around 35 000 refugees arrived in Angola's Lunda Norte province. Their repatriation was underway in 2019, but was interrupted between September and October at the request of the Congolese government (UNHCR, November 2019).\n\nAs of late September some 14 800 Congolese refugees had been repatriated (Government of Angola, September 2019). By the end of November the country still hosted around 45 000 refugees, including 12 000 Congolese (UNHCR, December 2019).\n\nThe food consumption status of refugees in Lovua settlement improved between April and July 2019. By July the percentage of refugee households with inadequate food consumption had fallen to 40 percent from 62 percent in April. Over 90 percent were reducing meal portion sizes and 80 percent reducing the number of meals they consumed each day to cope with food shortages (WFP, July 2019).\n\nWeather extremes In early 2019 erratic and below-average rainfall negatively affected crop yields - particularly of maize - at the national level. Vegetation stress was reported over the east-west belt (JRC-GDO, October 2019). Pest infestations (fall armyworm and birds) also contributed to low maize yields (IPC, October 2019). As a result, the 2019 cereal output was estimated at 16 percent below the favourable harvest of a year earlier and 9 percent below the five-year average (FAO-GIEWS, October 2019). In some areas agricultural campaigns failed completely. Millet and sorghum production declined significantly and livestock herd sizes decreased (IPC, October 2019). The 2019/2020 cereal import requirements increased to meet the deficit of 1.2 million metric tonnes (SADC, July 2019) with maize imports 15 percent above average.\n\nThe three southern provinces of Cuando Cubango, Cunene and Huila, which produce a minor share of the national cereal production, were severely affected by drought. Given the severe dry conditions, livestock body conditions deteriorated as a result of poor pasture and water availability (FAO-GIEWS, October 2019), and local populations faced loss of assets, displacements and significantly disrupted livelihoods (IPC, October 2019). By December the drought had affected over Source: Angola IPC Technical Working Group, October 2019. The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.\n\nAngola, IPC Acute food insecurity situation, October 2019-February 2020\n\n857 000 people and one million cattle. Around 72 000 animals, including cattle, goats and pigs, had died as a result of dry conditions and poor animal health in Cunene (Government of Angola, December 2019). It also destroyed agricultural fields (Government of Angola, November 2019), and reduced households' resilience in a context of recurrent shocks, as it spurred many to adopt extreme coping mechanisms, including taking children out of education to work (Government of Angola, September 2019).\n\nEconomic shocks The national currency depreciated by 54 percent against the USD between January 2018 and March 2019 due to the implementation of a floating exchange rate (IMF, June 2019). Although over the past two years year-on-year the inflation rate decreased, it remained high at 17 percent in July 2019 because of weak economic activity and exchange rate depreciation (WB, 2020). In October, maize flour prices were 19 percent higher than their levels a year earlier in Luanda, and 38 percent higher than two years earlier, while cassava flour prices were 9 percent above their October 2018 levels and 25 percent above their 2017 levels (FAO-GIEWS, January 2020). In the provinces affected by drought, shortages in staples led to a steep rise in food prices in the main markets, further limiting food access, which was already hampered by the poor state of road infrastructure (IPC, October 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW An estimated 464 500 children under 5 years old were affected by acute malnutrition and 1.7 million by chronic malnutrition in 2019 (VAC, July 2019). Acute malnutrition prevalence increased from 5.9 percent in 2015-16 to 8.2 percent in 2019, considered a 'medium' prevalence, with an additional 333 000 children wasted. The increased levels of acute food insecurity are likely driving the increasing levels of acute malnutrition. Meanwhile, rates of chronic malnutrition fell from 37.6 percent in 2015-16 to 29.9 percent in 2019, which is classified as a 'high' prevalence.\n\nPoor child-feeding practices are also contributing to malnutrition. In 2015-16 only 13.3 percent of children aged 6-23 months consumed a minimum acceptable diet required for their growth and development, while only one out of three children had acceptable dietary diversity. Just 37.5 percent of infants were exclusively breastfed (IIMS, 2015-16).\n\nA total of 71 vaccine-induced polio (cVPDV2) cases were found in Angola in 2019 (WHO, December 2019), and Capunda municipality in Malanje province reported 11 deaths related to measles (Government of Angola, October 2019). A small number (19) of cholera / AWD cases were confirmed in the first part of 2019 (UNICEF, May 2019).\n\nB A N G L A D E S H ( C O X ' S B A Z A R ) | M A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9\n\nPopulation analysed 3.5M (100% of total population, including displaced people) JOINT RESPONSE PLAN FOR ROHINGYA HUM ANITARIAN CRISIS JAN-DEC 2019\n\nTotal population in Cox's Bazar district 2.7M plus 915 000 refugees\n\nW PR\n\nBangladesh (Cox's Bazar and host populations)\n\nThere was no change in the number of Rohingya refugees and members of the host community who were acutely food insecure and in need of urgent food assistance.\n\nThe majority of the Rohingya refugees currently residing in Cox's Bazar are expected to remain in 2020 and dependence on external aid will likely continue.\n\nUNHCR DEC 2019\n\nENH VCA ROUND 4, 2019\n\nENH VCA ROUND 4, 2019 ENA R2 2018 UNHCR 2019\n\n1.3M Food-insecure people in need of assistance in January-December 2019\n\nThere were 915 000 Rohingya refugees/Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals under the joint Government-UNHCR registration exercise as of 31 December 2019.\n\nThis figure was released after the completion of the JRP 2020 process, which used a planning figure of 855 000 persons.\n\nThe refugees live in 34 extremely congested camps formally designated by the Government of Bangladesh in Ukhiya and Teknaf Upazilas of Cox's Bazar district.\n\n4As the root causes of the conflict in Myanmar have not been addressed Rohingya refugees remain displaced in Cox's Bazar and reliant on food assistance.\n\n4Limited income earning opportunities continued to compel refugees to resort to unsustainable coping mechanisms.\n\n4Refugees have depleted their savings; daily labour wages are low and they are increasingly falling into a cycle of debt.\n\n4Incidents of tension and violence have been observed, both within the camps and between refugees and host communities.\n\n4Bangladeshi host communities have lost access to previously farmed lands and casual labour opportunities due to competition with cheaper refugee labour.\n\n4Refugees live in highly challenging circumstances, exposed to cyclic climatic shocks resulting in soil erosion, slope failure, storms and damaged or destroyed shelters.\n\n4Early marriage and poor infant and caring practices drive malnutrition alongside poor sanitation and hygiene and high levels of water contamination.\n\nNUTRITION INDICATORS 37.1-41.6% of children under 5 years and 20.2-31.8% of women 15-49 years are anaemic. 12.6% of children 6-23 months in the makeshift settlements and 37.4% in Nayapara camp meet the minimum dietary diversity requirement.\n\n50% of children under 6 months in the makeshift camps and 74% in Nayapara are exclusively breastfed.\n\n48 300 children under 5 years are acutely malnourished, of whom 3 900 are affected by SAM.\n\n32.6-39% of children under 5 years are stunted.\n\nRefugee population\n\nM A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9 | B A N G L A D E S H ( C O X ' S B A Z A R )\n\n© W FP/NIHAB RAHM AN BANGLADESH ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW In 2019, 1.3 million people were food insecure and in need of humanitarian food and livelihood assistance in Cox's Bazar district of Bangladesh. Around two thirds of them were Rohingya refugees (855 000) in Ukhiya and Teknaf upazilas and 444 000 were members of the Bangladeshi host community (JRP, March 2020).\n\nAccording to the latest Refugee influx Emergency Vulnerability Assessment, the percentage of refugee households with inadequate food consumption remained unchanged at 42 percent (REVA 3, 2019) compared to 44 percent in November 2018 (REVA 2, 2018). Around 94 percent of refugees were entirely dependent on assistance to help them meet their minimum essential needs (REVA 3, 2019).\n\nBuying food on credit, borrowing money to buy food and selling off humanitarian assistance continued to be the most adopted coping strategies to support consumption in 2019 (REVA 3, 2019). Half of refugee households were buying food on credit or borrowing money to buy food, a reduction from 58 percent in 2018 (REVA 3, 2019) - although this decrease could be due to people losing their credit worthiness.\n\nThe most vulnerable included unregistered refugees who arrived in the camps prior to the influx, newly-arrived\n\nBACKGROUND Between August and December 2017, about 750 000 Rohingya nationals crossed into Bangladesh following a major offensive against them in Rakhine state, Myanmar. They joined about 169 000 refugees already living in camps in Cox ́s Bazar. Kutupalong and Nayapara registered camps and the makeshift camps have become the world's largest refugee settlements. The influx exacerbated an already-fragile situation, overwhelming infrastructures for health, education and WASH. Two years on the situation has improved thanks largely to assistance provided by the Government and humanitarian community and resilience of the Rohingya. But socio-economic challenges, such as poverty and constrained self-reliance opportunities, raise serious food security concerns (UNHCR/WFP, October 2019).\n\nA Rohingya refugee girl in Cox's Bazar stands outside shelters damaged by floods during September's heavy monsoon rains that triggered landslides, flash flooding and renewed displacement. refugees, large families with fewer adults potentially involved in income generation, single parents and child-headed households, especially if they had to support vulnerable household members, such as disabled persons (REVA 2, 2018 and UNHCR/WFP, October 2019).\n\nThe food security situation among the host community improved between 2018 (REVA 2, 2018) and 2019 (REVA 3, 2019) as the percentage of households with inadequate food consumption dropped from 30 percent to 21 percent and utilization of consumption-based coping strategies remained low. The share of households that purchased food on credit and/or were borrowing money to buy food halved from around 45-50 percent in 2018 to 25 percent in 2019 - although again, this seeming improvement could be attributed to people losing their credit worthiness.\n\nDRIVERS OF ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY\n\nConflict/insecurity Despite progress, the stateless Rohingya still face an extremely precarious future as the root causes of the conflict in Myanmar have not been addressed (OCHA, accessed January 2020).\n\nIn 2018 UNHCR, UNDP and the Government of Myanmar signed an agreement to create conditions conducive to their return (JRP, January 2019). But until these refugees/ Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals are given citizenship in Myanmar and officially recognized and accepted as one of many ethnic groups in the country with the same rights as all Myanmar nationals, they will remain as refugees in the camps in Cox ́s Bazar and compelled to rely upon government support and humanitarian aid (UNHCR/ WFP, October 2019).\n\nIncidents of tension and violence have been observed, both in camps and between refugees and host communities, exacerbated by congested conditions in the camps and limited opportunities for education and skills development. Relocations and displacement related to weather hazards, inter-community tensions and new arrivals increased the need for rapid food assistance (JRP, January 2019).\n\nEconomic shocks Displacement from Myanmar has almost tripled the total population in Ukhiya and Teknaf Upazilas, with profound consequences for the Bangladeshi residents. While the rapid population increase has brought economic opportunities to segments of the local population, the influx has led to higher inflation and a sharp drop in daily wages due to the increased supply of unskilled labour (JRP, January 2019).\n\nThe food and nutrition security of the poorest among the host community is a growing concern. Many have lost access to previously farmed land/forest and have lost work opportunities to the cheaper refugee labour market.

About 70 percent of households borrowed money (or food) from other refugees in the camp and about 80 percent were in debt.\n\nThe REVA 2 identified a looming risk of getting stuck in a vicious circle of indebtedness (UNHCR/WFP, October 2019). Credit dependency remains high in both Rohingya and host communities. Six out of 10 Rohingya households and 4 out of 10 host community households had contracted debts, three months prior to the survey in December 2019. The vicious cycles of debt remain high; 9 out of 10 Rohingya households that had contracted debts were yet to repay at the time of the survey (REVA 3, 2019).\n\nAccording to surveys conducted with 1 034 Rohingya refugees in 30 camps in April 2019, there was a 15 percent increase in the percentage of respondents reporting that people in their community sold aid items - mainly food - to meet their need for cash (59 percent). Food was also named as the most common purchase when using money from selling aid (Ground Truth solutions, June 2019). This practice of selling aid items persisted towards the end of the year with around half of refugee households continuing to do so (REVA 3, 2019).\n\nWeather extremes Although they have access to the basics, refugees are still extremely vulnerable, living in highly challenging circumstances, exposed to the monsoon elements (OCHA, accessed January 2020).\n\nBy mid-year, 50 500 refugees had been affected by soil erosion, slope failure, wind, storms and rain, with over 6 000 temporarily displaced to family, friends and collective centres inside the camps while the floodwaters receded and shelters could be re-established (JRP, June 2019). In early September, Cox's Bazar experienced 200-300mm of rain, which triggered serious landslides and flash flooding, particularly in the lowlying regions of Teknaf sub-district. Following the flooding the restricted telecommunications services and decreased mobile and internet signal hampered the emergency response, including the delivery of critical, life-saving healthcare services (ISCG, October 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW According to the 2020 JRP, 76 000 people are in need of essential curative nutrition services (JRP, March 2020).\n\nThe acute malnutrition rates in Nayapara, Kutupalong and makeshift camps are classified as 'high'. The findings indicated a decline in Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) in makeshift camps from 19.3 percent in 2017 to 10.9 percent in 2019. The prevalence was 12.1 percent in Kutupalong camp and 13.3 percent in Nayapara. Stunting was slightly lower, but remained very high in makeshift camps (32.6 percent) compared to Nayapara and Kutupalong (35.4-39 percent) (SMART, October 2019).\n\nAnaemia levels among children age 6-59 months were 'severe' in Kutupalong camp, at 41.6 percent. In the other camps anaemia levels among children of this age group were 'moderate' ranging from 37.1-39.4 percent. For women of reproductive age anaemia was 'moderate' ranging from 20.2-31.8 percent (SMART, 2019).\n\nIn the two weeks before the September/October nutrition surveys over 25 percent of children aged 6-59 months had had diarrhoea in the makeshift and Nayapara camps (SMART, October 2019). While 84 percent of children had received measles vaccinations in Kutupalong camp, the rate dropped to 76 percent in Nayapara and 25 percent in makeshift camps (SMART, October 2019).\n\nSafe sanitation, hygiene, and solid waste management are inadequate and inequitable: only 69 percent of refugees had access to functional latrines, with space availability remaining the core constraint (JRP, June 2019). Open defecation remained common practice for children under 5 years.

Conflict cut off humanitarian access to some camps and IDP hosting areas, particularly in the Centre-Nord and Sahel regions.\n\nBACKGROUND In December 2018, a state of emergency was declared in several provinces of Burkina Faso (WB, October 2019). In 2019, the humanitarian situation was one of the world's fastest growing crises with the daily lives and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of civilians disrupted by insecurity and violence in central and northern regions.\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW In October-December 2019, over 1.2 million people were in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above), including about 28 400 people in Emergency (CH Phase 4) in Centre-Nord and Sahel provinces. The largest numbers were in the Sahel, Nord, Est and Centre-Nord regions, particularly in the areas of Bam, Sanmatenga, and Soum (CILSS-CH, November 2019). The figure represents a fourfold increase in the number of people in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) since October- December 2018 (CILSS-CH, November 2018).\n\nThe escalation of the crisis is particularly concerning when considering the rate at which it advanced throughout the year. Although acute food insecurity was considerable in March- May 2019 with 420 000 in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above), it increased to almost 688 000 during the pre-harvest period from June-August 2019 (RPCA, 2018-2019) and to 1.2 million at the end of the year. A further 3.6 million people were classified in Stressed (CH Phase 2) during that period.\n\nAcute food insecurity among refugees Burkina Faso hosts more than 23 000 Malian refugees who live in and around two consolidated camps in the Sahel region. The prolonged crisis and increased insecurity in Mali, in most of the return zones, prevents a return in safety and dignity. At the same time, security in the Sahel region is rapidly deteriorating and there is a possibility that Malian refugees will spontaneously relocate to safer areas.\n\nRefugee acute food insecurity deteriorated significantly between 2018 and 2019 with the percentage of households with inadequate food consumption increasing from 20 percent in 2018 to 38 percent in 2019 (WFP, 2019).\n\nConflict/insecurity The security situation deteriorated as violence spread from the northern regions to eastern parts. A state of emergency in 14 provinces - declared in December 2018 - was extended until January 2020 (ACAPS, December 2019).\n\nThe number of violent incidents in 2019 was almost three times higher than in 2018, while reported civilian deaths in the first half of the year were four times higher than the total for 2018 (ACLED, January 2020). The severity of the conflict contributed to the displacement of 560 000 people as of December 2019, up from 47 000 in January (UNHCR, December 2019). In conflict-affected areas, agricultural activities decreased by 20-70 percent, while land cultivation dropped by 50 percent compared to 2017-2018. Difficulties in accessing fields, the destruction of production infrastructure, and looting and loss of livestock disrupted market functioning and households' livelihoods (FAO, October 2019).\n\nConsequently, displaced populations faced a major deficit in the quality and quantity of food consumption since they were unable to resort to other coping or adaptation strategies (RPCA, November 2019). Conflict cut off humanitarian access to a number of camp areas and IDP-hosting areas, particularly in the Sahel region, where a large number of IDPs and the majority of Malian refugees were located (UNHCR, May 2019).\n\nEconomic shocks Conflict constrained access to markets in the Sahel region and vulnerable households were obliged to rely on host communities and humanitarian assistance (AVI, November 2019). Insecurity disrupted normal livestock market functioning (RPCA, November 2019), particularly in northern regions. However, livestock prices remained stable or declined by 5-10 percent relative to the average (FEWS NET, November 2019). Although weak cereal prices ensured favourable terms of trade for livestock owners as of November 2019, a rapid deterioration was forecast in areas suffering from limited fodder resources due to insecurity (RPCA, November 2019).\n\nIncomes from cash crop production and sales were expected to remain below average because of localized declines in production (FEWS NET, December 2019).\n\nSource: CILSS-Cadre Harmonisé, March 2019.

Fodder deficits were estimated at between 1 320 and 1 350 tonnes in all regions except for the Sud-Ouest (FSC, November 2019). Reports of restricted mobility of animal herds and concentration of animals in more secure regions could increase the risk of conflict between pastoralists and other livelihood groups (RPCA, November 2019). In areas leastaffected by insecurity, the growing season was favourable and the late 2019 harvests were expected to be above the five-year average (FEWS NET, December 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW Nationally in 2018, 8.5 percent of children aged 6-59 months were wasted, 1.7 percent severely so, reaching 13 percent ('high') in the Sahel region. The national prevalence of stunting was 'medium' at 25 percent (MoH, December 2018).\n\nPreliminary results of the national SMART survey carried out in 2019 show high levels of acute malnutrition in Sanguié (Centre Ouest region), Boulgou (Centre Est region) and Séno (Sahel region). Out of the 33 provinces analysed, 27 showed a 'high' or 'very high' prevalence of stunting, with Séno and\n\nYagha provinces (Sahel region) reporting a prevalence above 40 percent (45 percent and 48 percent respectively). An estimated 465 800 children aged 6-59 months were acutely malnourished, 133 100 severely so and in need of nutrition prevention and treatment programmes (OCHA, July 2019).\n\nResults from a rapid SMART survey conducted in November 2019 in areas most affected by violence and insecurity (Sahel, Nord, Centre Nord and Est regions) found a deteriorating nutrition situation among children and women in communities with high concentrations of displaced people. The acute malnutrition prevalence in children aged 6-59 months was above 10 percent in most municipalities surveyed. The prevalence was 'very high' in Barsalogho and Djibo at around 17 percent. A 'high' prevalence exceeding 10 percent was observed among pregnant and breastfeeding women in the communes of Matiacoali and Kaya, as well as at the Barsalogho host site. Overall, the situation was most concerning among IDPs (FEWS NET, December 2019).\n\nBy November 2019, 71 health centres had been closed, while services in 75 others had been impaired by insecurity and armed attacks. This left some 881 000 people with limited or no access to health care (OCHA, November 2019).\n\nAcute malnutrition in Mentao and Goudebou camps was below 10 percent (8.5 percent and 7 percent respectively). Chronic malnutrition ranged from 32-36 percent in the two camps while anaemia was of significant public health concern, at over 63 percent in both camps (SENS 2017).\n\nC A M E R O O N | M A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9\n\n950 300 Cameroonians were internally displaced, up by one third since late 2018, with a huge increase in Oct 2019.\n\nThere were 416 200 refugees and asylum seekers, mainly from Central African Republic (72%) and Nigeria (27%).16 700 refugees arrived in 2019 but the increase rate was slower than in previous years.\n\nThere were 347 900 Cameroonian IDP returnees.\n\nCameroon\n\nAcute food insecurity levels rose sharply in North-West and South-West regions and remained concerning in the Far North.\n\nThe number of people in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) is expected to almost double nationally and treble in the Far North although the geographical coverage has expanded significantly.\n\nDHS 2018 DHS 2018 DHS 2018\n\nSENS 2015/16\n\nPopulation analysed 16.1M (64% of total population, including IDPs, returnees and refugees)\n\n1.4M CH Phase 3 or above in October-December 2019\n\nCILSS-CADRE HARM ONISÉ NOVEM BER 2019\n\n3.8M CH Phase 2 Stressed CH Phase 3 Crisis CH Phase 4 Emergency 1.2M 172 000\n\n44% Rural 66% Urban\n\nTotal population of country 25M\n\nSENS/UNHCR SENS 2015/16\n\nSENS 2015/16 SENS 2015/16\n\n4Clashes in the North and South-West regions forced huge numbers to abandon their homes, crops and livelihoods.\n\n4In the Far North intensified Boko Haram related violence and insecurity prevented people from farming or working.\n\n4The acute food insecurity status of refugees from neighbouring countries worsened as humanitarian food rations shrank.\n\n4In the Far North, crops were destroyed by floods, birds and fall armyworm leading to reduced income for farmers and reduced food availability.\n\n4The drivers of acute food insecurity also inhibited child feeding practices, access to safe water, sanitation and health services to the detriment of child nutrition.\n\n57.4% of children under 5 years and 39.7% of women 15-49 years are anaemic.\n\n60% of households have access to at least basic drinking water services.\n\n10% of children 6-23 months meet the minimum acceptable diet.\n\n39.7% of children under 6 months are exclusively breastfed.\n\n4.3% of children under 5 years are acutely malnourished, of whom 1.6% are affected by SAM.\n\n28.9% of children under 5 years are stunted.\n\n31.4% of households do not consume micronutrient-rich food in Minawao camp.\n\n40-87.3% of children under 6 months in 11 camps are exclusively breastfed.\n\n17 700 children under 5 years are acutely malnourished, of whom 2 400 are affected by SAM in 11 sites.\n\n42.2-54.9% of children under 5 years in 11 camps are stunted.\n\nNUTRITION INDICATORS Host population 33.2-60% of children under 5 years in 8 camps and 24.7-62.5% of women 15-49 years in 7 camps are anaemic.\n\n6.6%-100% of households in 11 camps have access to improved drinking water sources.\n\nM A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9 | C A M E R O O N\n\n© UNHCR/XAVIER BOURGEOIS\n\nCAMEROON BACKGROUND A country endowed with rich natural resources, Cameroon enjoyed several decades of stability, but in recent years it has been grappling with attacks by armed groups in the Far North and for the past four years with a secessionist insurgency in the North-West and South-West Anglophone regions (WB, October 2019). In 2014, 24 percent of Cameroonians were living in extreme poverty (USD1.90 a day) (WB). Refugees from the Central African Republic and Nigeria are in areas already deprived of social services and development support.\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW The number of people in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) peaked at almost 1.4 million (8 percent of the population analysed) in October-December 2019 (CILSS-CH, November 2019). Over 70 percent of them (968 500) were in the Anglophone regions while around 17 percent (233 000) were in the Far North. Of the 171 700 classified in Emergency (CH Phase 4), around 89 percent were in the Anglophone regions. In addition, 3.8 million people were in Stressed (CH Phase 2).\n\nIn June-August 2019, 947 700 people were in Crisis (CH Phase 3) and at least 25 percent of the populations of Bui, Menchum, Momo and Boyo departments in the North-West Violence in Nigeria has driven well over 100 000 Nigerians across the border. A displaced woman looks out from her shelter in the Cameroonian town of Goura. and Mémé, Manyu, Lebialem and Ndian in the South-West were classified in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above).\n\nAcute food insecurity among refugees Cameroon hosts 416 200 refugees and asylum seekers, mainly from the Central African Republic (72 percent) followed by Nigeria (27 percent). In 2019 the refugee population increased by 16 700, although this marks a slower rate of increase than previous years (UNHCR, December 2019).\n\nCameroon has more Central African refugees than any other country, with 252 000 in the East and Adamaoua, where poverty levels are high. Over 70 percent live in host communities. The influx has overstretched already-weak basic services, systems and resources (OCHA, January 2019).\n\nRefugees' acute food insecurity deteriorated from 18 percent with poor food consumption in 2016 to 37 percent in 2019. Over 150 000 Central African Republic refugees were in need of food assistance, with poverty the main driver. Funding shortfalls caused a break in all food assistance, raising extreme concerns about food security in the near future (WFP, January 2019). Rural areas in Anglophone regions are often inaccessible to humanitarian agencies making it hard to assess IDPs' needs or provide them with aid (OCHA, 2019).\n\nConflict/insecurity Cameroon is experiencing the impact of three distinct, complex humanitarian crises fuelled primarily by violence and insecurity (OCHA, January 2019). In the Far North the security situation stemming from the Lake Chad Basin worsened in 2019, with the number of Boko Haram incursions increasing from 20 per month between January and August to 28 in the following three months. Communes along the border with Nigeria faced abductions, livestock theft and destruction of property (OCHA, 2019). Incursions constrained agricultural production, causing localized production shortfalls and prevented people from moving far, limiting income generation, especially in places where border trade is an important means of livelihood (FEWS NET, December 2019). By the end of the year the Far North hosted around 297 400 IDPs (IOM DTM, November 2019) and around 109 000 Nigerian refugees (UNHCR, December 2019).\n\nIn the Anglophone regions, what began as a political crisis turned into a significant, complex humanitarian emergency (OCHA, December 2019). Although the conflict diminished in intensity from September, the security situation remained precarious as clashes persisted between separatists and the national army. Roadblocks, general strikes, kidnappings, fires and destruction of property continued to impair livelihoods, prompting people to flee towards forests or urban centres. Limited access to fields and lack of maintenance of plantations diminished crop production by comparison with the pre-crisis period (FEWS NET, December 2019).\n\nBy December 2019, the Anglophone regions had 679 400 IDPs and 347 900 returnees. Stripped of their assets, livelihoods and ability to grow crops, these people could not ensure their food security without assistance from aid agencies or host households or the use of negative coping strategies (UNHCR, 2019). This displacement has strained the resources and livelihoods of the host population too.\n\nCameroon, CH Acute food insecurity situation, June-August 2019\n\nCameroon, CH Acute food insecurity situation, October-December 2019\n\nIn the Mayo Danay department in the Far North region, crops were destroyed by floods, birds and fall armyworm (CILSS-CH, 2019) leading to reduced income for farmers and reduced food availability locally (FEWS NET, November 2019). Localized floods affected over 40 000 people in Logone-et-Chary and Mayo-Danay in September-October, destroying crops and depleting stocks at the end of the lean season (OCHA, October 2019). The floods further limited humanitarian access to vulnerable populations, led to new displacements, and aggravated the already serious humanitarian situation.\n\nEconomic shocks In the North-West and South-West regions the closure of land borders curbed trade and added additional upward pressure on prices in border markets (FEWS NET, 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW Although nationally the prevalence of acute malnutrition among children aged 6-59 months was classified as 'low' (4.3 percent), it was 'high' in the Far North (10.1 percent) and Adamaoua (10.0 percent) regions (DHS 2018).\n\nNationally, stunting in children under 5 was considered 'high' (28.9 percent), reaching 'very high' levels in North (41.3 percent), Far North (37.3 percent), East (37.3 percent) and Adamaoua (34.6 percent) regions. Children in rural areas were far more likely to be chronically malnourished than in urban (36.2 percent vs. 19.8 percent). (DHS 2018).\n\nAt 40 percent, exclusive breastfeeding rates of children under 6 months were better than those of neighbouring Chad, the Niger and Nigeria, but only 1 in 10 children aged 6-23 months received the minimum acceptable diet. Child anaemia rates (57.4 percent) were a 'severe' public health issue (DHS 2018). Just 39 percent of rural Cameroonian households had access to at least basic drinking water services (UNICEF/WHO, 2017).\n\nHouseholds in many areas have limited access to health services (WHO, December 2019). In the North-East and NorthWest, attacks on medical staff and infrastructure were frequent and more than 80 percent of Government-run health facilities were closed (OCHA December 2019). By December, 1 071 cases of cholera and 1 170 suspected cases of measles had been reported (WHO, December 2019).\n\nNutrition status of refugees The wasting prevalence was 'very high' in two out of eight Central African refugee camps in the eastern regions. In the Far North, wasting was 4.2 percent among Nigerian refugees in Minawao camp and 8.2 percent among out-ofcamp refugees. Stunting was particularly concerning among children under 5 in camps (40.2 percent- 54.9 percent) as were anaemia levels (50 percent in most camps, peaking at 68 percent in Mbile camp) (SENS 2015/2016).\n\nC E N T R A L A F R I C A N R E P U B L I C | M A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9\n\n687 200 Central Africans were internally displaced.\n\nThere were 7 500 refugees, mostly from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Chad.

But some armed groups firmly opposed participating in dialogue and violence against civilians increased in several areas (OCHA 2019). The country ranks 188 out 189 in the 2019 Humanitarian Development Index (UNDP, 2019). The most recent estimates show that more than 71 percent of the population was living below the international poverty line (USD 1.90 per day) in 2018 (WB, 2019).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW Over 1.8 million people (representing 41 percent of the analysed population) were acutely food insecure and in need of urgent assistance (IPC Phase 3 or above) season from May- August. This included around 466 000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). In addition 1.8 million people were classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2).\n\nThe most-affected areas were the east and south-east prefectures of Mbomou, Haute Kotto and Haut Mbomou and five areas with a high concentration of IDPs - Bria, Kaga-Bandoro, Obo, Rafai and Zémio - which experienced\n\nTraumatized by having been imprisoned and threatened at knife and gunpoint by armed group members, including her own father, 19-year-old Fatime Ramadam now lives in an IDP shelter in Bria.\n\nEmergency conditions (IPC Phase 4). Three areas with a high concentration of IDPs (Alindao, Bambari and Batangafo) and 13 prefectures were in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Around 326 000 IDPs and host populations in high concentration areas were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above), representing 56 percent of the population analysed in these areas (IPC, June 2019).\n\nWhile the overall number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) was similar to that of 2018, the numbers were higher in Mbomou, Haut Mbomou and Haute Kotto prefectures (IPC, June 2019). In the last quarter of 2019, the food security situation was forecast to improve, but still critical for 1.6 million people in need of urgent assistance, including nearly 375 000 in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). Eight sub-prefectures in Haut Mbomou, Haute Kotto, Kémo, Ouaka and Ouham prefectures were classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and another 47 sub-prefectures in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) (IPC, November 2019).\n\nConflict/insecurity Despite the peace agreement, the level of violence and attacks only decreased temporarily throughout the country and the overall levels of violence remained worrying, with women and children among the most affected (MINUSCA, October 2019). After a decline in June and July, violence intensified in August and September, including in areas previously unaffected. Clashes in August led to the displacement of an estimated 13 000 civilians (UNSC, October 2019). Violence and armed groups hindered humanitarian access with more than 100 attacks reported between January and August (ACAPS, September 2019). As of 30 November, 687 000 people were still internally displaced, with almost two in three living among host communities (Shelter Cluster, November 2019). Basic services were dysfunctional or non-existent in many areas of the country, and people's access to livelihood opportunities severely hindered (FAO, October 2019).\n\nViolence and insecurity constrained food production because of abandonment and lack of access to fields, particularly in the eastern and south-eastern areas (IPC, June 2019). However, thanks to voluntary returns of farmers and overall adequate and well-distributed rainfall, 2019 agricultural output was estimated to be above-average - but still below pre-crisis levels. Localized production shortfalls were reported in Basse Kotto, Mbomou and Ouaka due to the activities of armed groups (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019).\n\nRaiding, theft and attacks by armed groups have devastated the livestock sector. Pastoralist mobility remained difficult in north-western areas, exacerbating tensions with farmer communities and affecting livestock herding and production (FAO, October 2019). Lack of vaccinations increased animal disease outbreaks (FAO, March 2019).\n\nSource: Central African Republic IPC Technical Working Group, June 2019.

Two in three households depended on markets for food during the lean season from May- August 2019 (IPC, June 2019). In May, cassava prices increased by 54 percent, while maize and rice increased by 19-23 percent compared to the same period in 2018 (WFP, May 2019).\n\nA bowl of cassava was six times more expensive in eastern markets than in western in September. The same month, the closure of the border between the Sudan and Vakaga and Upper Kotto prefectures in response to the hostilities had a further negative impact on trade (FEWS NET, September 2019). In November, insecurity-related supply and trade disruptions kept the prices of cassava, maize and rice 50 percent higher year-on-year (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019).\n\nReturnees, IDPs and refugees faced lack of assets and inputs to restart agriculture and cattle-rearing (IPC, November 2019).\n\nWeather extremes Delayed rainfall affected the first agricultural season and contributed to localized production shortfalls in western prefectures, the breadbasket of the country (IPC, November 2019). Flooding of the Oubangui and Ouaka rivers affected at least 57 000 people in October (FEWS NET, November 2019), and damaged crops in the prefectures of Bangui, Ombella-Ponko, Ouham, Ouaka and Basse-Kotto (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW The latest nutrition survey in 2018 found that 7 percent of children aged 6-59 months were acutely malnourished, 2.1 percent severely so. Vakaga (11.1 percent) and Basse Kotto (10.1 percent) had the highest rates of wasting, indicating a 'high' prevalence (MoH, December 2018).\n\nAccording to the most recent estimates, 178 000 children aged 6-59 months were acutely malnourished, 49 000 of them severely so. Children in IDP sites and remote rural locations with limited access to basic services were more likely to be affected by wasting. The supply chain for nutritional products is challenged by persistent insecurity in some areas in the centre and south-east (OCHA, October 2019).\n\nIn 2018, stunting among children under 5 years of age was considered 'very high' with a 37.7 percent prevalence (MoH, December 2018). An estimated 367 000 children were chronically malnourished and in need of malnutrition treatment and prevention (OCHA, October 2019).\n\nChild-feeding practices in 2018 were far from optimal with just 17.4 percent of children aged 6-23 months consuming the minimum acceptable diet required for their growth and development (MoH, December 2018).\n\nSource: Central African Republic IPC Technical Working Group, November 2019.

Of these, 22 000 were classified in Emergency (CH Phase 4) and 619 000 in Crisis (CH Phase 3), while 2.7 million (19 percent of the population analysed) were in Stressed (CH Phase 2). Out of 69 areas analysed, 11 were classified in Crisis (CH Phase 3) in the regions of Lac (four areas), Tibesti (two areas), Ennedi Est (two areas), and Borkou (two areas). Another 34 areas were classified in Stressed (CH Phase 2) (CILSS-CH, March 2019).\n\nDuring the October-December 2019 period, the number of people in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) decreased to 564 000 with the seasonal availability of the harvest from September. However, this number was 200 percent higher than the same period in 2018 (189 000) and 77 percent higher than in 2017 (318 000). The 544 000 in Crisis (CH Phase 3) and 20 000 in Emergency (CH Phase 4) during this time were mainly in the Sahelian belt (CILSS-CH, November 2019).\n\nAcute food insecurity among refugees According to UNHCR, as of 31 October 2019, the country hosted about 438 000 refugees from neighbouring countries, mainly from the Sudan, the Central African Republic and Nigeria (UNHCR, accessed 16 January 2020). This includes around 333 000 Sudanese refugees, who arrived since 2003, living in 12 camps along the border with the Sudan in eastern Chad; around 90 000 Central African refugees, who arrived since 2003, living in six camps in the south and around 12 000 Nigerian refugees from the Boko Haram insurgency living in one camp and villages in the Lake Chad region (UNHRC, October 2019).\n\nThe majority of displaced people, refugees and host communities are highly dependent on humanitarian assistance to satisfy their basic needs. However, as one of the poorest countries in the world, Chad's capacity to provide assistance is limited (ECHO, June 2019).\n\nThe acute food insecurity status of refugees remained critical and deteriorating, most notably among the Sudanese refugees from Darfur in the regions of Wadi Fira, Ouaddai, Sila and Salamat, near Chad's border with the Sudan (UNHCR, November 2019; OCHA April 2019). In Centre East, some 63.5 percent of Sudanese refugees were moderately or severely food insecure (UNHCR, February 2019 and UNHCR, December 2017). Faced with limited livelihood opportunities, refugees in the North and Centre East resorted to use of concerning negative coping strategies (in addition to foodbased strategies) including onward migration to Libya and transactional sex. In-kind and cash assistance to refugees in Chad has decreased over the past four years, often falling to only 50 percent of a ration, and was well below basic energy requirements. Only a percentage of the population\n\nChad, CH Acute food insecurity situation, June-August 2019 was targeted with food assistance. Livelihood support was extremely limited and refugee households remained reliant on food assistance to meet their needs (WFP, June 2019 and UNHCR, December 2017).\n\nConflict/insecurity Deteriorating insecurity linked to Boko Haram and military operations in the Lac region as well as increasing violence linked to militant and criminal groups in the Tibesti region (ACAPS, 2019) impeded trade flows and the movement of people and animals, degrading food availability, livelihoods and food access (FEWS NET, August 2019). In addition, insecurity forced pastoralists to stay close to cities, increasing tensions between herders and farmers.\n\nLac, Ouaddai, Sila and Tibesti regions were all under a state of emergency due to ongoing violence, preventing affected populations from accessing their livelihoods and humanitarian assistance (ACAPS, October 2019).\n\nThe protracted violence and insecurity in the Lac and Tibesti regions increased the number of internally displaced people from 165 300 at the end of 2018 to 170 300 by the end of October (UNHCR, 2019).\n\nWeather extremes While abundant rainfall in 2018 pushed the country's cereal production to 14 percent above the five-year average, improved pasture conditions (FAO-GIEWS, June 2019) and kept food prices below their five-year average, longer-thanusual dry spells and pests decreased crop production in the Sahelian belt (CILSS-CH, November 2019). In recent years recurrent drought has stressed livelihoods and made households less able to cope with and recover from any type of shock (FAO, April 2019).\n\nRains caused widespread flooding in many provinces, affecting 171 200 people by the end of October. Around half of these people were in the southern province of Mayo-Kebbi East, where torrential rains and floods caused extensive destruction of houses, loss of animals, food stocks and other assets (OCHA, November 2019).\n\nEconomic shocks In Tibesti, households' limited income, mainly from petty trade, the black market, livestock sales, remittances from migrant workers and gold panning, has fallen since the conflict started, while the cost of food in markets has remained high. A significant proportion of food in markets is imported from Libya or other parts of Chad, but trade routes have been disrupted (FEWS NET, August 2019), and the border temporarily closed (CILSS-CH, March 2019).\n\nChad, CH Acute food insecurity situation, October-December 2019\n\nIn Lac, IDP households were relying primarily on humanitarian assistance, which barely met their food needs. Income from salaried agricultural work also declined. Closed borders with Nigeria and the Niger limited access to food markets and trade (OCHA, June 2019 and FAO-GIEWS, June 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW Nationally a 'high' percentage of children suffered from GAM (12.9 percent). Of them, 2.9 percent were affected by SAM (SMART 2019). As shown in map 17, 6 provinces and 27 departments were classified in a Serious (IPC Phase 3) to Critical (IPC Phase 4) nutritional situation. Household food insecurity appeared to be a minor contributory factor among many others. Some 1.8 million children aged 6-59 months will require treatment for acute malnutrition in 2020 (IPC AMN, December 2019).\n\nIn 9 out of 23 provinces GAM prevalence was above the 'very high' threshold with the worst levels in Ennedi Est, Borkou, Barh El-Ghazel, Ennedi Ouest, Salamat and Kanem. In 12 provinces SAM prevalence was over 2 percent. The national stunting prevalence was 'very high' at 32 percent of children aged 6-59 months. Regionally, stunting levels were over 40 percent in Kanem, Mayo Kebbi Ouest and Logone Occidental (SMART, 2019).\n\nChild care and feeding practices were extremely poor. The exclusive breastfeeding rate was 17.7 percent. Only 13.3 percent of children aged 6-23 months met the minimum acceptable diet for their growth and development. Just 7.3 percent of children of this age consumed food from five or more food groups, satisfying the minimum dietary diversity. Minimum meal frequency was 37.8 percent (SMART, 2018).\n\nAnaemia affected 63.6 percent of children aged 6-59 months, indicating a 'severe' public health concern (SMART, 2019). It affected 39.8 percent of reproductive-age women, indicating a 'moderate' public health significance (SMART, 2017).\n\nNationally, only two out of five households (39 percent) had access to basic drinking water sources (UNICEF and WHO 2017) and only 15.9 percent had access to improved sanitation facilities (SMART, 2019). By the end of 2019, a measles outbreak was ongoing, with 26 623 suspected cases reported (WHO, December 2019).\n\nNutrition status of refugees in camps Across the 19 camps, 23 600 children were acutely malnourished, 3 300 severely so. The wasting prevalence was 'very high' among refugees in 4 out of 19 camps, and 'high' in 4 others. The severe wasting prevalence was over 2 percent in five camps. All camps with high wasting were in north-eastern Chad. Stunting levels were 'very high' (over 30 percent) in 18 camps. Barely any children had adequate dietary diversity (5-6.9 percent). In eight camps child anaemia levels were 'very high'. The percentage of breastfed children (52.2 percent) has been falling in recent years (SENS 2017 and 2019).\n\nSource: Chad IPC Technical Working Group, December 2019.

However, when considering the areas analysed in both years, there was a 1.3 million increase. The major deterioration in acute food insecurity was in South Kivu province where an additional 711 000 people were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above), a rise from 13 percent to 26 percent of the population. While the number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) decreased in Kasai and Tanganyika provinces, the proportion remained extremely high at around 40 percent.\n\nAcute food insecurity among refugees The country hosts a refugee population of 524 100, largely from Rwanda, the Central African Republic, South Sudan and Burundi: 26 percent live in 11 camps or sites and 74 percent in host communities (UNHCR, January 2020). Although all Burundian, South Sudanese and Central African refugees receive food assistance, a large percentage face poor or borderline food consumption and employ coping strategies to meet basic needs. While refugee households with poor food\n\nBACKGROUND Although the December 2018 elections marked the country's first peaceful transfer of power and armed conflict diminished in some areas in 2019, it intensified in others. Decades of conflict, displacement and lack of civilian protection coupled with very high levels of poverty, weak political and economic governance and persistent structural deficiencies aggravate humanitarian needs (OCHA, December 2019). The country hosts Africa's largest IDP population at over 5 million (UNHCR, January 2020).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW In the latter half of 2019 an estimated 15.6 million people were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above), representing 26 percent of the analysed rural population.1 Of these, 3.9 million were in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). The situation was worst in 15 areas classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) in Ituri, South Kivu, the Kasais and Tanganyika provinces. Another 52 territories were classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Some 27 million people were in Stressed (IPC Phase 2).\n\nFEWS NET's analysis of available evidence suggests the population requiring emergency food assistance in 2019 was lower than the IPC estimate.

She has lost her main source of income as a result and struggles to provide for her 10 children. consumption decreased from 37 percent to 31 percent from 2018 to 2019 for Central Africans in Bosobolo, in Libenge the share with poor food consumption increased from 1.6 percent to 7 percent (WFP 2019).\n\nConflict/insecurity ACLED data shows that political violence - around half of it against civilians - rose at even higher rates in 2019 than in 2018, especially in the eastern provinces of North Kivu, South Kivu and Ituri (ACLED, December 2019). The conflict has taken on many forms in these areas including inter-ethnic and intercommunal conflicts, and clashes between multiple armed groups that have attacked and obliterated villages, destroying fields and harvests and stealing herds, thus reducing household food sources and incomes (FEWS NET, December 2019).\n\nBetween October 2018 and September 2019, 1.1 million were forced to abandon their homes and livelihoods often during critical periods for transhumance and crop preparation (OCHA, 2020). Around 34 percent of the newly displaced IDPs were from North Kivu, 31 percent from South Kivu and 22 percent from Ituri (UNHCR, 2019).\n\nIn the Kasais and Tanganyika, the scale of violence decreased, but the provinces still hosted a large number of IDPs. The Kasais also hosted a large number of returnees from Angola.\n\nThe number of cases of Ebola, which broke out in North Kivu and Ituri in August 2018, increased dramatically from March 2019 as the response was severely hindered by armed groups. The outbreak disrupted agricultural activities and limited access to livelihoods (FEWS NET, April 2019).\n\nWeather extremes and crop pests Adequate, well-distributed precipitation during most of the year benefitted crops, except in the Bas and Haut-Uélé and western provinces. However, localized heavy rains, particularly in the agro-pastoral mountains of South Kivu, resulted in flooding and crop damage. Significant crop losses were also reported due to fall armyworm infestations, particularly in maize-growing regions (FAO-GIEWS, September 2019). Other pests reduced agricultural production in the Grand Katanga, Grand Kasai, the Ex-Oriental and Western provinces. In Maniema, mealybug ravaged more than 3 500 hectares of cereals. Around 4 800 households were affected by the pest as well as by various small ruminant epizootic diseases (FEWS NET, July 2019). In December floods and landslides in the north-eastern, central-eastern and western provinces damaged the crop cycle (FEWS NET, December 2019).\n\nThe 2019 main season food crop production was forecast below the previous five years, limiting market supplies and Source: Democratic Republic of the Congo IPC Technical Working Group, June 2018.

This was exacerbated in south-eastern areas by the dire shortage of maize in the main supplying countries, including Zambia and Zimbabwe, and by weak local currency (FEWS NET December 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW In 2019, an estimated 3.4 million children were wasted, 1.1 million of them severely so, requiring urgent treatment for acute malnutrition (HNO, December 2019). The GAM prevalence was 'medium' at 6.5 percent, reaching 'high' levels in Nord Ubangi, Ituri, Kwilu, Tshuapa and Haut Uélé. The national prevalence of stunting was 'very high' at 41.8 percent and exceeded 50 percent in Kwango, Kasai Central and Sankuru (MICS, 2017-18).\n\nChild feeding practices were extremely poor. Overall just 8 percent of 6-23 month-olds consumed the minimum acceptable diet required for their growth and development (MICS, 2017-18).\n\nAnaemia levels were of 'severe' public health significance for both children under 5 and women of reproductive age (WHO, 2016). More than two thirds of households did not have access to an improved source of water within a 30-minute round trip from home (UNICEF and WHO, 2017).\n\nDisplaced people were often denied access to health care, safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. Immunization schedules for children were interrupted by violence, while attacks on health providers and centres prevented people from receiving treatment (WHO, April 2019).\n\nThe country is grappling with the outbreak of many diseases. Besides the world's second biggest ever Ebola outbreak in North Kivu, South Kivu and Ituri provinces, it had one of the world's most severe measles epidemics with a total of 311 471 suspected cases in 2019 (WHO, January 2020).

Chronic malnutrition and anaemia are serious public health problems in all camps, ranging from 45-66 percent.

This includes 63 000 in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and 239 000 in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) (IPC, November 2018).\n\nThe number of acutely food-insecure people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) increased by over 88 000 between 2018 and 2019 in the areas analysed, but the increase could be even higher as several areas in the northern and western parts of the country, which suffered a reduction in agricultural production, were not assessed in 2019 (IPC, 2019).\n\nThe situation was projected to be most critical in Usulután, which was estimated to have the highest proportion (35 percent) and number of acutely food-insecure people (134 000) facing Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) conditions, even before taking into account the effects of shocks in 2019 (IPC, November 2018).\n\nSubsistence farmers and minimum wage labourers were the most vulnerable to food insecurity, especially households headed by women, as in recent years high levels of outmigration have left many women single-handedly heading farms and families (WFP et al., 2017).\n\nBACKGROUND El Salvador is densely populated and suffers from persistent low levels of economic growth. However, it has experienced a moderate reduction in poverty (the poverty rate declined from 39 percent in 2007 to 29 percent in 2017) and inequality and improvements in public services in recent years (WB, October 2019). Its challenges include insufficient food production and high dependence on imports (WFP, November 2019). It is frequently exposed to natural hazards including earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Its territory is entirely within the Dry Corridor, which is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including higher frequency of floods, droughts and tropical storms (WB, October 2019). Recurrent droughts hamper progress in poverty and food insecurity alleviation. Around 33 percent of households live in multidimensional poverty and on average allocate 65 percent of expenditures to food (WFP, August 2019).\n\nFor the last five years smallholder farmer Cirilo Mendoza's crops have been severely damaged by recurrent drought and he has been unable to find a job to support his wife and young child. He borrowed money to migrate to the US but was detained and deported home.\n\nWeather extremes Rainfall amounts during planting of the main season were more than 50 percent above the long-term average. However, this was followed by drought in June-July, which particularly affected production in eastern parts (FAO-GIEWS, October 2019). Between June and August five dry periods affected the main season in eastern El Salvador (MARN, August 2019)\n\nThese irregular rains and above-average temperatures in July and August particularly affected agricultural production during the main season in San Salvador, La Unión, San Miguel and Santa Ana. This marks the second consecutive year of poor primera season harvests and particularly high losses for subsistence farmers across the Dry Corridor, after the severe drought of 2018 (GEOGLAM, October 2019).\n\nHowever, the aggregate main maize crop in 2019 was anticipated to be around average at 835 000 tonnes (FAO-GIEWS, October 2019).\n\nHeavy rains in September affected Morazán, La Union, Santa Ana, Chalatenango and Cabañas departments, causing interruption of access to potable water for 450 households (OCHA, October 2019), and delayed planting operations for the second season in the large producer departments of San Miguel and La Unión (FAO-GIEWS, October 2019). The rains damaged crops and the Government estimated that 18 300 tonnes out of a forecast 250 000 tonnes of postrera season beans would be lost, with most losses in the central and western parts, particularly in Ahuachapán, La Libertad, Cuscatlán and Santa Ana departments (El Economista, October 2019).\n\nSome coffee losses were also expected, while flooding in pasture areas caused animal disease (El Diario de Hoy, October 2019). In addition, the local producer association (CAMPO) estimated 5 percent of the postrera season maize crop would be lost (El Economista, November 2019).\n\nEconomic shocks In the last decade the country suffered a great decline in coffee production, once the most important source of revenues from exports. The sector had not recovered from the leaf rust damages of 2011-2013 and continued to decline due to low international prices, lack of investment and also from the erratic weather and dry conditions that affected flowering and bean development.\n\nIn the last six years jobs in the sector halved to 44 600, prompting migration to urban areas or abroad, with 30 percent of farmers abandoning their farms (USDA GAIN, May 2019). However, the sector still represents an important source of work. The 2019 decline in international coffee Source: El Salvador IPC Technical Working Group, November 2018.

The homicide rate in 2018, estimated at 50.3 per 100 000 people, was the third highest in the world after Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) and Jamaica (IGARAPE Institute, 2018).\n\nWidespread violence forced thousands to flee their homes. In 2018, around 46 800 Salvadorans sought asylum worldwide, with the country ranking as the sixth country of origin for new asylum seekers globally. In addition, at least 71 500 Salvadorans have been internally displaced by violence (UNHCR, July 2019), accumulating a total of 246 000 people by 2018 (IDCM, 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) prevalence among children under 5 in El Salvador was classified as 'very low' in 2014. GAM was considered 'medium' in Usulután (7.4 percent) and Santa Ana (7 percent) departments. At 13.6 percent the stunting level was classified as 'medium' (MICS, 2014).\n\nInfant and young child-feeding practices need improvement, as fewer than half (46.7 percent) of infants under 6 months of age were exclusively breastfed and 67 percent of children aged 6-23 months consumed a minimum acceptable diet (MICS, 2014). Anaemia was also found to be a 'moderate' public health concern among children and women (WHO, 2016).\n\nAround 13 percent of children suffered from diarrhoea two weeks prior to MICS data collection (MICS, 2014). By 2017, access to basic drinking water services was good (97 percent of the households) (JMP, 2017).\n\nIn 2019, El Salvador was experiencing a dengue outbreak with a 220 percent increase in the number of reported cases compared to 2018. By the end of July almost 8 900 cases were reported with nine possible deaths linked to the disease (OCHA, July 2019).\n\nM A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9 | E S W A T I N I\n\nESW ATINI IPC TECHNICAL W ORKING GROUP JULY 2019 232 000 IPC Phase 3 or above in October 2019-March 2020\n\n370 000 IPC Phase 2 Stressed\n\nIPC Phase 3 Crisis IPC Phase 4 Emergency 185 000 47 000\n\n76% Rural 24% Urban Total population of country 1.4M\n\nEswatini\n\nThe number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) remained unchanged, reflecting a second consecutive year of localised shortfalls in food production and constrained food availability.\n\nAcute food insecurity is forecast to persist at current levels in early 2020.

Out of this total, 47 000 people were classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and 185 000 people were in Crisis (IPC Phase 3).\n\nThe majority of the population analysed were in IPC Phase 1 (Minimal) and Phase 2 (Stressed), with an estimated 370 000 in Stressed (IPC Phase 2). At the sub-national level, the highest rates of acute food insecurity were assessed to reach 25-35 percent of the population in Hhohho, Shiselweni and Lubombo regions (IPC, July 2019).\n\nCompared to the previous year's peak (December 2018-March 2019) (IPC, December 2019), the number of people in need of urgent humanitarian food assistance remained largely unchanged with a negligible improvement of 6 percent, as a second consecutive year of localized shortfalls in cereal production maintained high humanitarian needs.\n\nFood security conditions improved seasonally in mid-2019 straight after the 2019 harvest. From June-September 2019 around 205 000 people (22 percent of the rural population) were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above).\n\nBACKGROUND Eswatini's economy is closely tied to South Africa. Agriculture is the primary livelihood for the predominantly rural population (WB, 2019). However, amid low agricultural productivity, the country remains structurally deficit in key food staples (KoE, December 2018). A high rate of poverty, estimated at 59 percent in 2017, limits improvements in agricultural productivity and food security, with slow economic growth, high inequality, high HIV/AIDS prevalence and weather shocks being key factors inhibiting significant improvements in the population's welfare (WB, 2019).\n\nEswatini is still recovering from the 2015/16 El Niño-induced drought, which dried up water sources and caused widespread crop failure and hunger. In 2019, rainfall deficits again caused shortfalls in food crop production.\n\nNevertheless, crop failures and a consequent decrease in labour opportunities, combined with higher food prices, caused a worsening of acute food insecurity towards the end of the year (IPC, July 2019).\n\nWeather extremes Eswatini is still recovering from the 2015/16 El Niñoinduced drought, which cost the country over SZL 3.8 billion (USD 264 million). As most of the food crop production is rain-fed and irrigation infrastructure remains unaffordable to smallholder farmers (KoE, December 2018), the rainfall deficits during a critical crop development phase in the 2018/19 cropping season caused localized shortfalls in food crop production in 2019, which underpinned the poor food security situation (FAO-GIEWS, October 2019).\n\nOver one in four people reported having experienced a weather-related shock, such as drought, irregular rains or dry spells in 2019, rising to almost half of the population in Lubombo region (EVAC, July 2019).\n\nThe aggregate national cereal harvest in 2019 declined by about 16 percent compared to the previous year, with most crop failures concentrated in the eastern Lubombo and southern Shiselweni regions because of erratic rainfall. Cereal import requirements increased to 200 000 tonnes which is slightly above the average (FAO-GIEWS, October 2019). Comparing households' harvests in 2019 with the previous year, about 46 percent reported to have harvested half of the previous season and around 9 percent had no harvest or experienced total crop failure (EVAC, July 2019).\n\nAlthough the 2019 cereal harvest fostered a cyclical improvement in food security from June-September, reflecting a boost in food stocks and a seasonal increase in income-generating opportunities, these improvements were short-lived.\n\nBy October, the 25 percent of the rural population classified as in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) had depleted their food stocks earlier than normal and were engaged in crisis or emergency coping strategies, such as the sale of productive assets, to meet their essential food needs (IPC, July 2019).\n\nEconomic shocks In mid-2019, casual labour opportunities were limited and by June unemployment in Lubombo region had increased to 29 percent and was expected to increase even further at the end of the year (IPC, July 2019). Nationally, unemployment was estimated at 28 percent (EHES, 2018). Over 80 percent of households in most areas experienced a loss of income. Only around 10 percent fully recovered from the shocks they experienced, which included loss of assets (EVAC, July 2019).\n\nSource: Eswatini IPC Technical Working Group, July 2019. The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.\n\nEswatini, IPC Acute food insecurity situation, October 2019-March 2020\n\nAlmost 40 percent of households had depleted their food stocks within three months of harvest, and were reliant on markets for food, resorting to coping strategies when they were unable to afford to buy the food they needed (EVAC, July 2019). The National Maize Corporation (NMC) kept prices of the main staple maize meal stable until mid-June when the retail price increased (FAO-GIEWS, October 2019).\n\nBy October 2019, the national average maize meal price was 11 percent higher than its year-earlier level. Much of the price growth during 2019 was due to rising prices in South Africa, the country's main supplier of grains (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019). However, market regulations, administered by the NMC, lessened the effects of imported inflation and contributed to more stable domestic retail prices of maize meal (FAO-GIEWS, October 2019).\n\nThe situation in 2019 is aggravated by structural challenges and widespread poverty, with higher rates in rural areas, accentuated the impacts of weather shocks on food security in 2019 (WB, 2019).\n\nLow incomes constrain access to farming inputs, while poor access to markets and agricultural-related information further impede improvements in agricultural productivity. The lack of competitive labour skills also limits households' ability to find alternative employment when weather shocks minimize agricultural work opportunities (WB, 2011).\n\nOut of the top six main livelihood activities, which cover some 83 percent of the population, only three could be considered sustainable: formal labour (18 percent), small business (14 percent) and remittances (17 percent), while food crop production (12 percent) and casual labour (11 percent), particularly in the agriculture sector, are highly susceptible to weather anomalies. Social grants represent the primary income for 11 percent of the population, indicating either unemployment or lack of working-age people in those families (EVAC, July 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW Acute malnutrition among children under 5 years of age remained 'very low' (1.5 percent) but the stunting prevalence was 'high' at 26.3 percent - with boys more affected than girls by almost 10 percentage points. Some regions experienced both undernutrition and overweight. For example, Hhohho region had the highest rates of stunting at 28.6 percent, but above national-average levels of overweight at 16.4 percent. Stunting levels were higher in areas categorized in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) levels of acute food insecurity (EVAC, July 2019).\n\nReproductive aged women (15-49 years) had low levels of underweight (3 percent) based on body mass index while 27 percent were overweight and another 29 percent obese (EVAC, July 2019).\n\nJust over half (51 percent) of children aged 6-23 months received a minimum acceptable diet with Manzini and Lubombo regions recording below-national levels. Around 59 percent of children received recommended dietary diversity (EVAC, July 2019). Consumption of fruits and vegetables remained below global recommendations. Besides household food insecurity, limited knowledge paired with misconceptions about child feeding challenge adequate nutrition for children (KoE, December 2018).\n\nEswatini has one of the highest HIV prevalence rates in the world. In 2018, 27.3 percent of the adult population were living with HIV, representing 210 000 people. Well over half of them (63 percent) were women (UNAIDS, 2018).\n\nNationally, a third of households do not have access to at least basic drinking water services, dropping to 21.8 percent in Manzini. On average, it takes up to 30 minutes for people to collect the water during the dry season (UNICEF and WHO, 2017).\n\nM A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9 | E T H I O P I A 56.9% of children under 5 years and 24.3% of women 15-49 years are anaemic.\n\n41% of households have access to at least basic drinking water services.\n\n13.8% of children 6-23 months meet the minimum dietary diversity requirement.\n\n58.6% of children under 6 months are exclusively breastfed.\n\n4.5M children under 5 years are acutely malnourished, of whom 0.6M are affected by SAM.\n\n36.8% of children under 5 years are stunted.\n\n1.6M Ethiopians were internally displaced.\n\nThere were around 735 200 refugees from South Sudan (45%), Somalia (26%), Eritrea (21%), and the Sudan (7%).\n\nThere were 1.1M Ethiopian returnees.\n\n12.0-60.3% of children under 5 years and 3.3-44.7% of women 15-49 years in 24 camps are anaemic.\n\n97.5-100% have access to improved drinking water sources.\n\n79% Rural Population analysed 28.7M (26% of total population, including displaced populations) ETHIOPIA IPC TECHNICAL W ORKING GROUP SEPTEM\n\nBER 2019\n\n8M IPC Phase 3 or above in July-September 2019\n\n10M IPC Phase 2 Stressed IPC Phase 3 Crisis IPC Phase 4 Emergency 6.1M 1.9M\n\n21% Urban Total population of country 112.1M\n\nThe number of food-insecure people in need of urgent assistance was almost as high as in 2018, despite difference in population coverage of analyses.\n\nNumbers forecast to increase from February-June 2020 (to 8.5 million).

At the start of Meher harvests in October 2019, food security improved, but about 6.7 million people remained in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) (IPC, November 2019).\n\nEthiopia is the second largest host of refugees in Africa (UNHCR, December 2019). The result of the annual SENS report indicated that monthly food assistance for refugees lasted from 14-25 days, creating food gaps for up to 17 days a month. Dietary diversity was often poor mainly due to lack of access to fresh fruits and vegetables (UNHCR/WFP, 2016).\n\nWeather extremes and crop pests The February-May Belg rainy season was characterized by late onset, erratic distribution and below-average rains. A below-average secondary Belg season harvest in eastern Amhara, eastern Oromiya and north-eastern SNNP regions was expected. In East and West Harerghe zones, where no significant rains were received until April and seasonal cumulative precipitations were up to 60 percent below average, the cereal output was very poor, with crop failures\n\nBACKGROUND While Ethiopia has made development gains over the last two decades (WFP, January 2020), 27 percent of the population, or 30.2 million people, were still living below the poverty line (USD 1.90 a day). Over 70 percent of rural Ethiopians are severely poor according to the Multidimensional Poverty Index (OPHI, September 2019). Frequent and severe droughts have eroded resilience for rural households that have lost productive assets and have had little time for recovery between drought events (WFP, January 2020).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW About 8 million people were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) across Afar, Amahara, Oromiya, Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' region (SNNPR), Somali and Tigray from July-September 2019, despite receiving humanitarian food assistance.1 This includes about 1.9 million in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) of whom over 1 million were in Oromiya. Around a third of the populations in Somali and Oromiya faced Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above). An additional 10 million people were classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) (IPC, November 2019).\n\nFEWS NET's analysis of available evidence suggests the population requiring emergency food assistance in 2019 was lower than the IPC estimate. For more information, see https://fews.net/ east-africa/ethiopia 1\n\nFollowing years of drought and poor rainy seasons in the Somali region pastoralists faced another extended dry and hotter-than-average period in 2019. reported in some areas (FEWS NET June 2019, FAO-GIEWS, December 2019). In western key-producing areas, the June-September Kiremt rains were up to 30 percent above average and aggregate cereal production is estimated at above-average levels. However, unseasonal heavy rains during the October/November harvest resulted in localized crop production shortfalls (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019). Crops were attacked by desert locusts at the end of the year in northern and south-eastern Tigray, north-eastern Amhara and Eastern Oromiya regions. While coordinated control measures implemented by farmers, local communities and the Government have contained crop losses, substantial localized losses were reported in parts of Oromiya zone (FEWS NET December 2019, FAO-GIEWS).\n\nHouseholds in pastoral and agroastoral areas of southern SNNP, southern and eastern Oromiya and southern Somali regions, faced an extended dry and hotter-than-average period through April 2019. The Gu/Genna (March-May) rains were delayed, erratically distributed and below normal, resulting in poor regeneration of pasture and water resources and poor livestock body conditions and little to no milk production (FEWS NET, June 2019). Subsequently, abundant October- December 2019 Deyr-Hageya rains regenerated rangeland resources and improved vegetation conditions, livestock body conditions and conception rates. However, pastoralists' recovery was curbed by widespread floods that killed livestock and increased waterborne animal diseases, as well as by locust infestations damaging pasture (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019).\n\nConflict/insecurity Continued intercommunal violence as well as clashes between Government forces and unidentified armed groups (UAG) in rural areas persisted, driving internal displacement, disrupting livelihood activities and distorting food market systems and prices (OCHA, 2020). While violent events occurred in all regions, most were in western and southern Oromia. Violence in Gambella affected local communities and refugees, while ethnic tensions in Amhara and areas bordering Benishangul Gumuz and Tigray displaced thousands. Many communities continued to be affected by unresolved historical tensions and grievances over resources, mainly land and water, as well as political, administrative and social rights (OCHA, 2020).\n\nOf the 1.6 million IDPs, about two thirds were displaced by intercommunal violence. At the peak of the displacement crisis from January-April 2019, conflict and climate shocks brought the number of IDPs to 3.2 million (OCHA, 2020). IDPs in collective sites experience deplorable conditions and limited access to basic services (OCHA, January 2020).\n\nEconomic shocks Prices of maize increased by 30-65 percent from January- October in several markets, including the capital, Addis Ababa, as seasonal upward trends were amplified by reduced supplies from the secondary Belg harvest, and by depreciation of the local currency that increased the prices of fuel and agricultural Source: Ethiopia IPC Technical Working Group, November 2019.

Prices of other cereals, including teff, wheat and white sorghum were up to 40 percent above their year-earlier levels in Addis Ababa by October (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019). Although prices of livestock increased through 2019 in the southern Somali region due to lower supplies, staple food prices increased at faster rates. The deterioration of terms of trade created severe food access constraints for pastoralist households, at a time when they were trying to repopulate their herds and had few animals to sell (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019).\n\nHigh youth unemployment (64 percent of the population is under 25) was identified by the Government as a key contributor to political fragility and increased migration (internationally and rural to urban) (OCHA, January 2020). As a result of sluggish export performance and a foreign exchange crunch purchases of food for humanitarian relief were constrained (OCHA, January 2020).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW Nationally acute malnutrition rates are classified as 'medium' at 7.2 percent (Ministry of Finance and UNICEF, October 2019). Almost 1 million children have severe acute malnutrition annually (EmDHS, 2019). Malnutrition rates are highest in rural, hard-to-reach areas where people face difficulties and/or discriminations in accessing health and nutrition services and among pastoralist populations (OCHA, January 2020).\n\nAlthough stunting decreased significantly among children under 5 from 58 percent in 2000 to 36.8 percent in 2019, it is still classified as 'very high' (DHS, 2000-2019). In Afar, Amhara and Tigray regions stunting levels exceeded 40 percent, and only 7.3 percent of children received a minimum acceptable diet (OCHA, January 2020).\n\nFood insecurity along with water shortages, poor sanitation facilities and lack of access to quality healthcare contributed to deteriorating child nutrition. Nationally sanitation coverage was only 57 percent - in other words more than 45 million people lack access to improved sanitation (IFRC, July 2019). As of 8 December 2019 and since the beginning of the outbreak in April 2019, 2 089 cases of cholera had been reported (ECDC, December 2019). There were 9 672 cases of measles in Amhara, Afar, Oromiya and Somali and five cases of vaccinederived polio reported in 2019 (WHO, December 2019).\n\nNutrition status of refugees Refugee nutrition was concerning in the 21 camps assessed by the 2019 SENS: 33 percent of camps had GAM rates above the 'very high' threshold, while 48 percent had 'high' levels. In over 60 percent of camps child anaemia levels were of 'high' public health significance. Nursing mothers may stop breastfeeding due to psychological distress and insufficient access to food and water. Unsolicited donations of breast milk substitutes and milk products risked adequate young child feeding (IYCF) practices (OCHA, January 2020).\n\nEthiopia, IPC Acute food insecurity situation, October 2019-January 2020\n\nM A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9 | G U A T E M A L A Population analysed 16.6M (95% of total population)\n\n3.1M IPC Phase 3 or above in March-June 2019\n\nGUATEM ALA IPC TECHNICAL W ORKING GROUP M ARCH 2019\n\n4.8M IPC Phase 2 Stressed IPC Phase 3 Crisis IPC Phase 4 Emergency 2.5M 568 000\n\n49% Rural Total population of country 17.6M\n\nGuatemala\n\nIntense climate shocks, crop losses and high prices increased the number of people Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above).\n\nPersisting lack of grain reserves following the 2019 drought and depressed household incomes, particularly for coffee growers, will increase acute food insecurity.\n\nDHS 2014-15\n\nW HO 2016 DHS 2014-15 DHS 2014-15 51% Urban\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY AND MALNUTRITION DRIVERS\n\n4Insecurity, lack of economic opportunities, evictions and food insecurity drive internal displacement and migration.\n\n4Erratic rainfall and a prolonged dry period during the main season affected most of the country, causing major crop losses.\n\n4Subsistence households were particularly badly affected and had very low grain stocks.\n\n4Minimum wage workers and agricultural labourers had insufficient income to cover their basic needs and maize and beans prices were higher than normal.\n\n4Households were yet to recover their livelihoods and assets following the 2018 drought.\n\nNUTRITION INDICATORS 36.5% of children under 5 years and 16.4% of women 15-49 years are anaemic.\n\n94% of households have access to at least basic drinking water services.\n\n62.6% of children 6-23 months meet the minimum dietary diversity requirement.\n\n53.2% of children under 6 months are exclusively breastfed.\n\n0.7% of children under 5 years are acutely malnourished, of whom 0.1% are affected by SAM.\n\n46.5% of children under 5 years are stunted.\n\nG U A T E M A L A | M A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9\n\n© W FP/CARLOS ALONZO\n\nGUATEMALA The situation was most critical for the rural population yet to recover from the 2018 drought in the six departments facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) conditions, namely Alta Verapaz, Baja Verapaz, Quiché, Santa Rosa, Jalapa and Chiquimula (IPC, March 2019) and extended later in the year also to Suchitepéquez and Retalhuleu (IPC, December 2019).\n\nThe lean season was expected to extend until August 2019. Due to high agricultural losses in the Primera season, subsistence farmers were particularly affected (IPC, March 2019). By September, some areas in Huehuetenango, Retalhuleu, Totonicapán and Jutiapa were estimated to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) by the IPC-compatible analysis (FEWS NET, September 2019). Towards the end of 2019, food security improved in rural areas thanks to the Postrera harvest and related labour opportunities (IPC, December 2019).\n\nWeather extremes The year 2019 marked the second consecutive year of poor Primera season harvests and particularly high losses for subsistence farmers after the severe drought of 2018 (GEOGLAM, October 2019). In contrast to the previous year when drought affected mostly subsistence production\n\nBACKGROUND Guatemala has one of largest economies in Central America, but around 6 in 10 Guatemalans live in multidimensional poverty, meaning they face deprivation in multiple aspects of their lives, including food security, nutrition, decent employment, health, housing and education (MPPN, November 2019).\n\nIt is also one of the most socially unequal societies with indigenous peoples particularly disadvantaged (ACAPS, November 2019). Social inequality is aggravated by the country's high vulnerability to climate change. Over the past three years, extended dry seasons have had a severe impact on the livelihoods of subsistence farmers, who rely on rain-fed agriculture, especially in the Dry Corridor (WFP, accessed January 2020).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW Around 3.1 million people - 18 percent of the analysed population - were estimated to be in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) during March-June 2019. This included 568 000 in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and 2.5 million in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). An additional 4.8 million were classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) (IPC, March 2019).\n\nAround 6 in 10 Guatemalans live in multidimensional poverty, facing deprivation in food security, nutrition, decent employment, health, housing and education. regions, the lower precipitation in the 2019 main season had negative impacts at the national level. The most affected northern departments of Alta Verapaz, Petén and Quiché, which contribute about 40 percent of the main season output, received rainfall that was 20-30 percent below average (FAO-GIEWS, November 2019).\n\nBy September, El Progreso, Jutiapa, Zacapa, Chiquimula, Baja Verapaz and Quiché departments of the Dry Corridor were affected by irregular rains, late onset of rains and high temperatures, which resulted in 50 percent losses of the Primera harvest (FEWS NET, August 2019). In central and eastern parts, subsistence farmers' yields were 75 percent below average, while some larger producers in Quiché and Retalhuleu departments reported around 40 percent reductions (GEOGLAM, October 2019).\n\nImprovement in rainfall from mid-September was promising for the Postrera maize and bean harvests, which account for 20 percent of the annual production (FAO-GIEWS, November 2019) but June-August irregular rainfall and excess humidity in October resulted in low yields in Güija and Chortí microregions (IPC, December 2019). Thus, below-average overall aggregate maize production was anticipated for 2019 (FAO-GIEWS, November 2019).\n\nHeavy rains in September caused flooding and landslides, and led to localized crop damages in Chiquimula, Escuintla, Jutiapa, Quetzaltenango and Retalhuleu departments (FEWS NET, October 2019). By November, almost 1.3 million people nationwide had been affected by the rains with reported injuries, evacuations and damages to infrastructure (CONRED, November 2019).\n\nIn the first half of 2019, around 12 000 people were newly displaced by disasters. Between May and November excessive rains were responsible for over 5 000 displacements with many of them in need of shelter and food assistance (IDMC, January 2020).\n\nEconomic shocks The poorest families in the Dry Corridor areas faced low incomes during April-May (FEWS NET, April 2019), and the situation remained the same towards the end of the year for subsistence farming families who had lost their Primera harvest. Their dependency on markets increased, they had to adopt consumption-based coping strategies and to consider atypical migration patterns (FEWS NET, October 2019; IPC, December 2019). In March, the minimum wage covered about 80 percent of a basic food basket while staple food prices remained more or less stable (FEWS NET, April 2019). Maize prices peaked during June-July before dropping to earlier levels by October, reflecting the seasonal pattern. The price of black beans however increased slightly from August (FAO-GIEWS, November 2019).\n\nThe coffee harvest represents a main source of labour for over 500 000 people dependent on work as small producers and/or cutters in the coffee industry in 204 out of 340\n\nSource: Guatemala IPC Technical Working Group, March 2019.

Coffee input costs increased and negatively affected production (FEWS NET, August 2019) lowering incomes for coffee-dependent families (FEWS NET, October 2019).\n\nInsecurity From January-May 2019, an average of 13 murders per day were recorded and gang-related violence is high. Overall, violence creates significant protection issues, especially for women, and poses a major constraint for humanitarian access (REDLAC, April 2019). The levels of violence, deficits of basic services and poverty continued to cause large groups to migrate to the United States or Mexico, although new border security measures and increasingly hostile immigration and asylum-seeking legislation and policies were of high concern for all Central American migrants (ACAPS, December 2019).\n\nInsecurity and eviction of indigenous communities associated with large-scale business activities also drove internal displacement (IACHR, July 2018).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW While acute malnutrition prevalence was very low (below 5 percent during March-June 2019 (IPC, March 2019), stunting was very high with 46.5 percent of children under 5 years short for their age. District-level differences in stunting levels were wide, reaching 70 percent in some departments (DHS, 2014-15).\n\nThe Ministry of Health reported an increase in acute malnutrition from March-August of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 (MoH, 2020). Coverage of health services is poor and unequal, and is one of the biggest challenges in the country (PAHO WHO, 2020). Since July the country experienced an outbreak of dengue, which was worsened by the floods and heavy rains during the same period. Almost 40 600 cases were reported at national level from January- October 2019 (PAHO WHO, 2019). In addition, an increase in diarrhoeal diseases likely due to drinking untreated water also affected the population (IPC, December 2019).\n\nGeneral immediate causes of malnutrition include inadequate diets (52 percent of children aged 6-23 months consumed a minimum acceptable diet in 2014-15 (DHS, 2014-15)) and morbidity, while underlying causes include limited ability to acquire sufficient quantities and quality of food, limited purchasing power, poor access to services, limited householdlevel food production and knowledge gaps regarding nutrition (WFP, October 2017).\n\nM A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9 | H A I T I 34 500 Haitians were internally displaced, slightly down from 38 000 in March 2018.\n\n302 100 of Haitians internally displaced by the 2010 earthquake have returned.\n\nPopulation analysed 10.5M (93% of total population, not including displaced populations)\n\n3.7M IPC Phase 3 or above in October 2019-February 2020\n\nHAITI IPC TECHNICAL W ORKING GROUP OCTOBER 2019\n\n3.2M IPC Phase 2 Stressed IPC Phase 3 Crisis IPC Phase 4 Emergency 2.6M 1.1M\n\n45% Rural 55% Urban Total population of country 11.3M\n\nHaiti\n\nPoor economic and security conditions compounded by climate shocks and the longterm impact of natural disasters worsened acute food insecurity.\n\nAcute food insecurity forecast to increase as the worsening economy and civil unrest are likely to deepen acute food insecurity during the lean season.\n\nIOM JAN 2019\n\nDHS 2016-17\n\nDHS 2016-17 DHS 2016-17 HNO 2020\n\nEconomic shocks Weather extremes Conflict/insecurity\n\n4Currency depreciation and high inflation as well as reduced cereal production and low market availability increased staple prices.\n\n4Work opportunities became scarcer for poor households both in rural and urban areas.\n\n4Aggregate cereal output was expected to be 12 percent below year-earlier levels.\n\n4Violent political demonstrations severely disrupted markets and livelihoods in urban areas.\n\n4Civil strife disrupted humanitarian access and basic services.\n\n4Although chronic malnutrition is more of a public health concern than acute at the national level, a sizeable number of under-5s needed treatment for acute malnutrition in drought-affected areas.

Around 25 percent of the population lives under the international poverty line (WB, December 2019). In February, violent anti-government protests and roadblocks gravely affected economic activities and public services (OCHA, June 2019). From March, Haiti had no government and civil unrest re-emerged in September (UNSC, October 2019).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW Around 3.7 million people - 35 percent of the population analysed - were Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) and in need of urgent assistance in the last quarter of 2019, including over 1 million in Emergency (IPC Phase 4).1 Some 3.2 million people were in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) during that period (IPC, October 2019). This marked an increase of almost 600 000 in rural areas since the same period a\n\nFEWS NET's analysis suggests the population requiring emergency food assistance in 2019 was lower than the IPC estimate.

The low areas of Nord-Ouest remained in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and the very poor districts of Cité Soleil were classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). Four rural areas (in Artibonite, Nippes and Grande Anse) had 45-50 percent of their population in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above). Four urban areas had up to 40 percent in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) (IPC, October 2019).\n\nThe situation was already precarious at the beginning of the year when around 2.26 million people were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above). It deteriorated to 2.63 million people during the lean season in March-June 2019 (IPC, December 2018).\n\nEconomic shocks The Haitian Gourde depreciated by 35 percent against the US dollar between October 2018 and 2019 (FAO, December 2019), which triggered high inflation (23 percent year-on-year in October). Direct foreign investments, which fell by 78 percent in 2018, continued falling following the February civil strife (FEWS NET, June 2019). The lack of government compounded the situation with financing from international organizations blocked (FEWS NET, September 2019). Between 2018 and\n\n2019, the national growth rate was reportedly the lowest since 2010, the year of the earthquake, prompting a rise in urban unemployment (IPC, October 2019).\n\nIn October, rice prices - mostly sourced from the international market - were at record or near-record highs despite sustained imports in the third quarter of 2019. Prices of local maize meal were on average about 50 percent higher than their yearearlier levels, and in the capital Port-au-Prince, they almost doubled compared to the October 2018 levels (FAO, December 2019).\n\nIn rural areas the most vulnerable households lacked agricultural work opportunities - because of high labour costs and limited resources of farmers (FEWS NET, April 2019) - and faced high food prices. They resorted to negative coping strategies and alternative sources of income such as migration, petty trade or selling charcoal (FEWS NET, March 2019).\n\nWeather extremes The El Niño phenomenon, which resulted in rainfall deficits and dryness in 2018, continued until mid-2019, affecting the main agricultural season for the second season running, particularly in the main producing areas in Ouest, Sud and Sud-Est (FAO, July 2019).\n\nCombined with high production costs resulting from currency depreciation and high inflation, the 2019/2020 prospects for Source: Haiti IPC Technical Working Group, December 2018.

From August-November, rainfall deficits and localized floods affected autumn harvest prospects (FEWS NET, October 2019).\n\nConflict/insecurity Social unrest intensified from August 2018. In February, the growing demand for political reforms and better living conditions led to almost two weeks of demonstrations, which turned violent in some areas, blocked economic activities, and resulted in major market and livelihood disruptions in urban areas, such as Port-au-Prince, Cap Haïtien, Gonaïves and Les Cayes (FEWS NET, February 2019).\n\nIn September, Haitians again took to the streets to protest against the lack of government and lack of fuel (FEWS NET, September 2019). Barricades, insecurity and high fuel prices hindered movement of people and goods, which reduced market supplies and increased food prices (IPC, October 2019).\n\nRural traders could not access markets, sell their products or buy supplies, while the poorest households faced limited income-earning opportunities because of restrictions on urban migration and petty trade (FEWS NET, October 2019).\n\nSome humanitarian organizations had to suspend operations due to security concerns and lack of fuel (ACAPS, October 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW In 2019 an estimated 65 500 children under 5 years in drought-affected areas were acutely malnourished and in need of nutrition interventions (OCHA, 2019). Nationally, the GAM rate of children under 5 years was 'low' at 3.7 percent but the stunting rate was 'high' at 21.9 percent (Ministère de la santé publique et de la population, July 2018).\n\nJust 1 child in 10 consumed the minimum acceptable diet needed for growth and development, and 1 in 4 had minimum acceptable dietary diversity (MSPP, July 2018).\n\nAnaemia affected 66.3 percent of children aged 6-59 months, indicating a moderate concern, while almost half (49.0 percent) of women of reproductive age were anaemic, classified as high (MSPP, July 2018).\n\nAccess to drinking water was a concern for malnutrition with just 65 percent of households having at least basic drinking water (WHO and UNICEF 2017).\n\nBetween 2010 and 9 November 2019 Haiti had around 820 450 suspected cholera cases - though the number fell from 3 777 in 2018 to 674 in 2019 (ECDC, November 2019).\n\nHigh healthcare costs were the main reason for 58 percent of families with sick or injured members not seeking medical care (MSPP, July 2018).

Among those, 176 800 were in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). Around 1.8 million were in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) (IPC, December 2019).\n\nThis represents an increase from 519 000 (18 percent of population analysed) in 2018 in part due to wider coverage and spread of drought (Honduras TWG, 2019; and Honduras TWG, 2018).\n\nIn eight comparable areas the increase was from 509 500 in 2018, to 566 900 in 2019. In spite of better coverage, the numbers of acutely food-insecure people are likely higher than estimated as data gaps persist in areas with limited access (Gracias a Dios) and in areas where data was not collected (Atlántida, Cortés and urban Francisco Morazán) (IPC, December 2019).\n\nOf the 13 departments analysed, the situation was most severe in the seven areas classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), namely El Paraíso, Francisco Morazán (except Central District), Intibucá, La Paz, Copán, Choluteca and Valle. The greatest number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above)\n\nBACKGROUND During recent years Honduras has registered the second highest economic growth rates in Central America, only behind Panama (WB, October 2019). Despite an improvement in economic output and decrease in public debt in recent years, high levels of poverty exist and inequality is among the highest in the region and the world. While the poverty rate fell from around 61 percent to 53 percent between 2005 and 2017, the extreme poverty rate was over 17 percent, the highest rate in Latin American countries after Haiti (WB, October 2019). It is vastly exposed to natural adverse events and climate change, especially heavy and irregular rainfall and long periods of drought in the southern and western regions of the country, known as the Dry Corridor, leading to major crop losses that disproportionately affect the poor (WB, October 2019).\n\nIn the face of high levels of poverty and inequality as well as increasing climate shocks, inequitable access to land, insufficient food production and high unemployment, subsistence farming families work hard to diversify their sources of income.\n\n25 percent lower than the 29-year average in several maize-producing departments (FAO-GIEWS, October 2019). The low, sporadic rainfall resulted in 70-100 percent losses of the August-September Primera (main) maize harvest in eastern and southern parts. In the areas where subsistence agriculture is dominant losses were above 85 percent.\n\nNationally, the losses were estimated at around 50 percent for maize, 25 percent for beans and 27 percent for rice with the greatest losses concentrated in the main-producing municipalities of Olancho and El Paraíso as well as in Valle, the northern part of Choluteca, the south-western part of Francisco Morazán and the southern part of La Paz (FEWS NET, October 2019).\n\nRainfall amounts increased from mid-September, reducing soil moisture deficits and easing planting operations, so the minor season maize harvest in December was likely to be above- average. However, the aggregate maize crop in 2019 was anticipated to be below-average at 470 000 tonnes since the main season harvest accounts for about 80 percent of annual production. A large number of livestock also died due to forage and water deficits in Olancho department (FAO-GIEWS, October 2019)\n\nThis marks the second consecutive year of poor Primera season harvests and particularly high losses for subsistence farmers across the Dry Corridor, after the severe drought of 2018 (Crop Monitor, October 2019).\n\nSource: Honduras IPC Technical Working Group, December 2019. The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.\n\nHonduras, IPC Acute food insecurity situation, November 2019-February 2020 was in Choluteca with about 117 000, El Paraíso (99 000) and Olancho (97 000).\n\nAll areas analysed included between 2-6 percent of the population in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) (IPC, December 2019). The households most at risk of acute food insecurity were wage labourers and subsistence farmers, especially those in highly marginalized communities with difficult road and market access and those headed by women.\n\nA comparative analysis for the Copán region which was also analysed earlier in the year showed an improvement in late 2019 compared to the March-June 2019 period, when around 288 000 people were classified in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above), compared to 240 000 in November 2019-February 2020 (IPC, February 2019, IPC, December 2019).\n\nWeather extremes In August, the government declared a national state of emergency over drought, and the particular need to provide support to communities in approximately 100 municipalities in the central, eastern and southern parts of the country (FEWS NET, October 2019).\n\nRainfall amounts during June-August were more than\n\nHigh temperatures and dry conditions also induced forest fires and pest outbreaks, further affecting crop production. During October, heavy rainfall triggered flooding and landslides in western Honduras, affecting 700 people, destroying 100 houses and damaging several roads (ECHO, October 2019).\n\nPoor soil conditions, over exploitation of forest resources, degraded lands, small plots and lack of access to credit, agricultural supplies and technical assistance drive agricultural productivity and profitability further down (WFP, January 2020).\n\nEconomic shocks Vulnerable subsistence farming families, who lost their primera harvest crops, needed a regular income to buy their food supplies in markets, but employment opportunities were scarce and income not sufficient, so they were likely to resort to coping strategies, such as money or grain borrowing and migration to urban areas (FEWS NET, October 2019).\n\nFor instance, many poor households depend on work as small producers and/or cutters in the coffee industry. But the 2019 decline in international coffee prices hit coffee growers in western Honduras hard and depressed the demand for wage labourers (IPC, December 2019).\n\nDomestic prices of white maize increased from the beginning of 2019 to September when they started to decline with the commercialization of supplies from the main season harvests. Prices of red beans were on the rise since May 2019, following seasonal trends. In September 2019, they were higher than a year earlier, reflecting reduced minor season outputs (FAO-GIEWS, October 2019).\n\nInsecurity Criminal actors generate widespread human rights violations (threats and intimidation, homicides, extortion, trafficking, kidnappings, child recruitment and sexual and gender-based violence). Recent human rights reports show that the current fear and insecurity among the civilian population can be compared with that experienced in armed conflicts (NRC, June 2019).\n\nDespite a downward trend in recent years, the country's murder rate continues to be among the highest in the world (HRW, January 2020). Civil riots and protests lead to confrontations between military forces and civilians (UN, June 2019).\n\nGang-related violence, poverty and lack of education opportunities are causing thousands of children and families to flee their homes. Without access to protection and safe migration pathways, most are forced onto dangerous routes where they are at risk from violence, exploitation and abuse (UNICEF, April 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW Data on child nutrition in Honduras was quite outdated. According to the latest available figures, it had 'high' levels of chronic malnutrition, which affected 22.6 percent of children under 5 years of age (DHS, 2011-12). The rate for acute malnutrition in 2011-12 was 'very low.' The rate for exclusive breastfeeding of infants was low at 31.2 percent (DHS, 2011- 12). The most recent anaemia (WHO, 2016) rates - with 31.4 percent of children aged 6-59 months anaemic, indicating a moderate public health problem - suggests that children's diets may not contain adequate micronutrients.\n\nPeople in Honduras had generally good access to an improved water source (93 percent). However, the difference between rural and urban areas was still wide at 14 percentage points, as almost all (99 percent) urban populations had access to improved water compared to 86 percent of rural people (JMP, 2017). Around 88 percent of people had access to improved sanitation and 7 percent practised open defecation, rising to 14 percent of the rural population (JMP, 2017).\n\nIn 2019, a dengue epidemic and diarrhoeal diseases - likely due to untreated water consumption and water scarcity in some areas - reached alarming levels. By October 2019, there were 86 705 cases of dengue, 20 percent of which were potentially lethal. There were also 197 cases of Chikungunya and 217 cases of Zika (GoH, October 2019).\n\nM A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9 | I R A Q Over 1.4M Iraqis were internally displaced.\n\nThere were 245 800 Syrian refugees, up from 233 000 in July 2019.\n\nThere have been almost 4.5M Iraqi IDP returnees since 2015.\n\nPopulation analysed 39.3M (100% of total population)\n\n1.8M food-insecure people in need of urgent assistance Jan-Dec 2019\n\nData not available for marginally food-insecure people\n\nOCHA NOVEM BER 2019\n\n30% Rural 70% Urban Total population of country 39.3M\n\nIraq\n\nThe numbers in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, including for food and livelihoods, fell, but many groups remained vulnerable, facing protracted displacement and political volatility.\n\nConditions for refugees remain highly precarious amid severe livelihood losses, refugee camp closures, and limited access to humanitarian assistance.\n\nUNHCR DEC 2019 IOM NOV 2019 IOM NOV 2019\n\nW HO 2016 M ICS 2018\n\n4The security situation remained fragile, hampering displaced people's safe returns.\n\n4Some 78% of nearly 1.5 million IDPs have been displaced for more than three years, competing for scarce work with host communities.\n\n4Although return rates have slowed, around a million returnees grapple with resilience and recovery needs and face a lack of livelihoods.\n\n4From October, protests against corruption, unemployment and poor services became violent and further complicated the humanitarian response.\n\n4Seasonal floods in March caused displacement and affected access to safe water.\n\n4Child malnutrition rates seem not to be a concern, but exclusive breastfeeding rates are low and only one in three children receives a minimum acceptable diet.\n\n24.1% of children under 5 years and 29.1% of women 15-49 years are anaemic.\n\n93.1% of households have access to at least basic drinking water services.\n\n44.6% of children 6-23 months meet the minimum dietary diversity requirement.\n\n25.8% of children under 6 months are exclusively breastfed.\n\n2.5% of children under 5 years are acutely malnourished, of whom 0.8% are affected by SAM.\n\n9.9% of children under 5 years are stunted.\n\n13.9% of children under 5 years in Duhok, 13.8% in Erbil, and 13.8% in Sulaymaniyah are stunted. 2% of children under 5 years in Duhok, 3.1% in Erbil and 1.2% in Sulaymaniyah are acutely malnourished.\n\nI R A Q | M A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9\n\n© UNHCR/RASHEED HUSSEIN RASHEED\n\nIRAQ include IDPs in camps and in out-of-camp locations; recent returnees to areas where humanitarian needs are already high; female- and child-headed households, women and girls; people with perceived affiliations to extremists; victims of physical, mental and psychological violence and people living with disabilities (OCHA, November 2019).\n\nIDPs' food consumption deteriorated in the first four months of 2019: by April, 25 percent had inadequate food consumption, up from 8 percent in December 2018. Expenditure share on food purchases increased by 7 percentage points during the same time period (WFP, April 2019). By November, over 30 percent of Syrian refugees in Iraq were adopting crisis-level livelihood coping strategies, up from below 10 percent in April (WFP, November 2019).\n\nConflict/insecurity The security situation in Iraq remained unpredictable in 2019. The lack of civil and security control in disputed areas continued to enable non-state actors, including ISIL, to mount small-scale attacks almost weekly in certain governorates. Antigovernment demonstrations against corruption, lack of basic services and high unemployment started in Baghdad and Shiite areas in October and later spread to other governorates\n\nBACKGROUND December 2019 marked two years since Iraq's military operations against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) ended. During ISIL's 2014-2017 occupation millions were displaced, infrastructure and livelihoods were destroyed, social cohesion eroded and basic services disrupted. The country still faces social, ethnic and sectarian tensions as well as political uncertainty and violence. Iraq is an anomaly of an upper middle-income country at 'very high risk' of a humanitarian crisis requiring international assistance (OCHA, November 2019).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW Out of the 4.1 million people in Iraq in need of humanitarian assistance, about 1.77 million are in acute need of support, including food and livelihoods assistance. More than 816 000 of them are children. Half of those in urgent need are concentrated in only two governorates - Ninewa and Al-Anbar - which host high numbers of returnees. Diyala, Salah Al-Din and Kirkuk governorates also have high numbers of people in acute need of assistance (OCHA, November 2019).\n\nThose directly affected by the 2014-2017 conflict are the most vulnerable. Several population groups find it particularly hard to meet their basic needs or access essential services. These\n\nFive years after fleeing her home, Matra Nsayef is trying to rebuild her life in the small agricultural village of Yathreb - once known as the fruit basket of Iraq.\n\n(ACLED, October 2019). By November, violence around the protests had escalated and the prime minister had resigned and by December, around 400 people had died (ACLED, December 2019).\n\nThe protests and uncertain security affected humanitarian operations. Intermittent curfews were imposed in Baghdad and the southern governorates, resulting in missions being delayed or cancelled. In Ninewa UN agencies and NGOs were unable to carry out relief activities in camps because of delays in getting approvals and access letters (OCHA, November 2019).\n\nBy October, there were still over 1.4 million IDPs across 18 governorates (IOM, November 2019). Out of 1.2 million people displaced outside of camps, more than two-thirds had not returned to their areas of origin for over three years (OCHA, November 2019). The remaining IDPs in camps include people who are not welcome to return due to unproven affiliations to extremist groups - they often face challenges in accessing assistance (ACAPS, October 2019).\n\nHowever, some 4.4 million IDPs have returned since 2015 across eight governorates, usually to experience severe hardship (IOM, November 2019). Considerable secondary displacement has resulted from forced and premature returns and forced or coerced departures from camps and informal settlements in Ninewa, Salah Al-Din, Al-Anbar, Kirkuk and Diyala governorates (OCHA, November 2019).\n\nIn August, the Government of Iraq consolidated and closed several IDP camps with the aim of all displaced people returning home by the end of 2020. Between August and October, on average 222 households left camps every day, many moving to non-camp settings, but 3 300 families transferred to other camps (IOM, October 2019). Many IDPs in out-of-camp locations are cut off from assistance (HNO, November 2019).\n\nIn October 2019, a military offensive by Turkey against Kurdish forces in north-east Syria compounded existing insecurity and uncertainty on Iraq's western border (OCHA, November 2019). Around 19 000 Syrians crossed the border to Iraq between mid-October and December 2019 (IOM, January 2020).\n\nInsecurity and displacement continued to constrain farmers' access to agricultural lands, while agricultural inputs and machinery remained expensive and in short supply (FAO-GIEWS, April 2019), worsening medium-term food security prospects. Even though the agricultural sector is small, it still plays a role in Iraq's economy (FAO, January 2020).\n\nEconomic shocks Iraq's economy is slowly recovering, with GDP expected to grow 5 percent in 2019 mainly due to higher oil prices and better security (WB, October 2019). But progress on reconstruction and development is slow and much of the infrastructure damaged or destroyed (OCHA, November 2019).\n\nSource: FSIN, based on data extracted from IOM, December 2019.

The unemployment rate has increased beyond the 2012 level to 9.9 percent in 2017/18, but was nearly 21 percent for women. Underutilization is particularly high among IDPs, with almost 24 percent unemployed or underemployed (WB, April 2019).\n\nThe poor performance of the agricultural sector and lack of rural employment have driven migration to urban areas where people face poor public service delivery and increasing poverty (FAO, January 2020).\n\nEven though physical market access for IDPs and returnees was good, they were often unable to buy essential goods because their monthly income was lower than the basic needs threshold (MCNA, December 2019). Based on WFP price data, cereal prices remained stable during 2019 except for rice, which peaked in March before dropping. Bread prices peaked in August (WFP, December 2019).\n\nWeather extremes Heavy rains during March/April caused flooding in several governorates with Salah al-Din, Bara and Missan the worst affected. Floods caused temporary displacement and disrupted clean water supplies in some areas (OCHA, May 2019), affecting an estimated 273 000 people in central and southern governorates overall (USAID, June 2019). However, the 2019 cereal harvest was favourable - estimated at 5.6 million tonnes, over 80 percent above the 2018 harvest and 30 percent above the five-year-average (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW The 2018 MICS found 'low' prevalence (2.5 percent) of acute malnutrition among children aged 6-59 months. The highest prevalence of 5 percent was found in Najaf and Qadissiyah governorates. Like wasting, stunting was 'low' at 10 percent with the highest levels found in Kirkuk (15 percent) and Thiqar (14.5 percent) (MICS, 2018). Among pregnant and lactating women, only 3 percent were considered as acutely malnourished (CFSVA, 2016).\n\nA very low percentage (25.8 percent) of children under 6 months were exclusively breastfed. Just 34.3 percent of 6-23 month-olds consumed the minimum acceptable diet required for their growth and development (MICS, 2018).\n\nNationally 93 percent of households had access to at least basic water services, falling to 87 percent in rural areas (MICS, 2018). Access to safe water, however, has been fragile in Basra governorate, which experienced a water crisis in 2018 (HRW, July 2019). Health facilities suffered huge damage during the 2014-2017 conflict with half destroyed in 13 of the 16 assessed cities in Iraq (Word Bank, January 2018). From 1 January through 17 November 2019, Iraq had 1 222 confirmed cases of measles (WHO, November 2019).\n\nIraq, IDP returnees by governorate of return, December 2019\n\n780-50 000\n\n100 001-500 000\n\n> 1 500 000\n\n50 001-100 000\n\n500 001-1 500 000\n\nTotal IDP returnees by governorate\n\nM A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9 | K E N Y A\n\nThere were nearly 490 000 refugees and asylum seekers from Somalia (54%), South Sudan (24%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Burundi and the Sudan.\n\nKenya\n\nThe acute food insecurity situation deteriorated mainly as a result of very late and erratic long rains as well as flash floods and landslides.\n\nConditions are expected to improve due to short rains boosting livestock conditions and productivity, although desert locust swarms are expected to expand further into the north-eastern areas of the country.\n\nW HO 2016 DHS 2014 DHS 2014\n\nPopulation analysed 13.9M (26% of total population, including IDPs, returnees and refugees)\n\n3.1M IPC Phase 3 or above in August-October 2019\n\nKENYA IPC TECHNICAL W ORKING GROUP JULY 2019\n\n6M IPC Phase 2 Stressed IPC Phase 3 Crisis IPC Phase 4 Emergency 2.7M 357 000\n\n73% Rural 27% Urban Total population of country 52.6M\n\nSENS 2018 SENS 2018\n\nSENS 2018 UNHCR DEC 2019 ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY AND MALNUTRITION DRIVERS DISPLACEMENT Weather extremes Economic shocks Conflict/insecurity 4Late onset of rains, dry spells and erratic rainfall caused cereal production shortfalls.\n\n4Pastoral and marginal agricultural areas faced high prevalence of human/animal diseases.\n\n4Flash floods and landslides disrupted livelihoods, displaced thousands, destroyed farmlands and crops, and swept away livestock and irrigation systems, mainly in north-eastern, central and coastal regions.\n\n4Insecurity, resource-based conflict and cattle rustling limited access to markets and resulted in loss of livestock.\n\n4High food prices limited purchasing power of low-income households.\n\n4The drought-related food crisis has lowered milk consumption and increased WASH-related illnesses, contributing to higher child malnutrition rates.\n\n41.1% of children under 5 years and 27.2% of women 15-49 years are anaemic.\n\n59% of households have access to at least basic drinking water services.\n\n40.9% of children 6-23 months meet the minimum dietary diversity requirement.\n\n61.4% of children under 6 months are exclusively breastfed.\n\n4% of children under 5 years are acutely malnourished, of whom 0.9% are affected by SAM.\n\n26% of children under 5 years are stunted.\n\n46.7-60.7% of children under 5 years and 27.5-53% of women 15-49 years in 5 camps are anaemic.\n\n99.7-100% of households in 5 camps have access to improved drinking water sources.\n\n10.5% of households in Kakuma camp and 10.7% in Dagahaley camp do not consume micronutrient rich food.\n\n62.5-91.2% of children under 6 months in 5 camps are exclusively breastfed.\n\n14 600 children under 5 years are acutely malnourished, of whom 2 400 are affected by SAM.\n\n18-27.3% of children under 5 years in 5 camps are stunted.\n\nK E N Y A | M A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9\n\n© FAO/LUIS TATO\n\nKENYA The number of acutely food-insecure people in need of emergency food assistance increased throughout 2019 from an estimated 1.1 million in February to 1.6 million in May and 2.6 million by July (GoK, 2018 and 2019).\n\nIn July 2019, most of those in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) were pastoralist households in Turkana, Mandera, Baringo Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit and Tana River or marginal agricultural and agro-pastoral households in Kitui, Makueni, Kilifiand Meru North. From August-October these were still the main areas of concern, but with additional acutely food-insecure populations in Isiolo, Tharaka and Samburu (IPC, October 2019).\n\nAcute food insecurity among refugees Refugees in Dadaab and Kakuma camps and Kalobeyei settlement have not been able to diversify their incomes enough to meet their basic needs because of restrictions on animal ownership, movement and formal employment. Refugees in the camps have faced ration cuts of 15-30 percent. The results of SENS 2018 indicated that their monthly food assistance lasted from 14-19 days. Between 44 percent and 84 percent of refugees in the camps used one or more negative coping strategies.\n\nBACKGROUND Though down from 47 percent in 2005/06, more than one in three (36 percent) Kenyans were still living on under the international poverty line1 in 2015/16 (WB, October 2018). The most severe conditions exist in the arid and semi-arid droughtprone north, which accounts for 80 percent of the country's land-mass and is often affected by local conflicts. Rapid population growth, climate change, stagnating agricultural production, gender inequalities and underperforming food systems pose significant challenges to food and nutrition security (WFP, August 2019).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW Almost 3.1 million people, representing 22 percent of the population analysed in arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs), were facing Crisis conditions or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) from August-October 2019. This included over 2.7 million in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and 357 000 in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) (IPC, October 2019). Some 43 percent of the population analysed had minimal adequate food consumption and were classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) (IPC, October 2019).\n\nUSD 1.90 per day in 2011 PPP 1\n\nYoung Pokot pastoralists milk a cow in the early morning. Years of inter ethnic strife, including armed cattle raids, and the effects of a rapidly changing climate have strained the tradition of resource and knowledge sharing between cross-border tribal groups in West Pokot and Turkana in Kenya and Karamoja in Uganda.\n\nWeather extremes The March-April 'long rains' were generally very poor. In south-eastern and coastal marginal agriculture livelihood zones maize production was an estimated 50-60 percent below average, with near failure of the harvest reported in several south-eastern areas (FAO-GIEWS, September 2019). However, in the Rift Valley and Western provinces improved rains from May resulted in average maize production (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019). Drought conditions in March and April in northern pastoral areas and prevailing moisture deficits resulted in poor livestock conditions and limited milk production, atypical migration patterns and competition over natural resources (FAO-GIEWS, June 2019).\n\nExceptionally abundant October-December 'short-rains' benefitted yields and induced farmers to increase areas planted, resulting in an estimated above-average cereal production (FAO-GIEWS, March 2020). These rains regenerated pasture and rangelands and improved livestock body conditions, allowing many to recover from the 2018/2019 drought (FEWS NET, 2019).\n\nHowever, these rains also caused devastating flash floods and landslides disrupted livelihoods, destroyed crops and swept away livestock, irrigation systems, roads, houses, health clinics and sanitation services, mainly in north-eastern, central and coastal regions. Up to 160 000 people in 31 counties were affected and 18 000 displaced (OCHA, November 2019).\n\nConflict/insecurity Deteriorated forage and water resources during the first half of 2019 led to atypical livestock migration resulting in increased resource-based conflicts over grazing rights and access to water resources in Meru North, Kitui, Samburu, Turkana, West Pokot, Marsabit, Tana River, Garissa, Isiolo and Nyeri counties. This subsided with the October-December rains when livestock returned to their traditional grazing lands (FEWS NET, August 2019). Periodic cattle rustling led to increased tensions, loss of livestock and limited access to markets. Sporadic terrorist attacks against civilians and state security forces by Al Shabaab affected trade and commodity movements in counties bordering Somalia (RoK, 2019).\n\nEconomic shocks Maize prices, mostly stable at low levels in the first quarter of 2019, surged by 60-85 percent from March-June in markets located in main urban centres and in western key growing areas, as seasonal patterns were compounded by concerns over the impact of the severe dry conditions on 'long rains' crops. Subsequently, prices declined by about 30 percent from August-December, as local harvests increased supplies. However, prices in December remained 40-70 percent Source: Kenya IPC Technical Working Group, October 2019. The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.\n\nKenya, IPC Acute food insecurity situation, August-October 2019 higher than 12 months earlier (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019), supported by crop production shortfalls, lower imports from Uganda and disruptions to transport infrastructure. A poor harvest due to heavy rainfall contributed to sustain the high level of prices, although the Government's stock release prevented further spikes (FAO-GIEWS, February 2020).\n\nLivestock prices increased in late 2019 as animal body conditions improved, and in most pastoral key reference markets ranged from average to 42 percent above average in December. These increases outpaced those of cereal prices, and the goat-to-maize terms of trade were 6-23 percent above average in December, thus supporting gains in household purchasing power (FEWS NET, December 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW The nutrition situation deteriorated in several counties from February-July 2019. Laisamis, Turkana South and North were classified in Extremely Critical (IPC Phase 5). North Horr, Turkana Central and West, Mandera, Wajir, Garissa and Tiaty in Baringo county were in Critical (IPC Phase 4); Isiolo and West Pokot were in Serious (IPC Phase 3) (IPC, July 2019). See map 31. In ASAL counties over 541 300 children (6-59 months) required treatment for GAM in 2019, including 113 941 for SAM (UNICEF, March 2019).\n\nPoor food availability (including of milk) and increasing food prices are among the drivers of this high prevalence of acute malnutrition. Limited access to health and nutrition services following a scale-down of integrated outreaches in some areas, such as Laisamis in Marsabit, are also contributory factors. High morbidity, poor child-feeding practices, poverty, high illiteracy and poor infrastructure aggravate the problem (IPC, July 2019).\n\nIn 2014, the national prevalence of stunting was 26 percent, ranging from 'medium' in Nairobi and Central region to 'very high' in Coast and Eastern regions (DHS 2014).\n\nBy the end of the year 5 150 cholera cases had been reported with the outbreak still active in Garissa, Wajir, Turkana and Kirinyaga counties (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, accessed 27 January 2019). In the first half of the year, 418 measles cases were reported across Wajir, Tana River, Kilifiand Kwale counties. In September, 425 suspected cases were reported in Kajiado county and in December, a new outbreak was reported in Pokot North (WHO, January 2020).\n\nNutrition status of refugees in camps The prevalence of GAM was 12.7 percent in Kakuma, 9.3 percent in Kalobeyei and 8 percent in Dadaab camps in December 2018. The prevalence of stunting averaged 22.6 percent in Kakuma and Dadaab, where a high prevalence of anaemia (>40 percent among 6-59 month-olds and nonpregnant women aged 15-49 years) was concerning. Nearly 11 percent of households were not consuming micronutrient-rich foods in Kakuma and Dagahaley (SENS, 2018).\n\nKenya, IPC Acute malnutrition situation, August-October 2019\n\nM A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9 | L E S O T H O 2.1% of children under 5 years are acutely malnourished, of whom 0.8% are affected by SAM.\n\n34.5% of children under 5 years are stunted.\n\nPopulation analysed 1.5M (63% of total population)\n\n433 000 IPC Phase 3 or above in October 2019-March 2020\n\nLESOTHO IPC TECHNICAL W ORKING GROUP JUNE 2019\n\n553 000 IPC Phase 2 Stressed\n\nIPC Phase 3 Crisis IPC Phase 4 Emergency 362 000 71 000\n\n72% Rural 28% Urban Total population of country 2.3M\n\nLesotho\n\nAnother year of reduced harvests increased households' market reliance, while income-earning opportunities fell and prices soared, increasing levels of acute food insecurity.\n\nContinuing dry-weather conditions could result in a poor 2020 harvest, worsening acute food insecurity.\n\nW HO 2016 M ICS 2018 M ICS 2018\n\n4Chronic malnutrition among under 5s is a greater concern than acute malnutrition and is mainly driven by children having diets that are severely lacking in nutritional diversity.\n\n4Rainfall deficits caused a decrease in staple food production for the second consecutive year.\n\n4The poor harvests reduced households' food supplies and income-generating opportunities in a country reliant on agricultural labour.\n\n4Higher prices of staple cereal products diminished households' capacity to access food.\n\n4Labour opportunities during the harvest were limited by the poor crop performance and construction and domestic work opportunities also decreased.\n\nNUTRITION INDICATORS 50.4% of children under 5 years and 27.4% of women 15-49 years are anaemic.\n\n79.4% of households have access to at least basic drinking water services.\n\n18.6% of children 6-23 months meet the minimum dietary diversity requirement.\n\n59% of children under 6 months are exclusively breastfed.\n\nL E S O T H O | M A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9\n\n© W FP/TSITSI M ATOPE\n\nLESOTHO BACKGROUND Half of the population lives in poverty, rising to 61 percent or 801 000 people in rural areas. Some 31 percent of rural Basotho live in extreme poverty.1 Unemployment is estimated at 28 percent overall and 43 percent among youths aged 15-24. About 71 percent of the population is involved in some form of agricultural work, mainly low productivity subsistence agriculture and/or low-paying agricultural jobs. Smallholders have limited use of irrigation, improved seed, fertilizers and pesticides, contributing to low yields and widespread rural poverty. Climate change and environmental shocks are major challenges, especially frequent droughts and heavy seasonal floods (WB, December 2019).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW An estimated 433 000 people - representing 30 percent of the population analysed - were assessed to be in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) in the October 2019-March 2020 period, with all areas of the country classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Out of this total number, an estimated 362 000 people were classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and 71 000 in\n\nThe extreme poverty line is based on a food basket required to achieve the minimum daily calorie requirement of 2 700 kilocalories (kcal) per adult equivalent per day. 1\n\nUnpredictable weather conditions have reduced productivity in a country where more than 70 percent of the population works in agriculture. Makhomo, a 68-year-old widow from Boleka village, has experienced the impact of drought firsthand.\n\nEmergency (IPC Phase 4) meaning they needed urgent action to save lives and livelihoods. Approximately 553 000 people faced Stressed (IPC Phase 2) conditions and were in need of longer-term resilience-building and livelihood protection measures (IPC, July 2019).\n\nCompared to the previous year's acute food insecurity peak in December 2018, when 274 000 people needed urgent humanitarian food assistance, the number of people facing Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) conditions increased by 58 percent (IPC, November 2018).\n\nWeather extremes Lesotho experienced extreme rainfall deficits between October 2018 and January 2019 (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at the beginning of February was about 60-90 percent below normal (FEWS NET, February 2019).\n\nThe area planted for maize for 2018/19 dropped nationwide and was significantly lower than the past four years (LVAC, July 2019). Maize production, which accounts for the bulk of the national cereal output, was estimated at about 35 000 tonnes, over 60 percent below the previous five-year average (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019). Compared with the previous year, 2018/19 maize production decreased by 73 percent, wheat by 61 percent and sorghum by 93 percent (LVAC, July 2019).\n\nAlthough the overall availability of maize, the key food staple, remained stable as domestic supplies were buttressed by imports from South Africa, the harvest shortfalls led to food gaps for many rural households (LVAC, July 2019).\n\nAt the district level, there was a significant decrease in cereal production in southern Qacha's Nek district (LVAC, July 2019), due to extreme rainfall deficits at the start of the cropping season. As a result of the steep production decline, almost 10 percent of the district's population was classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) (IPC, July 2019).\n\nOverall, 39 percent of households own livestock, rising to 60 percent in Mokhotlong, 59 percent in Thaba-Tseka and 51 percent in Mohale's Hoek. Livestock deaths increased, attributed to lack of water and pasture as well as diseases. Households sold stock to buy food, pay for education and medical expenses (LVAC, July 2019).\n\nEconomic shocks After two consecutive years of reduced crop production, households' minimal food stocks made them more reliant on market supplies to meet their consumption needs. However, lower income levels and higher food prices adversely affected their capacity to buy food (IPC, July 2019). In 2019, 23 percent Source: Lesotho IPC Technical Working Group, July 2019.

Agricultural employment improved towards the end of 2019 but remained below typical levels (FEWS NET, December 2019).\n\nSales of livestock products decreased by 70 percent, crop sales by over 64 percent and weeding by 53 percent. On average, 5.2 percent (102 families) reported to have at least one member of the household who had migrated to South Africa, rising to 35 percent in Leribe and 14 percent in Berea (LVAC, July 2019). According to the WB, remittances are decreasing as employment in South Africa, particularly in the mining sector, has recently declined (WB, December 2019).\n\nFood prices were 7 percent higher year-on-year in November 2019 and, specifically, the price of bread and cereals, the country's primary staple foods, were up by 11 percent (BOS, November 2019). The increase in cereal prices mostly reflected high prices in South Africa, the country's main supplier of grains, while the reduced domestic harvest exerted additional upward pressure on food prices (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW The rates for acute malnutrition were 'very low' with 2 percent of children aged 6-59 months wasted, less than 1 percent severely so (MICS, 2018). This marked an improvement from 2017 when 5 percent were wasted (LVAC 2017). Prevalence of wasting among boys (2.4 percent) was slightly higher than among girls (1.7 percent) (MICS, 2018). Chronic malnutrition remained 'very high' with 34.5 percent of children under 5 years stunted, rising to around 45 percent in the foothills and mountains ecological zones (MICS, 2018).\n\nOnly 10.4 percent of children aged 6-23 months consumed a minimum acceptable diet required for their growth and development, though the proportion rose to 19 percent among children in urban areas versus 6 percent in rural areas. Just 59 percent of infants were exclusively breastfed until 6 months (MICS, 2018).\n\nClose to 90 percent of households used improved drinking water sources but with 9 percent of them taking more than 30 minutes for water collection. Therefore, the percentage of those with access to at least basic drinking water services fell to 79 percent, ranging from 71 percent in rural areas to 94 percent in urban areas. Seventy-three percent used improved sanitation facilities while 19 percent defecated in the open, increasing to 28 percent in rural areas (MICS, 2018).\n\nBy the end of the year the measles outbreak in Lesotho was ongoing in Qacha's Nek district. As of 15 November, a total of 59 suspected cases had been reported, with no reported associated deaths (WHO Bulletin, December 2019).\n\nLesotho had 340 000 people living with HIV.

Southern areas have experienced repeated drought, notably in 2015/2016 and 2017/2018 (WFP, May 2019). In January 2019, President Andry Rajoelina was inaugurated after peaceful elections in December 2018, therefore ending a decade-long period of political instability (UN, 2019).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW At least 1.3 million people were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) during the lean season between November 2018 and March 2019 in southern and eastern districts, which included around 366 400 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). Most of these acutely food-insecure people were in the arid Grand Sud area.1 In addition over 1.3 million people were\n\nThe 'Grand Sud' encompasses the following districts: Ambovombe, Bekily, Beloha, Tsihombe (Androy), Taolagnaro, Amboasary (Anosy), Ampanihy, Betioky, Morombe and Toliara II (Atsimo Andrefana). 1\n\nTravelling to market by Zebu cart: the lean season started early as rainfall deficits had a negative impact on rice and maize crops in late 2018 in southwestern, eastern and extreme southern parts-by January households had already depleted their food stocks and were market reliant. classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) during this period (IPC, October 2018).\n\nAmpanihy and Beloha districts were classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), while Ambovombe and Tsihombe were in Crisis (IPC Phase 3!) only thanks to the provision of humanitarian assistance. Amboasary, Betioky and Bekily faced Crisis (IPC Phase 3) conditions and all the other districts analysed faced Stressed (IPC Phase 2) (IPC, October 2018).\n\nWith the beginning of the main harvest period, the food security situation improved from June when around 730 500 were classified in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) including 135 000 in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) in three districts of the Grand Sud. Food security further improved by July-October when no populations were classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and around 500 000 were in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) (IPC, November 2019).2 The number in need of urgent assistance started to increase again during the lean season from November, reaching 728 000 in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above). (IPC, November 2019).3\n\nHumanitarian assistance was provided in Bekily, Beloha and to a lesser extent in Tsihombe between July and October. 3 October 2018 and November 2019 data are not comparable due to a different coverage of analysis. However, in the comparable areas, the number of acute food insecure in October 2019 - March 2020 was lower than during the 2018 lean season. 2\n\nWeather extremes Rainfall deficits had a negative impact on rice and maize crops in late 2018 in south-western, eastern and extreme southern parts (FAO-GIEWS, January 2019). Western areas faced a decrease in local rice production because of well below-average rains, while in southern areas maize production was near zero following unevenly distributed rainfall, pest outbreaks and high costs of seeds (FEWS NET, April 2019).\n\nCyclones Desmond and Ekestang in early 2019 flooded maize and rice fields in south-western and middle-western areas (FEWS NET, January 2019), and cyclone Gelena brought aboveaverage rainfalls in northern areas (FEWS NET, February 2019). Overall, the 2019 cereal production increased compared to the previous year and to the five-year average, with significant increases in rice production, which was 18 percent above 2018 levels and cassava production, which was 12 percent above.\n\nHowever, significant production shortfalls were reported locally, such as in the Grand Sud where the region of Androy has experienced a significant drop in rice production over the past six years. In these areas, despite favourable rainfall compared to the previous year, agricultural production remained constrained by the lack of inputs resulting from previous failed agricultural campaigns (MAEP, FAO and WFP, Source: Madagascar IPC Technical Working Group, October 2018. The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.\n\nMadagascar, IPC Acute food insecurity situation, November 2018-March 2019\n\nArea would likely be at least one Phase worse without the effects of humanitarian assistance 2019). Localized dry spells and cyclones also affected the start of the 2019/2020 season. In late October, around 80 percent of the Grand Sud faced 'moderate' or 'severe drought' (UNICEF, November 2019). On 9 December, tropical cyclone Belna made landfall on the western coast and displaced 2 300 people (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nCrop pests Fall armyworm infestations also contributed to the 2018/2019 maize production being 30 percent below the five-year average, including significant shortfalls in the southern and south-western areas (FEWS NET, October 2019). According to FAO estimates, the outbreak infested half of maize crops (FAO, December 2019), which discouraged farmers from planting (FAO-GIEWS, November 2019). Locust infestations affected rice and pulse crops in southern and central-southern areas (FEWS NET, July 2019), although to a lesser extent than in the previous decade.\n\nEconomic shocks By January, households were highly dependent on markets during the lean season because of the low 2018 cereal output and early depletion of food stocks (FEWS NET, March 2019), particularly in the southern and south-eastern areas. Heavy rains following the cyclones affected supply routes to southern markets (FEWS NET, January 2019) where around four in five communes faced shortages of cassava. Rice prices were\n\n14 percent above their year-earlier levels, maize prices were 39 percent higher, and cassava 50 percent higher. Daily wages were low and decreasing due to a limited demand for labour. Four in five vulnerable households in the south, and two in three in the south-east had to reduce their number of daily meals as a coping strategy until April-May (SISAV, February and April 2019).\n\nIn the post-harvest period in July-August, rice prices were still 10 percent above their year-earlier levels in Grand Sud (SISAV, August 2019). The lean season started earlier than usual - in October instead of December - because of reduced production in these areas and early depletion of households' stocks (FEWS NET, September 2019).\n\nMore generally, a structural issue continued to constrain food security in 2019, as rice production was curtailed by lack of access to inputs and poor irrigation infrastructures (FAO-GIEWS, June 2019). For instance, poor southern farmers cropped only half of agricultural land in early 2019 because they could not afford to buy seeds and cuttings (FEWS NET, February 2019). Despite the rebound in rice production in 2019, a significant cereal deficit remained and cereal import requirements for 2019/2020 were forecast at 600 000 metric tonnes (FAO-GIEWS, November 2019). However, high prices of local and imported products affected households' purchasing power due to the 10 percent depreciation of the local currency against the USD (FEWS NET, June 2019).\n\nSource: Madagascar IPC Technical Working Group, November 2019.

Three out of 21 regions had a 'high' prevalence - Vatovavy Fitovinany (13 percent), Menabe (11 percent), and Betsiboka (11 percent). With a 'very high' level of children stunted (42 percent), chronic malnutrition is a major public health and development concern in Madagascar, in particular in Vakinankaratra (60 percent) Amoron'i Mania (55 percent) Haute Matsiatra (54 percent), and Bolngolava (52 percent) (MICS, November 2018).\n\nIn the first quarter of 2019, nutrition surveillance in eight southern districts of Madagascar showed a proxy GAM prevalence of 13.3 percent among children under 5 years old. The GAM prevalence was 'very high' in 22 out of 146 communes (UNICEF and WFP, February 2019).\n\nAround 188 550 children were estimated to suffer from acute malnutrition from August 2019-February 2020, with 35 393 severe cases. The district of Bekily was classified in Critical (IPC AMN Phase 4) and Toliara II was in Serious (IPC AMN Phase 3). See map 35.\n\nIn terms of drivers of acute malnutrition, high levels of acute food insecurity in several areas were major contributors. The districts of Ambovombe, Beloha, Tsihombe, Amboasary, Ampanihy and Betioky were facing both Crisis (IPC Phase 3) levels of acute food insecurity and Serious (IPC Phase3) levels of acute malnutrition (IPC, August 2019).\n\nChild-feeding practices in 2018 were far from optimal with half (51 percent) of children under 6 months exclusively breastfed, only 21 percent of children aged 6-23 months consuming a minimum acceptable diet and 25 percent meeting the minimum dietary diversity required for their growth and development (MICS 2018).\n\nLow use of at least basic drinking water services (40 percent) was also a major concern (UNICEF and WHO, 2017). Due to low vaccination rates and poor sanitation and hygiene, Madagascar is regularly hit by epidemics.\n\nThe country faced an unprecedented measles outbreak in 2018-2019, with more than 204 000 registered cases and over 900 measles-related deaths. While the measles epidemic was mostly under control by the end of the year, there is a high possibility that a new epidemic could begin at any time, especially during the rainy season (UNICEF, December 2019).\n\nSource: Madagascar IPC Technical Working Group, August 2019.

The effects of climate shocks are further exacerbated by an estimated national poverty rate of 52 percent, with a higher prevalence in the southern region (NSO, January 2019).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW An estimated 3.3 million people were assessed to be facing Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) levels of acute food insecurity from October 2018-March 2019, marking the peak period for 2019 (IPC, August 2018). Of this number, around 449 200 faced Emergency levels (IPC Phase 4). A very high number (over 5 million) were in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) with minimally adequate food consumption. The situation was worst in the southern part of the country, where 15 districts were classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3).\n\nAs the year progressed, the food security situation was assessed to have improved. From July-September 2019 around 670 000 people were estimated to be in Crisis\n\nIn Malawi many structural issues, including insecure land tenure, lack of irrigation, low access to farm inputs, declines in soil fertility and dominance of maize, which is a thirsty crop, keep yields low and make smallholders extremely vulnerable to adverse weather events.\n\n(IPC Phase 3) and 2.9 million in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) (IPC, August 2019).  But by the start of the lean season in November nearly 1.9 million people were acutely food insecure with nearly all of them classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and a relatively small number (16 700) in Emergency (IPC Phase 4).\n\nWeather extremes Well below-average cereal production in 2018 principally as a result of unfavourable rains in the central and southern regions (maize production fell by 20 percent compared with 2017), and consequently low household-level food stocks, increased households' reliance on markets to meet consumption needs until the harvest in the second quarter of 2019 (FAO-GIEWS, December 2018).\n\nIn early March 2019, cyclone Idai caused severe flooding, crop losses, damage and destruction of homes in 15 districts in southern Malawi, affecting more than 922 000 people, with 59 dead and 677 injured (OCHA, February 2019). Widespread losses of food supplies, damage to standing crops and reduced access to markets aggravated acute food insecurity (IFPRI, March 2019).\n\nFrom mid-2019, food security improved due to increased cereal production in central and northern districts thanks to beneficial seasonal rains. Improved household food supplies and income-generating opportunities from crop sales lessened the need for humanitarian food assistance. In the southern region prolonged periods of dry weather and the impact of Cyclone Idai caused shortfalls in cereal production that sustained high levels of acute food insecurity.\n\nEconomic shocks Prices of maize, the country's key food staple, increased throughout 2019, only punctured by a brief seasonal decline between March and May, before reaching record highs near the end of the year. The early 2019 rise was mostly driven by domestic supply pressure, and while the larger harvest helped to alleviate this pressure in the immediate period following the April-June harvest, it was subsequently offset by heightened demand from importing countries across the subregion (Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia) leading to further price gains.\n\nInstitutional purchases, as the country sought to shore up the national strategic reserves, an upward revision to the farm gate price and a rise in petrol prices, combined to push up maize prices further at the end of the year (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019).\n\nPurchasing power is also constrained by lack of income. Over 60 percent of all older youth and adults work in agriculture, but over a third of the working-age population is economically inactive, primarily youth aged 15-24, women and urban dwellers (IFPRI, May 2019).\n\nMost of Malawi's 45 000 refugees and asylum seekers from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and Rwanda live in the heavily congested Dzaleka Refugee Camp near the capital Lilongwe, which was set up in 1994 for 10 000 people. While many of these refugees have been in the country for\n\nMalawi, IPC Acute food insecurity situation, October 2018- March 2019\n\nSource: Malawi IPC Technical Working Group, August 2018.

The encampment policy limits refugees from accessing land, productive resources or formal employment and restricts freedom of movement. Without income-generating opportunities they are reliant on external assistance to meet their food and other basic needs.\n\nSome 70.3 percent of refugees and asylum seekers in Dzaleka are below the ultra-poverty line (UNHCR and WFP, 2018). Faced with food assistance funding cuts and limited livelihoods opportunities, women and girls resort to harmful coping mechanisms, including transactional sex, for their survival and to support their families (UNHCR, 2018).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW The 2015-16 Demographic and Health Survey found that the child wasting level was low at 2.7 percent. The southern region had higher wasting levels (3.5 percent) than northern (2.1 percent) and central (2 percent) regions (DHS 2015-16).\n\nJust 8.1 percent of children aged 6-23 months consumed the minimum acceptable diet required for their growth and development. Twenty-five percent met minimum dietary diversity and 29.2 percent were fed the minimum frequency of meals. Exclusive breastfeeding rates reduced from 71.4 percent (in 2010) to 61 percent in children below 6 months of age in 2015/16. Inadequate child feeding practices were likely one cause of high anaemia levels (63 percent) among children aged 6-59 months (DHS, 2015-16).\n\nHigh rates of HIV infection also contribute to malnutrition. Almost 9 percent of adults aged 15-49 years old were HIV positive with the urban prevalence (15 percent) double that of the rural (DHS, 2015-16).\n\nNutrition status of refugees Acute malnutrition rates among the refugee and asylum seeker population were very low, with the latest SENS nutrition survey in 2016 reporting a GAM prevalence of just 1 percent. However, chronic malnutrition rates were very high with 34.8 percent of children under 5 years affected by stunting. More than 22.7 percent of refugee children were anaemic. Younger children (around weaning age) were more likely to be malnourished.\n\nNearly 68 percent of children were exclusively breastfed in the first 6 months and 51.4 percent are introduced to complementary food at the age of 6 months. Diarrhoea incidence (27 percent) in children under 5 years in the camp was concerning (SENS 2016). All households accessed water from improved sources but quantities were low and the sources had potential to be contaminated during the rainy season (UNHCR 2017).\n\nSource: Malawi IPC Technical Working Group, January 2020.

Three areas were classified in Crisis (CH Phase 3) in Gao and Timbuktu, and 15 others were in Stressed (CH Phase 2), mainly in Timbuktu, Gao, Kidal, Mopti and Kayes (CILSS-CH, 2019).\n\nThe number of food-insecure people continued increasing throughout 2019, rising from about 336 000 people in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) in March-May to 554 000 in June-August. The number of people in Stressed (CH Phase 2) also increased overall, from around 2.5 million in March-May to 3.2 million in June-August (CILSS-CH, 2019). The central and northern regions were consistently the most affected.\n\nConflict/insecurity Increasing insecurity was characterized by cattle raids, destruction of food stocks and abandonment of pastures, markets, villages and fields in the regions of Mopti, Timbuktu, Gao and Ségou. Despite above-average 2019 cereal production prospects, there were localized shortfalls in Kayes and Mopti. Pastoralists in these areas faced insecurity and limited access to pastures, particularly during the pastoral lean season from April-July (FEWS NET, May 2019). As a result, unusual movements of herds were reported in the centre and north and in neighbouring countries - Mauritania, Burkina Faso, the Niger and Côte d'Ivoire - as well as cattle raids and thefts (Ministry of Agriculture, November 2019). Most economic activities, including fishing, were affected by insecurity in the inner delta of the Niger River (FEWS NET, October 2019).\n\nAs of late November, around 199 000 people were internally displaced, which represents a 140 percent increase since early March 2019, mostly due to violence in Mopti, Gao and Ménaka, and in the bordering areas between Mali and Burkina Faso. In addition, the country hosted around 27 000 refugees mostly from Mauritania, Burkina Faso and the Niger. Around 562 000 IDPs and 74 000 refugees have returned to their homes since the crisis broke out in 2012, (UNHCR, December\n\nMali, CH Acute food insecurity situation, October-December 2019\n\n2019). One in two IDPs depend on humanitarian aid and one in three depend on third person and host communities for their livelihoods (IOM, November 2019).\n\nWeather extremes Mali experienced generally favourable harvests except in areas such as western Sahel, and northern and central parts of the country that were affected by inadequate rainfall and/or insecurity. (FAO, December 2019). Although slightly below 2018 levels, overall, cereal production was 17 percent above the five-year average (FEWS NET, October 2019). Prolonged dry spells were reported in early June and in late September, which led to a reduction in maize planting (FEWS NET, August 2019).\n\nLocalized vegetation stress was detrimental to pastoralist households in western Sahel areas of Kayes, in the north and centre-south of Timbuktu, and localized areas in Gao and Kidal. Floods affected around 90 000 people from June-October mostly in the regions of Mopti, Timbuktu, Segou, Koulikoro and Bamako (Ministry of Agriculture, September 2019) and lowered crop production, particularly in rice-growing areas of the Niger River valley. Flooding also hampered transhumance, leading to livestock concentrations in certain areas (FAO, December 2019).\n\nEconomic shocks Insecurity curtailed trade flows as traders were not able to access livestock and cereal markets in the north, in the areas bordering Burkina Faso and in the Niger Delta. Pasture deficits in western Sahel along with the disruptions to movement in conflict-affected areas, were likely to negatively affect livestock feeding conditions and pastoral households' incomes (FAO, December 2019).\n\nAs of February, insecurity, intercommunal conflicts and border closures disrupted trade flows between Mali and Algeria, Senegal, Benin and Guinea. As a result, in early 2019 prices were above their year-earlier levels in Western Sahel areas of Kayes (OMA et al, February 2019), as well as in Kidal, Ménaka and Mopti (WFP, March 2019). Seven markets - in Timbuktu, Gao, Mopti, Ségou, Kayes and Sikasso - were in Crisis because of elevated price levels and one was in Alert as of April (WFP, April 2019).\n\nHouseholds depleted their stocks earlier than usual in the Niger River valley in Gao and Timbuktu, and in some areas of the Niger River inner delta, and had to resort to negative coping strategies, such as buying food on credit, selling productive assets, begging or migrating - in a context of insecurity and disrupted livelihoods (FEWS NET, October 2019).\n\nIn the regions of Gao and Mopti, livestock exports decreased significantly due to insecurity, which limited traders' physical access to markets (FEWS NET, June 2019). In October, terms of trade were favourable to livestock owners overall, except in Gao, Ménaka and in some areas of Timbuktu (Ministry of Agriculture, November 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW Preliminary results from the SMART survey in 2019 indicate unchanged acute malnutrition levels among children compared to 2018 (DHS, 2019), with 10 percent of children aged 6-59 months affected by wasting, 1.5 percent severely so (SMART, October 2019). This marks a 'high' GAM prevalence. The situation in the northern regions remained concerning with wasting at 'very high' levels exceeding 10 percent in Ménaka (15 percent), Timbuktu (13 percent), Gao (12 percent), Kidal (11 percent) and Taoudenit (11 percent). Severe acute malnutrition rates exceeded 2 percent in Ménaka (2.4 percent) and Timbuktu (2.5 percent) (SMART, October 2019). The stunting rate at national level was 'high' at 22.7 percent, rising to 'very high' in the regions of Sikasso (34.6 percent) and Mopti (31.7 percent).\n\nChild feeding practices in 2019 were very poor with only 10.6 percent of children aged 6-23 months consuming the minimum acceptable diet required for their growth and development. Seventeen percent consumed food from four or more of the possible seven food groups, indicating they met minimum dietary diversity. Minimum meal frequency was adequate for just 37.7 percent of children. Even though breastfeeding was provided to 97 percent of children, exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months was available to only 40.3 percent (SMART, 2019).\n\nThe prevalence of anaemia among children aged 6-59 months was unchanged compared to 2001 levels, and affected 81.9 percent of children. Additionally, 63.4 percent of reproductive -age women were anaemic with the highest prevalence in Kayes region (73 percent). Nationally, anaemia is considered a severe public health problem (DHS, 2019).\n\nAlmost 1 200 cases of measles and 15 cases of yellow fewer had been reported by December (WHO, December 2019).\n\nM O Z A M B I Q U E | M A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9\n\n93 500 Mozambicans were internally displaced.\n\nThere were 4 700 refugees and 20 500 asylum-seekers from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Somalia and Rwanda.\n\nThere were 8 800 Mozambican refugee returnees and 8 800 IDP returnees.\n\nMozambique\n\nAY 2019 UNHCR M\n\nAY 2019 UNHCR M ID-YEAR 2019\n\nW HO 2016 DHS 2011 HRP 2018-2020\n\nPopulation analysed 5M (18% of total population, not including IDPs, returnees and refugees)\n\n1.7M IPC Phase 3 or above in October 2019-February 2020\n\nM OZAM BIQUE IPC TECHNICAL W ORKING GROUP JUNE 2019\n\n1.6M IPC Phase 2 Stressed IPC Phase 3 Crisis IPC Phase 4 Emergency 1.4M 265 000\n\n64% Rural 36% Urban Total population of country 27.9M\n\nINE 2017\n\nMultiple and consecutive extreme weather events destroyed crops, disrupted livelihood systems and triggered food price rises, which significantly worsened acute food insecurity.\n\nAcute food insecurity is expected to persist at similar levels in the first quarter of 2020 as household resilience has been undermined by drought and cyclone-related flooding.\n\nWeather extremes Economic shocks Conflict/insecurity\n\n4Multiple climatic shocks, beginning with poor rains at the start of 2019, caused substantial agricultural losses in the South.\n\n4Tropical Cyclones Idai, Kenneth and Desmond in March and April brought flooding that displaced tens of thousands of people.\n\n4The flooding destroyed crops in key central producing areas, infrastructure and livelihoods.\n\n4Abnormally high prices of staple maize grain constrained purchasing power of poor households.\n\n4Armed violence in northern Cabo Delgado forced people to abandon their homes, crops, livelihoods and assets.\n\n4Drought and floods exacerbated the root causes of acute malnutrition: poor child feeding and care practices, disease and poor access to safe water and sanitation.\n\n60.2% of children under 5 years and 51% of women 15-49 years are anaemic.\n\n28% of children 6-23 months meet the minimum dietary diversity requirement.\n\n43% of children under 6 months are exclusively breastfed.\n\n67 500 children under 5 years are acutely malnourished, of whom 6 500 are affected by SAM.\n\n42.6% of children under 5 years are stunted.\n\nSENS/UNHCR 2015/19\n\nSENS 2015 SENS 2015 71.2% of children under 5 years and 56.5% of pregnant and lactating women are anaemic.\n\n100% of housesholds have access to improved drinking water sources.\n\n68.4% of children under 6 months are exclusively breastfed. 18% of children under 5 years are acutely malnourished in 2 camps.\n\n28.6% of children under 5 years are stunted.\n\nM A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9 | M O Z A M B I Q U E\n\n© W FP/ALEXIS M ASCIARELLI MOZAMBIQUE lean season. Of these around 265 000 were expected to be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4).\n\nThe number in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) was expected to fall from over 1.7 million to 1.6 million as people faced higher levels of acute food insecurity (IPC, July 2019). Of the 39 districts analysed using IPC, it was estimated that from October 2019 at least 30 districts required a combination of urgent interventions such as food assistance, agricultural inputs, infrastructure reconstruction and livelihood support (IPC, July 2019).\n\nAcute food insecurity among refugees After three years of internal political strife in Mozambique, the peace process concluded in 2018 resulted in a revision of the Constitution and the integration of the former combatants of the opposition movement into the armed forces and police. In this stabilizing political context, the majority of the Mozambican asylum-seekers in Zimbabwe were expected to return spontaneously in 2019 (UNHCR, February 2019). By the end of August 2019, there were 8 060 Mozambicans in Zimbabwe awaiting return.\n\nOver 12 000 cases have been awaiting a refugee status determination decision by the Minister of Interior since 2011 (UNHCR, April 2019). Refugees in Maratane refugee camp have the right to work, but over 75 percent rely on food assistance as their main income, while 10 percent rely on crop\n\nBACKGROUND Two decades of peace and stability since the end of the 16-year-long civil war allowed Mozambique to make progress in social and economic terms. The Peace and Reconciliation agreement was signed in July 2019.\n\nAccording to a WB report, poverty fell from 59 percent of the population in 2008 to 48 percent in 2014, but these gains were accompanied by a widening gap between the better-off and the poor, hindering Mozambique's progress in achieving shared prosperity and ranking it among the most unequal countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (WB, November 2018).  \n\nThe southern and central regions are prone to drought, floods frequently occur along major river basins and in poorly drained urban settlements, while coastal areas experience cyclones, storms and flash floods (WFP, January 2020).  \n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW The number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) was expected to increase from almost 1.4 million, representing 27 percent of the population analysed, in April-September 2019 to almost 1.7 million, representing 34 percent of the population analysed, in the October 2019-February 2020\n\nOne month after Tropical Cyclone Idai caused catastrophic damage throughout Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe in March 2019, farmer Maria Rita Charler Tome and her husband sit on the ruins of their mudbrick house. or animal production. Some two-thirds of in-camp refugees had acceptable food consumption, but over half (57 percent) were using high-risk coping strategies such as children contributing to family income, sale of assets and reducing adults consumption for children to eat.\n\nAn estimated 11 percent were 'vulnerable' and 18 percent 'moderately vulnerable' based on food consumption, coping and poverty (WFP, June 2019).\n\nWeather extremes At the beginning of the year a poor performance of the January-March rains in southern areas (Maputo, Gaza and Inhambane) caused substantial agricultural losses (IPC, July 2019).\n\nMozambique was hit by two consecutive tropical cyclones in March and April 2019, killing at least 648 people, injuring nearly 1 700 and leaving an estimated 2.2 million in need of humanitarian assistance and protection. Cyclone Idai made landfall in March 2019, bringing strong winds and torrential rains to Sofala, Zambezia, Tete and Manica provinces and Cyclone Kenneth struck the northern provinces of Cabo Delgado and Nampula six weeks later (HRP, 2019).\n\nIn the affected areas, where more than 80 percent of people are dependent on agriculture as their primary source of income, smallholders suffered major agricultural losses during the critical harvest period following an already-difficult lean season. They suffered destruction of infrastructure, assets and livelihoods. About 0.5 million hectares of crops were destroyed following Cyclone Idai's landfall (FAO, September 2019), while nearly 55 500 hectares were affected by Cyclone Kenneth (OCHA, May 2019).\n\nFarmers in Manica and Sofala - the two provinces hardest hit by Cyclone Idai and the subsequent catastrophic flooding - produce approximately 25 percent of the national cereal output, yet all communities in Manica and 80 percent in Sofala reported harvesting less than half of their maize (OCHA, May 2019). Affected households reported having well belowaverage food stocks, leaving many vulnerable households without the prospect of another full harvest until March 2020 (FAO/WFP, September 2019).\n\nFollowing two consecutive years of below-average production in southern semi-arid areas, most poor households were unable to keep some of their harvested grain to be used as seeds for 2019. The devastating floods caused by Cyclone Idai in the central region again reduced households' ability to retain seeds for the current season and increased their dependence on borrowing or humanitarian assistance (FEWS NET, December 2019). These repeated extremes alter households' recovery capacities and undermine resilience.\n\nMozambique, IPC Acute food insecurity situation, January-March 2019\n\nSource: Mozambique IPC Technical Working Group, October 2018.

The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.\n\nMozambique, IPC Acute food insecurity situation, October 2019-February 2020\n\nWidespread fall armyworm outbreaks adversely affected crop yields, particularly maize crops. Dry weather conditions in some southern and central areas, prior to the cyclones, facilitated the spread of the pest, increasing its damage and impact on crop productivity.\n\nAs a result of the sharp decline in maize production and decrease in paddy output, 2019 cereal production was estimated at 2.8 million tonnes, about 16 percent lower than 2018, but still above the previous five-year average. Production of sorghum and millet was estimated at an above-average level thanks to the crops' greater resilience to water stress and the fact that they are normally planted in higher altitude areas that are less affected by flooding (FAO/WFP, September 2019).\n\nEconomic shocks Economic growth in 2019 slowed due to the losses suffered in the agricultural sector, as well as the disruptive consequences of the cyclones on other sectors, such as transport, housing, industry and commerce, and energy (Government of Mozambique, May 2019).\n\nDue to the impact of climate extremes on agricultural production and to higher year-on-year prices of maize grains in South Africa, a key supplier of maize for southern provinces of Mozambique, prices of white maize grain continued to rise in October and were about 50 percent above their year-earlier levels (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019). The abnormally high prices of staple maize grain were expected to further constrain the purchasing power of poor households. By October, they were relying heavily on market purchase for food (FEWS NET, November 2019).\n\nConflict/insecurity The government is grappling with a low-level so-called Islamic insurgency in parts of the gas-rich northern province of Cabo Delgado (WB, September 2019). Armed violence with attacks on civilians continued to force people to abandon their homes, crops, livelihoods and assets. Villages and health centres have been destroyed.\n\nRecurrent since 2017, the violence has prevented humanitarian organizations from reaching those in need and local populations from accessing basic services, with displaced people and host communities particularly vulnerable. Having lost their harvest to Cyclone Kenneth, people increasingly turned to charcoal production for income because they feared being attacked if they ventured in their fields to plant crops outside Macomia town (ICRC, December 2019).\n\nResults from the annual food security and nutrition analysis (SETSAN) prior to Cyclone Kenneth already showed a concerning food security and nutrition situation in five districts in the north of Cabo Delgado province linked to conflict and violence. Two of the districts (Macomia and Quissanga) were hardest hit by Cyclone Kenneth (OCHA, May 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW The peak of acute malnutrition was expected during the lean season, from October 2019-February 2020, when an estimated 67 500 children under the age of 5 were forecast to need treatment for acute malnutrition, according to the IPC acute malnutrition analysis in 31 of the country's 128 districts in June 2019. An estimated 6 500 of them were affected by severe acute malnutrition (IPC, July 2019).\n\nThe number of districts facing a Serious (IPC Phase 3) situation increased from two in April-September, to six in October 2019-February 2020 with Nicoadala, Maganja da Costa, Balama and Doa deteriorating from Alert (IPC Phase 2) (IPC, July 2019). See map 41.\n\nGenerally, acute malnutrition increased in all analysed districts, particularly those affected by Cyclone Idai and floods (IPC, July 2019). However, the IPC analyses were conducted before Cyclone Kenneth hit Cabo Delgado. The cyclone was likely to reduce the quality and quantity of infant feeding, further increase the occurrence of diarrhoea and malaria, and lower coverage of health and sanitation services and access to safe water sources (OCHA, May 2019).\n\nSince the declaration of the cholera outbreak on 27 March 2019, by July 6 768 suspected cases had been reported in Sofala and 284 cases reported in Cabo Delgado province. An effective cholera vaccination campaign reached 98.6 percent of the population (WHO, July 2019).\n\nNutrition status of refugees There is a lack of recent nutrition data for refugees and asylum seekers. In Maratane camp the acute malnutrition prevalence was 'low' in 2015 (SENS, 2015), but reports from health facilities suggest a 56 percent increase in the number of acutely malnourished children since 2018 (UNHCR 2019). Stunting was 'high' at 28.6 percent and anaemia levels were 'severe' with 71.2 percent of children anaemic (SENS, 2015). Sanitation was poor with 30.8 percent of households practising open defecation due to lack of latrines (SENS, 2015).\n\nMozambique, Acute malnutrition situation, October 2019-February 2020\n\nUrban settlement classification\n\nM A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9 | N I G E R 1.2M children under 5 years are acutely malnourished, of whom 396 500 are affected by SAM.\n\n45.7% of children under 5 years are stunted.\n\nCILSS-CADRE HARM ONISÉ NOVEM BER 2019 1.4M CH Phase 3 or above in October-December 2019\n\n4.5M CH Phase 2 Stressed CH Phase 3 Crisis CH Phase 4 Emergency 1.4M 86 000\n\n84% Rural 16% Urban Total population of country 21.8M\n\nEW S/SAP 2019\n\nNiger\n\nConflict and insecurity, crop losses and floods drove up the number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above).\n\nThe situation is expected to worsen further next year if nothing is done to address the escalation of conflict in the central Sahel and the continuation of violence in Lake Chad.

Acute food insecurity deteriorated between 2018 and 2019 and was particularly severe for displaced people and pastoralists. In 2019, the peak number of people in need of urgent humanitarian food assistance was 82 percent higher than the 2018 peak when 0.8 million were in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) during the lean period.\n\nHowever, the situation was not as dire as the June-August 2014 lean season when 2.2 million in rural areas only were in need of urgent food assistance. Throughout 2019, the population in need of food support steadily rose from 0.7 million in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) in March- May to around 1.2 million during the June-August lean period and peaked at the end of the year (CILSS-CH, November 2019).\n\nAcute food insecurity among refugees According to UNHCR, as of 31 October 2019, the Niger hosted 218 300 refugees, mostly from Nigeria and Mali. This included 161 400 Nigerians, who arrived since 2015, living in three camps and other locations along the Nigerian border and 56 500 Malians, who arrived since 2012, living in four camps and among host communities in Tillabéri and Tahoua. Around 45 000 of the Nigerian refugees arrived recently, living along the border area in Maradi.\n\nRefugees and host communities face factors that erode food security, such as demographic pressure (including high fertility rates), limited agricultural resources and deteriorating security, which limits already scarce economic opportunities. Refugees especially have trouble accessing fertile land.\n\nAn increasing number of Malian refugee households were moderately or severely food insecure compared to 2017 (WFP, 2017 and 2019).1 Targeted food assistance introduced in early 2018 lowered refugees' capacity for self-sufficiency. The arrival of IDPs in the same regions further limited the prospect of the refugee population sustaining itself without food assistance. In the Lake Chad region, the situation remained as challenging as in previous years. Even with food assistance, around a quarter of the 70 000 Malian refugees in formal camps (17 500 people) were in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) in October-December 2019.\n\nConflict/insecurity The Niger's Diffa region of the Lake Chad Basin has experienced violent activity by armed groups since 2014 with security incidents steadily increasing since December 2017 (OCHA, September 2019). Violence has also increased in Tahoua and Tillabéri regions over the last two years. During Based on CARI methodology. 1\n\nNiger, CH Acute food insecurity situation, June-August 2019\n\nApril and May 2019, the security environment deteriorated in border areas with Burkina Faso (OCHA, May 2019). In conflict-affected areas of Diffa, Liptako Gourma, north Tahoua and to a certain extent south Maradi, crop production, trade, markets and livestock mobility were severely disrupted, decreasing food availability (FEWS NET, December 2019).\n\nBy the end of 2019, there were 109 000 IDPs in the Diffa region and 80 800 IDPs in host households in Tahoua and Tillabéri (UNHCR, December 2019) who had lost their livelihoods. In Tahoua and Tillabéri, community solidarity norms require host households to share their food with displaced persons, significantly reducing the quantities consumed in host households (FEWS NET, December 2019).\n\nThe escalating conflict in Mali and Burkina Faso since the end of 2018 led to an increase in the influx of refugees, with the number of Malians reaching 58 000 by the end of the year. There were 119 500 Nigerian refugees in Diffa and 44 800 in Maradi, the latter as a result of community tensions in Zamfara and Sokoto states in Nigeria (UNHCR, December 2019).\n\nWeather extremes Generally, the growing season had medium to good rainfall. However, households in Tillabéri, Maradi, Tahoua and Zinder regions faced cereal deficits caused by rainfall irregularities, pests and floods, in addition to conflict and displacement. This resulted in a gradual dwindling of cereal stocks and an early reliance on markets (FEWS NET, December 2019).\n\nFloods caused by heavy seasonal rains, which began in June, affected over 211 000 people, destroying crops and livestock. In the last week of August, water levels of the Niger basin reached their highest levels since 2012 and overflow from dams in Burkina Faso and Mali contributed to the surging waters. The hardest hit regions were Zinder, Maradi and Agadez (OCHA, September 2019). In the Diffa region, heavy floods in October on irrigated pepper and rice crops damaged livelihoods and food availability.\n\nIn pastoral areas, drought led to a sharp decline in the availability of pasture, which significantly reduced the purchasing power of livestock farming households (FEWS NET, December 2019). The production of biomass (defined as 'above-ground dry plant matter') decreased between 2018 and 2019, with major and recurrent deficits over the last few years in the regions of Tillabéri, Tahoua, Zinder and Diffa, which is having a grave impact on the livelihoods and food security status of pastoralists (ACF, 2019). The 2019-2020 pastoral season recorded a deficit of more than 11 million tonnes of dry matter (Ministère de l'Agriculture, 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW According to the IPC acute malnutrition analysis in December 2019, 918 360 children were acutely malnourished and in need of treatment. The analysis was conducted at the department level in five regions (Agadez, Diffa, Dosso,\n\nNiger, CH Acute food insecurity situation, October-December 2019\n\nMaradi and Zinder) and at the regional level in the remaining three (Tahoua, Niamey and Tillabéri). Tahoua was classified in Serious (IPC Phase 3) and Niamey and Tillabéri in Alert (IPC Phase 2). Out of the 34 departments analysed in the other regions, two were in Critical (IPC Phase 4), 19 in Serious (IPC Phase 3) and 13 in Alert (IPC Phase 2). See map 44.\n\nThe major contributing factors to acute malnutrition varied from one unit of analysis to the other. Insecurity in the regions of Diffa, Tillabéri, Tahoua and Maradi was likely to have affected the nutritional status of children. Household acute food insecurity appeared to be a minor contributing factor in most of the areas analysed.\n\nThis grave malnutrition situation can be largely attributed to child feeding practices. Just 21.1 percent of children under six months were exclusively breastfed and only 6.3 percent of children aged 6-23 months received the minimum acceptable diet for their growth and development (SMART, 2019).\n\nAnaemia was another major concern for malnutrition, affecting 61.2 percent of children aged 6-59 months and 45.1 percent of reproductive-age women (SMART, 2019). Poor access to safe drinking water and poor hygiene and sanitation conditions also contributed to the Niger's high levels of acute malnutrition. Only half of households had access to an improved source of drinking water within a 30-minute walk round trip from their home. The gap between rural (44 percent) and urban areas was significant (84 percent) (UNICEF and WHO, 2017).\n\nThe deteriorating security situation in bordering areas of Burkina Faso, Mali and Nigeria limited access to health services. As of 18 December 2019, four health centres and 47 health posts had closed due to insecurity in crisis-affected areas (WHO, December 2019). The high prevalence of malaria, diarrhoea and respiratory infections were also some of the major contributors to malnutrition in at least 18 out of the 34 departments analysed (IPC AMN 2019). In 2019, a total of 10 727 suspected cases of measles with 55 confirmed cases were reported in eight regions of the country, but the case incidence gradually decreased following the vaccination campaign in September (WHO, December 2019).\n\nAt 45.7 percent, stunting levels were 'very high' in children aged 6-59 months, reaching 55.4 percent in Maradi and 52.9 percent in Zinder (SMART, 2019).\n\nNutrition status of refugees Nutrition surveys conducted in host and refugee populations showed a 'high' to 'very high' percentage of children affected by wasting in five refugee camps and settlements (12- 16.1 percent GAM) (SENS, 2016). Four out of five of the camps and settlements documented SAM prevalence higher than 2 percent. Chronic malnutrition was also highly concerning, with stunting above critical levels (40 percent) in all camps/ settlements (SENS, 2018). In 2016, 35.5 percent of households in Sayam Forage camps and 32.6 percent in Kbalew were not consuming micronutrient-rich foods (SENS, 2016).\n\nNiger, IPC Acute malnutrition situation, June-October 2019\n\nSource: Niger IPC Technical Working Group, January 2020.

The situation appears to be getting worse as Islamic extremist groups grow stronger across the region (FEWS NET, February 2020). Climate change and a growing population is putting pressure on land, with growing tensions and violence between pastoralists and farmers leading to a lack of investment and failure to maximize the country's vast agricultural potential. Levels of poverty, especially in the north, remain stubbornly high, with half the people in Africa's most populous country estimated to be living on less than USD1.90/day (WB, April 2019).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW Acute food insecurity levels peaked from July-August 2019 when the number of people in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) reached almost 5 million, representing five percent of the population analysed in the 16 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The figure included around 3 million people in the three states (known as BAY states) of northeastern Nigeria, most of them in Borno (1.8 million), Yobe (945 000), and Adamawa (279 000). All 412 000 people\n\nSoon after arriving in Teachers' Village Camp in Borno state in early 2019, this 20-year-old woman gave birth to a son. She had been hiding in the bush for days with no food or water following attacks by insurgents. classified in Emergency (CH Phase 4) were in these three states (CILSS-CH, June 2019). The remaining two million who faced Crisis (CH Phase 3) conditions were mainly in Sokoto, Katsina, Zamfara, Kaduna, Plateau, Bauchi and Gombe.\n\nInaccessible areas in north-eastern Nigeria were also likely experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (REACH, June 2019, ECHO, November 2019) but could not be classified within the CH protocols because they were not accessible for enumerators to gather data. Of the 61 accessible or partially accessible Local Government Areas in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, 29 were classified in Crisis (CH Phase 3) and one - Kala Balge in Borno - in Emergency (CH Phase 4). Another 20 LGAs were classified in Stressed (CH Phase 2).\n\nAcross the 16 states analysed and FCT, 18.8 million people, or 18 percent of the population analysed, were in Stressed (CH Phase 2).\n\nThe 2019 peak figure of acutely food-insecure people for the 16 states and FCT was slightly lower than the 2018 peak of 5.3 million people in June-August 2018 and 45 percent lower than June-August 2017 (8.9 million). However, the situation showed little improvement in the north-eastern areas.\n\nAlthough the number in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) decreased by around 18 percent to 4 million in October- December 2019 in line with seasonal patterns, the situation remained dire in the north-eastern conflict-affected areas with 22 still classified in Crisis (CH Phase 3). In the rest of the areas analysed more than 80 percent of the population was in Minimal (CH Phase 1) but still thousands were in Crisis (CH Phase 3) outside Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, with the highest number in Kano (429 000) and Kaduna (192 000).\n\nAcute food insecurity among displaced people The number of displaced people as a result of the insurgency in the north-east is currently estimated at 2 million in six states (IOM, November 2019). The forcibly displaced populations have very limited livelihood opportunities and their food security remains precarious without humanitarian aid (CILSS-CH, 2019 and FEWS NET, October 2019). The November 2019 CH analysis in camps in Borno shows that humanitarian assistance has not met the food security needs of all households. Around 262 000 IDPs were in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above), in addition to 251 000 in Stressed (CH Phase 2) - out of a total of 680 000 IDPs analysed. Host populations also face great pressure on their livelihoods and resources, while returnees wrestle to reconstruct their livelihoods due to the destruction of their assets.\n\nAn additional 540 000 people are displaced by communal clashes and banditry in north-west and north-central areas (IOM, 2019), mainly in Benue and Plateau, while Sokoto, Katsina and Zamfara also have a large proportion of displaced populations, mainly living in host communities (IOM, 2019).\n\nNigeria, CH Acute food insecurity situation, June-August 2019\n\nSource: CILSS-Cadre Harmonisé, November 2019.. The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.\n\nNigeria, CH Acute food insecurity situation, October-December 2019\n\nConflict/insecurity Although conflict occurred in fewer areas compared to previous years, north-eastern Nigeria saw an intensification of armed violence in 2019, especially in Borno state. By the end of the year there were an estimated 1.8 million IDPs in the region, the highest number since August 2016, with 92 percent of them displaced by the insurgency and 8 percent by climate events (UNHCR, accessed 24 January 2019).\n\nDespite IDPs' high dependence on humanitarian aid (CILSSCH 2019), humanitarian access to Boko Haram-affected areas was constrained by the volatile security situation, restrictions on movement and poor road infrastructure (ACAPS, October 2019). Some 800 000 people in north-east Nigeria could not be reached with aid as of January, and this number likely increased throughout the year (REACH 2019; FEWS NET, 2019).\n\nWith insecurity preventing them from accessing their land, only 50 percent of households in Borno and around a third in Yobe and Adamawa were able to sow crops in the 2019 season (CILSS-CH, 2019.) The conflict also limited pastoralists' access to grazing areas and veterinary services (FAO-GIEWS, September 2019).\n\nInsecurity in Benue, Plateau, Katsina, Zamfara and Sokoto states prevented people from engaging in normal livelihood activities. In Plateau, conflict between herders and farmers reduced the area planted, and crop production was below-average (CILSS-CH, 2019). In some areas, harvests were either looted or burned by bandits. Traders avoided affected areas due to fear of attacks, limiting trade flows and market supplies in some of the worst-affected parts of Katsina and Zamfara states. In some areas of Katsina, growing tall crops such as maize, millet, and sorghum was restricted within distances of 1-2 kilometres of settlements for fear of attacks by bandits, limiting local staple production to short crops, such as rice, cowpeas, groundnuts and sweet potatoes (FEWS NET, June 2019).\n\nWhile price of coarse grains had remained mostly stable or declined in October 2019 compared to their year-earlier levels, prices of rice increased significantly, mainly as a result of lower supplies after the Government of Nigeria unilaterally closed the border with the Niger, Cameroon and Chad as a security and trade protectionist measure (In August 2019, (WFP and FEWS NET, October 2019). High prices were also reported for coarse grains, vegetables and livestock products in border markets, and more significantly in the north-east as a result of the insurgency (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019).\n\nWeather extremes Seasonal rainfall and subsequently high water levels in the Niger and Benue rivers caused flooding across 32 of the 36 states and FCT from June-October, affecting over 210 000 people, displacing about 130 000 and causing crop damage to varying degrees across the country (IFRC EPoA October 2019).\n\nIn the north-eastern states, especially in Borno, the torrential rainfalls and flash floods adversely affected thousands of people in IDP camps and host communities (OCHA, August 2019). In October, more than 100 000 people were affected in Adamawa by the state's worst floods in 17 years. A total of 19 000 people were displaced and the Government set up nine camps in seven LGAs to house them (OCHA, December 2019). In early November, more than 40 000 men, women and children - mostly IDPs - had little or no access to food or services in the remote conflict-affected town of Rann, Borno state, following heavy river flooding in neighbouring Cameroon. The flooding damaged an estimated 4 000 hectares of farmland, destroying crops that are the main source of food for IDPs (OCHA, November 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW Nationally, 7 percent of children aged 6-59 months suffered from wasting, which is considered a 'medium' prevalence. Of them 1.5 percent were affected by severe wasting. The wasting prevalence in the three crisis-affected states was 'high' in Borno (10.6 percent) and 'medium' in Yobe (8.9 percent) and Adamawa (7.1 percent). Elsewhere, Jigawa, bordering Yobe in the north, had the highest GAM prevalence (12.5 percent) followed by Sokoto (9.8 percent) and Bauchi (9.4 percent) (NNHS 2018).\n\nOverall, 32 percent of children aged 6-59 months were stunted, which is considered a 'very high' prevalence. The prevalence was even higher in the BAY states, reaching an alarming 55.8 percent in Yobe, followed by 39.4 percent in Adamawa and 37.3 percent in Borno. Out of the 37 states covered in this analysis, stunting was considered 'very high' in 16, with six of them having a prevalence of over 50 percent (NNHS 2018).\n\nNationally, the exclusive breastfeeding rate was low at 27.2 percent. Only 16.5 percent of children aged 6-23 months met the minimum acceptable diet for their growth and development. Minimum meal frequency was 40.2 percent and only 34.5 percent of children of this age consumed at least five out of eight food groups, which is the threshold for minimum dietary diversity (NNHS 2018). These child-feeding practices - already poor at the national level - are exacerbated in areas of protracted conflict where access to health and nutrition services are denied and food availability and access are compromised.\n\nAnaemia was another major concern for malnutrition as more than two thirds of children aged 6-59 months (67.9 percent) and more than half of women of reproductive age (57.8 percent) were anaemic. (DHS 2018).\n\nAround 30 percent of households were not able to use at least basic drinking water services (WHO and UNICEF 2017) and less than half of households (46.8 percent) had access to improved sanitation facilities (NNHS 2018).\n\nIn many locations in Borno state, access challenges restricted the movement of mobile medical teams, ambulances, immunisation and medical supplies (WHO, January 2020). The crisis-affected areas were at high risk of infectious disease outbreaks. In Adamawa 895 suspected cases of cholera had been reported by November 2019. By November 2019, there had been 58 916 suspected cases of measles in 36 states, including crisis-affected ones (WHO, January 2020).\n\nM A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9 | P A K I S T A N ( B A L O C H I S T A N A N D S I N D H D R O U G H T - A F F E C T E D A R E A S )\n\nAround 96 000 Pakistanis were internally displaced.\n\nThere were 1.4M registered refugees from Afghanistan, 324 200 in Balochistan and 64 000 in Sindh.\n\nThere were over 83 000 Pakistani IDP returnees.\n\nA severe locust infestation is likely to affect domestic food production and vulnerable agropastoral populations.

In Sindh, 1.28 million people (57 percent of the rural population) in seven districts were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) from October-July 2019. Of these, almost 600 000 people were in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). Drought-affected areas of four districts were in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) (IPC, July 2019).\n\nWeather extremes Temperature rises, El Niño conditions and a decrease in monsoon rainfall have increased the frequency and severity of drought. The 2018 monsoon season rains were almost 70 percent below average in Sindh and 45 percent below average in Balochistan. This resulted in acute shortages of water, food and fodder into 2019.\n\nIn January 2019, the Government of Sindh declared some south-eastern and western districts as calamity-hit areas, while a province-wide nutrition and drought emergency was declared in Balochistan (OCHA, March 2019). Despite moderate 2019 summer monsoon rains, the effects of the drought in Balochistan were expected to persist (USAID, September 2019).\n\nBACKGROUND With a rural poverty headcount close to 50 percent, Sindh and Balochistan have the highest rural poverty rates among Pakistan's provinces and the highest urban-rural poverty gaps (WB, March 2019). The provinces have experienced drought conditions since 2013 and 2016, and the situation worsened during the last quarter of 2018 with adverse effects on rural livelihoods, cereal production and livestock (IPC, July 2019).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW Over 3 million people - representing more than half of the population analysed in 21 rural, drought-affected districts in Balochistan and Sindh provinces - were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) in October 2018-July 2019. Of these, more than 1 million people faced Emergency (IPC Phase 4) conditions. An additional 1.4 million people were in Stressed (IPC Phase 2). The food security situation was not expected to improve in the latter half of the year (IPC, July 2019).\n\nIn Balochistan, 1.79 million people (48 percent of the rural population) in 14 drought-affected districts were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) in January-July 2019. Of these, around 420 000 people were in Emergency (IPC Phase 4).

Since 2013, prolonged drought/drought-like conditions have persisted in south-eastern and western parts of the country.\n\nThe vast majority (87 percent) of households in droughtaffected districts in Sindh own livestock (NDS, January 2019). Since 2013, fodder production has been low and water availability limited, leading to livestock diseases, deaths and distress sales of animals (IPC, July 2019).\n\nHeavy rains in February 2019 resulted in severe flash floods in six districts of Balochistan. Additional heavy rains in April caused floods in most districts of Balochistan and Sindh (IFRC, October 2019), while monsoon rains flooded several districts of Sindh in August (ECHO, August 2019).\n\nEconomic shocks Half of the population of drought-affected districts are subsistence-level crop producers (NDS, January 2019), whose reliance on markets increases when they face lack of water for irrigation and decreased production of cereals and pulses (IPC, July 2019). Two-thirds were spending a high proportion of their total expenditures (65 percent or more) on food (NDS, January 2019), signifying their vulnerability if confronted with food price rises.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, all five WFP-monitored markets met the criteria to be categorized in crisis based on the Alert for Price Spikes (ALPS) indicator (WFP, October 2019). Between July 2018 and 2019 the market price of wheat and/ or wheat flour increased by 9 percent, that of basmati rice by 12 percent and pulses by 13-40 percent (WFP, August 2019).\n\nThe food element of the Consumer Price Index increased by 2.4 percent between October and November 2019 and by 16.5 percent between November 2018 and 2019 (PBS, November 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW According to the 2018 National Nutrition Survey, child malnutrition in its different forms remains critical despite improvements in other socioeconomic indicators. Acute malnutrition rates measured by wasting were above 'very high' levels at 17.7 percent, up from 15 percent in 2011 and 8.6 percent in 1997. Rates were even higher in Balochistan and Sindh - the latter having the highest rates in Pakistan, affecting close to a quarter of children (NNS, June 2019).\n\nAccording to the IPC acute malnutrition analysis, around 1.4 million children aged 6-59 months were in need of treatment for acute malnutrition in the 22 drought-affected districts from May-August 2019. In Balochistan's 14 droughtaffected districts almost 400 000 children were wasted, half of them severely so. In Sindh, over 1 million were wasted, 365 200 of them severely so. Sixteen of the 22 droughtaffected districts were classified as Critical (IPC AMN Phase 4), while Panjgur district in Balochistan and Umerkot and Tharparkar in Sindh were classified as Extremely Critical (IPC AMN Phase 5) (IPC, November 2019).

Palestinians increasingly resorted to negative coping mechanisms, such as withdrawing children from school (OCHA, January 2020).\n\nAcute food insecurity among refugees Palestine refugees are defined as \"persons whose normal place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict.\" The descendants of Palestine refugee males, including adopted children, are also eligible for refugee registration (UNRWA, accessed January 2020). Across the region there are around 5.5 million refugees with more than 1.7 million of them living in 58 recognized Palestine refugee camps2 in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, Based on WFP CARI methodology. 2 Defined as a plot of land placed at the disposal of UNRWA by the host government to 1 accommodate Palestine refugees with facilities to cater for their needs. UNRWA also maintains schools, health centres and distribution centres in areas outside the recognized camps where Palestine refugees are concentrated, such as Yarmouk, near Damascus.\n\nBACKGROUND The protracted conflict between Israel and Palestine continued to have a severe humanitarian impact on Palestinians in 2019, chiefly in the Gaza Strip as well as in Area C of the West Bank and East Jerusalem (OCHA, December 2019). Palestinians in these areas face restricted movement of people and goods, limited access to land, water and basic services, recurrent expropriation of land, property and assets, settler violence, civil unrest and periodic large-scale armed hostilities (UNCTAD, July 2016). The situation is aggravated by internal political divisions between the administrations of the West Bank and Gaza (ACAPS, May 2019).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW Around 1.7 million Palestinians are food insecure and in need of assistance (OCHA, 2020). The majority of them live in the Gaza Strip and the remainder in the West Bank.\n\nThe most recent available food security data was gathered in September 2018. It showed that food insecurity was particularly severe and worsening in the Gaza Strip where the prevalence of food-insecure people increased from 59 percent in 2014 to 68.5 percent in 2018. Of these some 47 percent were severely food insecure and 22 percent moderately food\n\nMaram, a six-year-old girl, lives with her seven siblings in Gaza City where a 12-year economic blockade, rampant poverty and high unemployment makes uninterrupted food assistance critical. including East Jerusalem, as well as in Jordan, Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic (UNRWA, May 2019).\n\nIn Gaza, over 70 percent of the population (1.4 million Palestinians) are refugees. Almost 600 000 of them live in eight camps, which have some of the highest population densities in the world (UNRWA). The West Bank is home to around 850 000 Palestine refugees (UNRWA, May 2019), a quarter of whom live in camps.\n\nThe proportion of food-insecure refugees in the Gaza Strip increased between 2015 and 2018 from 57 percent to 67 percent. But at 70 percent an even higher percentage of non-refugees in Gaza were food insecure, up from 63 percent in 2014. In the West Bank, the food security of refugees improved between 2014 and 2018 - with the percentage of food insecure falling from 20 percent to 14 percent. There was a particularly significant improvement in refugee camps in the West Bank, with the percentage of food insecure falling from 21 percent in 2014 to 8 percent in 2018 (FSC, December 2018).\n\nConflict/insecurity The prolonged occupation, blockade on Gaza and outbreaks of hostilities have eroded the resilience of Palestinians. They are increasingly less able to cope with sudden shocks, such as spikes in conflict, demolitions in the West Bank, and natural or environmental hazards, such as winter storms, the longer term effects of climate change, inadequate water and sanitation services and electricity cuts (OCHA, January 2020).\n\nThe situation in Gaza remained particularly fragile. The Great March of Return demonstrations since March 2018, calling for Israeli authorities to lift their blockade on Gaza and to allow Palestinian refugees to return to their villages and towns inside what is now Israel continued (Amnesty International, accessed January 2020).\n\nAid workers experience movement restrictions and difficulties in getting visas to access Gaza. The Israeli government bans the import of specific humanitarian items into Gaza, and Hamas imposes restrictions on humanitarian operations within the Gaza Strip. Confiscation of aid is common from all sides, including both Israeli and Palestinian authorities in the West Bank and Gaza (ACAPS, October 2019).\n\nIn the West Bank, settlement activity and related violence, loss of land, the demolition and threat of demolition of infrastructure, movement restrictions, and impeded access to basic services and livelihoods, including farming and grazing lands, as well as poor law enforcement on violent settlers continued (OCHA, December 2019). By the end of November,\n\nPalestinians had been displaced in the West Bank as a result of demolitions, almost double the 2018 number (OCHA, December 2019). 815\n\nAccording to FAO, in the West Bank - where the olive sector provides primary or secondary sources of income for between 80 000 and 100 000 families - the olive yield in 2019 was estimated to reach a record 27 000 tonnes, an 84 percent increase over the previous year. However, in some areas, the realization of a potential record yield was compromised by access restrictions to groves and attacks and intimidation (OCHA 2019).\n\nEconomic shocks Despite a slight improvement in the Gazan economy in 2019 (growing by 1.8 percent, following a steep recession of almost seven percent in 2018) unemployment rates increased from 43 percent in 2018 to almost 47 percent in the second quarter of 2019, with youth unemployment at 64 percent, the highest rate in the world (WB, September 2019).\n\nThe humanitarian situation in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, was less acute than in Gaza, but growth in 2019 was expected to slow to the lowest level of the last five years (1.2 percent), down from 3.1 percent in 2018 (WB, September 2019). Economic development is undermined by occupation, administrative and physical constraints, and by limitations on Palestinian access to land and natural resources especially in Area C, which makes up over 60 percent of the West Bank (OCHA, January 2020).\n\nIn June, a WFP survey in Gaza and the West Bank found that poor vulnerable communities were resorting to negative coping mechanisms and falling into a cycle of indebtedness to meet their most pressing needs.\n\nIn Gaza, more than 80 percent of households had debts of between USD 1 810 and USD 3 498, made up of unpaid bills for electricity and water, grocery shopping and lines of credit with friends and relatives. Nearly half (48 percent) of those interviewed reported an increased trend in purchasing food on credit compared to the previous month.\n\nIn the West Bank, 48 percent had debts ranging from USD 1 796 to USD 3 418. Around 63 percent said they were more likely to purchase food on credit compared to the previous month (WFP, June 2019).\n\nA recent World Bank report called for a review of the Israeli application of the system for dual use goods as it limits economic diversification and sustainable growth in the Palestinian territories. In agriculture the dual use restrictions have lowered the concentration of active chemicals in fertilizers making them less effective and lowering land productivity to half of that in Jordan and only 43 percent of the yield in Israel (WB, April 2019).\n\nSource: WFP, 2018\n\nPalestine, Number of food-insecure people by governorate, 2019\n\nIn April, the permissible fishing area along the southern and central parts of Gaza's coast was expanded from 6 to 15 nautical miles (NM) offshore, the furthest distance that Gaza's fishers have been permitted to access since 2000. Access to the northern areas along the coast remained at up to 6 NM, well below the 20 NM agreed under the Oslo Accords (OCHA, November 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW While the national acute malnutrition was 'low' in 2014 (MICS, 2014), it reached 14 percent in Gaza strip in 2019. In addition, 18 percent of pregnant and 14 percent of lactating women were malnourished in 2019 (UNICEF, 2019).\n\nJust 39 percent of children were exclusively breastfed in the first 6 months of life. The relatively high levels of bottle-fed children were concerning, particularly for children in Gaza where water is likely to be contaminated (UNICEF, accessed January 2020). The lack of growth in exclusive breastfeeding over the past years is mainly due to aggressive marketing of breast milk substitutes and a lack of clarity regarding optimal infant-feeding practices. Only 14 percent of young children in Gaza received a minimum acceptable diet for their growth and development (UNICEF, 2019). A high proportion were not eating iron-rich foods, increasing the risk of iron deficiency anaemia (UNICEF, 2019).\n\nWhile there has been an improvement in the daily availability of electricity, and the supply of water and waste water treatment since October 2018, the quality of basic services remained extremely poor in Gaza, particularly access to safe water and risk of winter flooding or exposure to environmental health risks along the Gaza shoreline. In the West Bank, poor service provisions and demolitions, particularly in Area C, remain a concern (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nThe protracted conflict, alongside sudden shocks, is overwhelming an already overburdened health system (OCHA, January 2020). The dual-use restrictions on medical equipment and a shortage of medical supplies are major contributors to the evolving health crisis in Gaza. The hospitals have limited capacity to manage injuries that require complex treatment including health services for women and children (UNICEF, September 2019).\n\n0-15 000\n\n30 001-100 000\n\n> 250 000\n\n15 001-30 000\n\n100 001-250 000\n\nNumber of food-insecure people\n\nThe boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.

Around 69 percent of the population lives in poverty, with higher rates among rural and IDP populations (WB, April 2019). Severe drought in 2010/11 resulted in a Famine (IPC Phase 5) in parts of southern Somalia (FSNAU and FEWS NET, September 2011). The 2016/17 drought created an increased risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5) that was only brought under control by sustained, large- scale humanitarian assistance and improvements in weather conditions in 2017 (FSNAU, 2017).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW An estimated 2.1 million people faced Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) during October-December 2019 in the absence of humanitarian assistance. This included 439 000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). Areas of major concern included the Guban pastoral and Bay-Bakool low potential agropastoral livelihood zones in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and central and northern pastoral and agropastoral zones in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). An additional 4.2 million people were classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2).\n\nFatuma Abdulah sits in the shade with her children in El Jalle village, Belet Weyne district, where devastating flooding by the Shabelle river prompted an estimated 273 000 people to flee their homes in October-November 2019.\n\nMost urban centres faced Stressed (IPC Phase 2) or Minimal (IPC Phase 1) acute food insecurity due to stable food prices and employment opportunities. However, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) conditions were observed in Awdal, Hiraan, Sanaag and Sool regions (IPC, February 2019 and September 2019).\n\nAcute food insecurity deteriorated over the course of 2019, reaching its peak in October-December. However, that number was lower than the 2018 peak (2.7 million people in February-June) when households were still recovering from the 2016/17 severe drought (IPC, February 2018 and 2019).\n\nAcute food insecurity among displaced people The IDP population remained relatively stable compared to 2018 at 2.6 million while the refugee population (from Ethiopia followed by Yemen) increased by 9 percent to 35 600. Returnee flows slowed significantly from 10 800 in 2018 and 36 700 in 2017 to 3 700 in 2019, mainly from Kenya and Yemen (UNHCR, November 2018 & 2019). Displaced people encounter difficulties in accessing labour opportunities and the poverty rate is high among them (WB, 2019). They face vulnerability to illness due to inadequate sanitation in IDP settlements (FEWS NET, October 2019). In 14 key IDP sites assessed, households in receipt of humanitarian assistance faced Stressed (IPC Phase 2) or Crisis (IPC Phase 3) conditions (IPC, September 2019).\n\nWeather extremes In late 2018, the October-December Deyr rains were late and below average with much of central Somalia, as well as parts of the north, receiving rainfall that was only 25-50 percent of average (IPC, February 2019). Subsequently, Gu (April- June) rains started in late April, after almost a month characterized by drought conditions, which severely affected crop germination and establishment in southern key cerealproducing areas.\n\nAbundant precipitation in May did not significantly improve crop prospects as it occurred too late during the growing season (FAO-GIEWS, July 2019) and the Gu harvest in central and southern Somalia was estimated at 60 percent below-average, the lowest since 1995 and even lower than the pre-famine Gu harvest of 2011 (FSNAU and FEWS NET, September 2019).\n\nThe Gu-Karan April-September rains in north-western Somalia were also characterized by early season dryness, but heavy late season rains in August and September boosted yields, and cereal production was above the average of the previous five years (FAO-GIEWS calculations based on FSNAU data).\n\nSubsequently, central and southern Somalia received well above average 2019 October-December Deyr rains, with many areas experiencing rainfall that was more than three times the average (NOAA, October 2019).\n\nThe abundant precipitation was generally beneficial for agricultural production, and the output of the secondary Deyr harvest was estimated at about 35 percent above the average of the previous five years (FAO-GIEWS, March 2020).\n\nHowever, the torrential rains also caused widespread flooding, affecting 547 000 people and displacing 370 000 (OCHA,\n\nNot analyzed\n\nIDP settlement-colour depicts phase\n\nUrban settlement-colour depicts phase\n\nArea would likely be at least one phase worse without effects of humanitarian assistance Source: Somalia IPC Technical Working Group, February 2019.

Substantial flood-induced crop losses were recorded in riverine main maize-growing areas along the Shabelle and Juba rivers, infrastructure and roads were destroyed, and livelihoods disrupted in some of the worst-hit areas (WFP, October 2019).\n\nOverall, the aggregate 2019 cereal production was estimated at 186 000 tonnes, about 10 percent below the 2018 bumper output and 20 percent below the average of the previous five years.\n\nPastoral areas were also affected by a poor performance of the Gu rains, with drought conditions prevailing in April. Late season rains in May helped to partially, but not fully, replenish pastoral resources.\n\nHowever, many pastoral households that had already lost much of their herds during the 2016/17 drought, faced reduced milk availability from their remaining stock and took on large debts to cover basic food and non-food needs (FSNAU and FEWS NET, September 2019). Pasture, browse and water availability markedly improved with the abundant October- December Deyr rains.\n\nThe availability of saleable animals as well as milk availability for household consumption continued to gradually improve. However, many poor households were still unable to meet their minimum food needs without selling their animals to the point of endangering the sustainability of their herds and their livelihoods (FSNAU and FEWS NET, February 2020).\n\nPrices of sorghum declined in December in southern key markets, including the capital Mogadishu, by 5-15 percent in anticipation of the Deyr harvest, while prices of maize followed mixed trends, increasing in some markets due to the expected crop losses in main maize growing areas. Prices of coarse grains in December 2019 were about 30 percent higher than in the same month of the previous year, mainly due to a tight supply situation following the drought-reduced 2019 Gu main season harvest (FAO-GIEWS, March 2020). As of November 2019, the cost of a minimum basket (CMB) was above the fiveyear average in the Banadir, Juba, North-east, North-west and Sorghum Belt regions (FSNAU, November 2019).\n\nConflict/insecurity Clan disputes, protests, the weakness of the national forces, the gradual withdrawal of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), Islamic State and continuing Al Shabaab attacks continued to cause insecurity and instability, disrupting livelihoods, markets, trade flows and humanitarian access and forcing Somalis to abandon fields and productive assets (ACAPS, June 2019 and FSNAU, October 2019).\n\nACLED data indicated that there were approximately 2 400 conflict events in Somalia in 2019, resulting in 3 800 fatalities. Though still very high, this data indicates a slight decline compared to 2018 levels with conflict events down by 15 percent and fatalities down by 26 percent (ACLED, 2019).\n\nSource: Somalia IPC Technical Working Group, September 2019. The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW About 1.3 million boys, girls, pregnant and lactating women suffer from acute malnutrition, with 180 000 children under 5 years suffering from life-threatening severe malnutrition (OCHA, January 2020).\n\nThe 2019 post-Gu season nutrition assessment, conducted in June-July, showed a similar median GAM estimate (14 percent) to that of 2018 (13.8 percent), and a nonstatistically significant decrease when compared to Gu 2017 (17.4 percent) (FSNAU/FEWS NET, September 2019).\n\nThe percentage of children with SAM was 2.3 percent - up from 2 percent in Gu 2018, but better than 3.2 percent in Gu 2017, which was an exceptionally difficult year characterized by severe drought in some parts of the country, particularly in the central south regions, leading to high levels of acute malnutrition. In Gu 2019 the average SAM rate was higher in rural areas (3 percent) compared to urban (2.1 percent). For IDPs the mean estimates were higher at 18 percent for GAM and 3.5 percent for SAM (FSNAU/FEWS NET, September 2019).\n\nIn the post-Deyr assessment conducted in November 2019, preliminary results of surveys conducted among IDPs and urban populations indicated a GAM prevalence of 13.1 percent, reflecting a slight increase since the 2018 Deyr (11.7 percent) and 2019 Gu (12.9 percent) for these populations. Furthermore, the acute malnutrition situation in 4 out of the 22 IDP or urban population groups surveyed showed 'very high' levels with GAM above 15 percent, in Mogadishu, Galkayo, Boosaaso and Baidoa. This may reflect widening food consumption gaps, in light of low income and declining humanitarian food assistance levels in some settlements, as well as increased morbidity. In November, morbidity among children was high (≥20 percent) in 13 out of 22 population groups surveyed, with five IDP settlements showing a prevalence above 30 percent (FSNAU/FEWS NET, February 2020).\n\nA publication analysing data from 2007-2016 showed that IDP households were consistently more likely to suffer from malnutrition and morbidity than non-displaced populations (Martin-Canavate et al, 2020). In the post-Gu analysis, the average GAM rate for IDPs was 18 percent and the SAM rate was 3.5 percent (FSNAU/FEWS NET, September 2019).\n\nThe 2019 floods raised the risk of AWD/cholera outbreaks especially in central-south Somalia. Episodes of prolonged diarrhoea are also associated with increased morbidity and mortality from other diseases, adverse neuro-development and growth stunting. The incidence of measles in this period was also very high. According to joint WHO and Somalia Federal Ministry of Health reports, nearly 1 257 measles cases were reported from January-August 2019, keeping the outbreak at epidemic levels. In the same period, 1 909 cases of AWD/cholera were reported, an increase of 48 percent since June-August 2018 (FSNAU/FEWS NET, October 2019).\n\nSource: Somalia IPC Technical Working Group, August 2019.

Of these, 21 000 were facing Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) and 1.8 million Emergency (IPC Phase 4). Additionally, 3.2 million were classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and at risk of falling into worse levels of acute food insecurity classification (IPC, June 2019).\n\nThe 21 000 people facing Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) were located in Canal/Pigi (former Jonglei state), Cueibet (former Lakes state), and Panyikang (former Upper Nile State) and were the greatest source of concern in 2019 (IPC, June 2019).\n\nAccording to the August 2019 IPC analysis conducted before the floods, the acute food insecurity situation was expected to improve in the course of the year as farmers began to harvest, with 6.35 million people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) in August, reducing to 4.54 million (39 percent of the population) in September-December (IPC, September 2019).\n\nCompared with 2018 (IPC, September 2018), the 2019 acute food insecurity peak increased by 15 percent with 894 000 more people classified in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) in 2019 (IPC, June 2019).\n\nSouth Sudan has 1.46 million IDPs, 13 percent of them living in six UNMISS Protection of Civilians sites (UNHCR, October 2019). It also hosts 290 000 refugees and asylum seekers, chiefly from the Sudan (92 percent) followed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo (6 percent).\n\nPoor dietary diversity and a high prevalence of negative coping strategies have been observed among refugee populations. Some 71-80 percent of refugee households reported using one or more negative coping strategies1 to fulfil their food needs. Most of the refugees rely on food assistance and approximately 60 percent of refugee households employ emergency livelihood coping strategies (FSNMS Round 24, September 2019).\n\nConflict/insecurity Following the beginning of peace talks in mid-2018, and the signing in September 2018 of the R-ARCSS, the number of security incidents, which had already declined by about 30 percent in 2018, further decreased by about 40 percent in 2019 (ACLED, accessed February 2020).

In the first six months of 2019, 135 000 people were newly displaced as a result of conflict (IDMC, September 2019).\n\nCattle raids were a common source of tension, particularly between agropastoralist communities (ACAPS, December 2019). Intercommunal conflict in former Lakes state as well as Kapoeta East, Pibor, Twic and Yei counties, resulted in loss of lives, displacement, disruptions to livelihoods and trade routes (IPC, FEWS NET June 2019). Cattle raiding in Tonj North county in former Warrap and between communities of Rumbek East and Yirol East counties in former Lakes State also led to the loss of lives and livestock (FEWS NET, April 2019).\n\nWhile a more stable political environment allowed for improved delivery of humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable populations in 2019 (WFP, UNICEF, FAO, September 2019), movement restrictions, bureaucratic impediments and security threats to humanitarian workers persisted (ACAPS, May 2019).\n\nEconomic shocks The country is facing a protracted macroeconomic crisis. Gross Domestic Product increased in 2019 for the first time since 2014, mainly due to increased oil revenues, but the South Sudanese pound continued to depreciate on the parallel market, and by December the average exchange rate was about 315 SSP/USD, compared to about 240 SSP/USD in December 2018. The difference between the official and the parallel market exchange rates further widened, increasing from about 60 percent in December 2018 to almost 100 percent in December 2019. Inflation, already at high levels owing to insufficient food supplies, high fuel costs and a weak local currency, surged from August-October mainly as a result of trade and market disruptions caused by the widespread floods, and the year-on-year inflation rate was estimated in October 2019 at 170 percent (FAO and WFP, forthcoming).\n\nReal income declined by 70 percent between 2011 and 2019 and food prices have been soaring since 2015, leaving large segments of the population with daunting constraints in accessing food and other basic services. Limited cereal supplies and the lingering impact of conflict on trade and agricultural activities contributed to sorghum, maize and wheat prices being 45-90 percent higher in December 2019 than 2018 in Juba (FAO & WFP, 2020). Based on The Alert for Price Spikes (ALPS) indicator, 4 out of the 12 monitored markets reached crisis level in Q3 2019 (WFP, October 2019).\n\nWeather extremes Abnormally heavy seasonal rains since July caused severe flooding in large parts of the country, including areas already experiencing high levels of conflict-related vulnerability.\n\nIn late October, the Government of South Sudan declared a state of emergency in 30 counties after the flooding submerged entire communities and destroyed livelihoods or rendered them inaccessible, and cut off basic services and markets (OCHA, November 2019). By early November, an estimated 908 000 people had been affected, of whom around 420 000 were displaced (OCHA, November 2019).\n\nHumanitarian needs were very high in the east and north-east, especially in the counties of Pibor and Maban, home to over 150 000 refugees (OCHA, October 2019). According to WFP, 755 500 people were in need of food and nutrition assistance as a result of the floods (WFP, November 2019).\n\nAccording to the preliminary findings of the 2019 FAO/WFP Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission, 2019 aggregate cereal production was estimated at about 818 500 tonnes, 10 percent above the record low 2018 output and 4 percent below the average of the previous five years. Cereal production benefitted from a bigger harvested area than 2018 due to security improvements and from abundant seasonal rains, but the widespread floods resulted in significant crop losses, especially in former Jonglei, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Unity, Upper Nile and Warrap states (FAO-GIEWS, March 2020).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW The national prevalence of GAM increased from 13.3 percent in 2018 to 16.2 percent in 2019, which is considered 'very high' (FSNMS, July 2019).\n\nBased on IPC acute malnutrition protocols, 58 counties had a GAM of 10 percent and above. Some 43 counties were classified as Critical (GAM of 15.0-29.9 percent, IPC Phase 4) and 14 counties as Serious (GAM of 10.0-14.9 percent, IPC Phase 3). Most counties in Unity, Upper Nile, Jonglei and Warrap and parts of Eastern Equatoria and Lakes had Critical levels (IPC Phase 4) (IPC, September 2019).\n\nThe drivers of malnutrition are mainly sub-optimal childcare and feeding practices, food insecurity, illness, poor water quality and sanitation practices. Just 6.9 percent of children aged 6-23 months received minimally adequate diets.\n\nThe prevalence of GAM in seven of the eight refugee camps in South Sudan was serious (5-9 percent), while the remaining camp faced acceptable levels (GAM <5 percent). The prevalence of stunting was 'very high' in four camps and 'high' in three camps.\n\nAnaemia among children aged 6-59 months was at severe levels (≥40 percent) in six of the camps. The prevalence of anaemia among non-pregnant women aged 15-49 years was severe (≥40 percent) in one camp and of 'medium' public health significance (20-39 percent) in four camps.\n\nSouth Sudan, IPC Acute malnutrition situation, May-August 2019\n\nSouth Sudan, IPC Acute malnutrition situation, August 2019\n\nSouth Sudan, IPC Acute malnutrition situation, September-December 2019\n\nThe remaining camps had acceptable levels (SENS, 2018). Rates of early initiation of breastfeeding (84-93 percent), exclusive breastfeeding (88-94 percent), and continuing breastfeeding at one year (94-100 percent) were encouraging. Timely introduction of solid foods was less encouraging at 66-75 percent. Around 7-32 percent of children aged 6-59 months reportedly had diarrhoea. Younger children were more likely to be acutely malnourished and anaemic (SENS, 2018).\n\nS U D A N | M A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9\n\nPopulation analysed 41.9M (98% of total population, including IDPs, returnees and refugees)\n\n5.85M IPC Phase 3 or above in June-August 2019\n\nSUDAN IPC TECHNICAL W ORKING GROUP JULY 2019\n\n11.8M IPC Phase 2 Stressed IPC Phase 3 Crisis IPC Phase 4 Emergency 4.8M 1.0M\n\n65% Rural 35% Urban Total population of country 42.8M\n\nSudan\n\nA marginal decrease in numbers of people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) can be attributed to security improvements and a bumper 2018 harvest in Greater Darfur.

The country has experienced civil unrest since December 2018 when then President Bashir's government imposed emergency austerity measures to try to stave off economic collapse. The Sudan has external debt of over USD 50 billion, estimated at 88 percent of GDP, and has limited access to debt relief.\n\nWith close to 50 percent of the population estimated to be living below the poverty line, persisting macroeconomic challenges are resulting in daunting food access constraints for large segments of the population (OCHA, January 2020).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW From June-August 2019, over 5.85 million individuals were estimated to be in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) and in need of urgent humanitarian assistance to mitigate acute food insecurity. This figure included around 1 million people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). Nearly 11.8 million people were classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) (IPC, September 2019).\n\nKey areas of concern included Halaieb, East Jebel Marra and Bileil with area classifications in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and\n\nIn the Nuba mountain region of South Kordofan, vulnerable populations in non-government controlled areas have faced severely limited access to humanitarian assistance in recent years. Ongoing conflict is continuing to cause some new population displacements to government-controlled areas.\n\nFigure 59 Number of people (millions) in IPC Phase 2 or above in 2016-2019\n\nNote: For comparability purposes, all numbers presented exclude West Darfur since it was not included in the 2019 IPC exercise.

However, this improvement was mostly offset by a sharp deterioration in the acute food insecurity situation in Khartoum state, where the number facing acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) almost doubled, indicating increasingly severe food access constraints for market-dependent urban households.\n\nEconomic shocks The economic crisis worsened in 2019 despite the efforts of the transitional government and its cooperation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in implementing reforms to foster a recovery.\n\nWith expenditure remaining high on social and military spending, and oil export earnings stagnating, the Government faced limited scope for new borrowing, so monetized the deficit by printing money (EIU, January 2020). Year-onyear inflation increased from 43.6 percent in January to 60.7 percent in November (Central Bank of Sudan, November 2019).\n\nAs a result of these macroeconomic factors, and with traders reportedly hoarding their agricultural produce, regarded as a more reliable form of savings compared to the weakening local currency, food prices reached exceptionally high levels (IPC, September 2019 and OCHA, January 2020).\n\nSome 58 percent of households were estimated to be unable to afford the local food basket (WFP, 2019). Increasing food prices were the immediate cause of demonstrations that started in December 2018 (WB, April 2019).\n\nWeather extremes The June-September rains were erratically distributed with early onset of seasonal rains in May and adequate precipitation in June benefitting planting, but prolonged dry spells in July resulted in crop wilting, requiring multiple replanting. Exceptionally abundant late season rains from August-October, benefitted crop development, but triggered floods in 15 out of 18 states (OCHA, January 2020), affecting about 420 000 people (OCHA, November 2019), increasing the prevalence of human and livestock waterborne diseases and causing substantial crop losses.\n\nSevere infestations of birds, rodents and insects (sorghum midge and locusts) further affected crop yields. Production of cereals in 2019 is estimated at about 5.9 million tons, 33 percent down from the 2018 bumper output and 14 percent below the average of the previous five years.\n\nConflict/insecurity Security forces attempted to repress the widespread protests that resulted in more than 100 people killed, and several hundred injured (OCHA, January 2020).

The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.\n\nSudan, IPC Acute food insecurity situation, June-August 2019 declared a state of emergency in several areas, restricting movement, access to markets and livelihood activities (IPC, June 2019).\n\nIn the Greater Darfur region, security improvements in 2018 allowed substantial numbers of IDPs to return home and engage in agricultural activities, pushing up millet production in this key producing area to record levels (FAO-GIEWS, March 2019) and lowering household market dependence. This lessened the impact of soaring food prices during the 2019 lean season. Incidents of fighting had also declined in South Kordofan and Blue Nile States. However, 1.9 million IDPs who could not afford the basic food basket and 1.1 million refugees and asylum seekers displaced by conflict continued to need humanitarian assistance, both in camps and within host communities. Intercommunal tensions escalated in some areas in Darfur, Abyei and Eastern Sudan, with about 12 700 people newly displaced, mainly due to conflict in areas of Jebel Marra (Darfur) (OCHA, January 2020).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW The Sudan has the fourth highest GAM rates in the world (UNICEF, 2019) with 14.1 percent of children under 5 years acutely malnourished. Eight of the country's 18 states recorded 'very high' GAM rates, peaking at 19.5 percent in North Darfur (S3M-II, 2019). Around 2.7 million children under 5 years were acutely malnourished, 522 000 severely so.\n\nIncreasing food prices, deteriorating health care, poor sanitation and water (with sources contaminated by flooding) and food insecurity aggravate persistently high levels of malnutrition (OCHA 2020). Just 24.1 percent of children receive an adequately diverse diet. One third of the population continues to practise open defecation (S3M-II 2019).\n\nThe Sudan experienced increased morbidity with disease outbreaks including cholera, chikungunya, dengue, malaria, measles and Rift Valley fever in 2019. Malaria cases were at epidemic levels in several states, with the Ministry of Health (MoH) recording over 1.7 million cases, the majority in North Darfur, double the number of 2018. There were 3 813 cases of measles as of August 2019 (OCHA, January 2020).\n\nNutrition status of refugees GAM among refugee populations was also above the 'very high' threshold in 13 of the 23 camps and was 'high' in seven camps. The prevalence of stunting was greater than the 30 percent 'very high' threshold in 10 out of 23 camps, 'high' in 2 camps, and 'medium' in 11 camps.\n\nIn more than half of the camps anaemia prevalence among children aged 6-59 months was at critical levels (≥40 percent). The prevalence of anaemia among nonpregnant women aged 15-49 years was at critical levels (≥40 percent) in four camps and acceptable in only one (SENS, 2018).\n\nS Y R I A N A R A B R E P U B L I C | M A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9\n\nSyrian Arab Republic\n\nOCHA 2019 UNHCR DEC 2019 UNHCR, M ID 2019 AND UNRW A DEC 2019\n\nPAPFAM 2009\n\nHNO 2019\n\nW HO 2016 KAP IYCF 2017 HNO 2019\n\n6.1M Syrians were internally displaced. 950 700 Syrians were newly displaced in January- September 2019, the majority from Idlib governorate.\n\nThe Syrian Arab Republic hosts 27 800 refugees and asylumseekers and around 438 000 Palestinian refugees.\n\nThere were 5.6M Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries: Turkey (3.6M), Lebanon (900 000), Jordan (655 000), Iraq (246 000) and Egypt (129 400).\n\nThere were 467 000 spontaneous Syrian IDP returnees and 96 000 refugee returnees.\n\n4An escalation of hostilities particularly in north-west Syria continued to displace people inside the country, while almost 5.6 million registered refugees remained outside the country.\n\n4Syrians' purchasing power was limited by high unemployment rates, low salaries and high competition for labour opportunities.\n\n4Food prices increased by up to 30% during the last quarter of 2019, and market supply routes continued to be affected by insecurity in some areas.\n\n4The nominal exchange rate for the Syrian pound against the USD depreciated by 18.4% between January 2019 and 2020.\n\n4Agricultural production was slowly improving, but remained well below preconflict levels for all crops but barley.\n\n4Despite the increased area for cereal cultivation and ample rains, flooding damaged agricultural land and high temperatures and strong winds led to fires that destroyed over 85 000 hectares just before the harvest.\n\n4Malnutrition is linked with poor child care and feeding practices, limited access to basic services and conflict-related shocks.\n\nPopulation analysed 18.3M (100% of total population, including displaced populations)\n\n6.6M food-insecure people in need of assistance Jan-May 2019\n\n2.6M marginally food-insecure people\n\nHRP M ONITORING REPORT 2019\n\n64% Rural 46% Urban Total population of country 18.3M\n\nOCHA 2019\n\nAcute food insecurity has persisted at similar levels, mainly related to escalated conflict in the north-west, displacements, limited livelihood opportunities and increasing prices.\n\nWeakening local currency and unemployment, combined with continuing hostilities, displacements and returns are expected to thwart any potential improvements in the food security situation.\n\nNUTRITION INDICATORS 34.9% of children under 5 years and 33.6% of women 15-49 years are anaemic.\n\n57.3% of children 6-23 months in 3 governorates meet the minimum dietary diversity requirement.\n\n24% of children under 6 months in 11 governorates are exclusively breastfed.\n\n91 800 children under 5 years are acutely malnourished, of whom 19 300 are affected by SAM.\n\n27.5% of children under 5 years are stunted.\n\nM A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9 | S Y R I A N A R A B R E P U B L I C\n\n© UNHCR/CLAIRE THOM AS SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC\n\nFACTORS DRIVING FOOD INSECURITY\n\nConflict/insecurity Despite improvements compared to earlier years of conflict, the security situation in the Syrian Arab Republic remained fragile. There was an increase in hostilities from February 2019 onwards in parts of southern Idleb, northern Hama and western Aleppo (OCHA, October 2019). Attacks in the north-west caused some 400 000 new internal displacements from May-August before the security situation further escalated in December, with around 284 000 people, mainly from southern Idlib, leaving their homes to head north (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nIn the north-east, since Turkey announced the start of military operations on 9 October (OCHA, October 2019) clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Syrian Arab Army and Turkishbacked forces led to the displacement of over 75 400 people and disruption of water services (OCHA, November 2019). Between mid-October and December 2019, 19 000 Syrians crossed the border to Iraq (IOM, January 2020).\n\nIn the south-east, increased hostilities since November 2018 stressed IDP camps to capacity. Many, particularly young children, did not survive the harsh journey to camps (OCHA, February 2019). By March, the population of Al Hol camp exceeded 62 000 - over 90 percent women and children (OCHA, March 2019).\n\nBACKGROUND The Syrian Arab Republic has entered its ninth year of conflict (OCHA, October 2019). The conflict has caused almost 225 000 civilian deaths since 2011 (SNHR, 2020), and resulted in millions of people being internally displaced and millions seeking refuge in other countries (ACAPS, December 2019). By the end of 2019, almost 5.6 million Syrian refugees were hosted in countries in the region, chiefly in Turkey followed by Lebanon and Jordan, and a smaller number in Iraq and Egypt (UNHCR, December 2019).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW The Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) Monitoring Report 2019 estimates that 6.6 million Syrians are food insecure and need food and livelihood assistance. This marks a 2 percent increase compared to the previous year. Similarly, the number of people at risk of food insecurity has increased by 4 percent to 2.6 million people (OCHA, October 2019).\n\nThe increase in numbers of food insecure is related to large displacements following an escalation of hostilities in northwest Syria and increasing returns and displacements across the country. Of particular concern were the north-eastern, northwestern and western governorates where they were large-scale displacements (OCHA, October 2019).\n\nIn 2016, these four children fled to Lebanon with their mother when armed groups overran their hometown of Souran, north of Hama in west-central Syria. Having struggled to making a living there they have come back to reclaim their former home, now reduced to rubble, in a town ravaged by conflict.\n\nSource: OCHA, October 2019.\n\nSyrian Arab Republic, distribution of people in need of food security and agriculture assistance, 2019\n\n1-16 000\n\n225 001-360 000\n\n16 001-50 000\n\n100 001-225 000\n\n360 001-3 500 000\n\nIn southern Syria, insecurity increased in the first few months of 2019, particularly in Dara'a governorate, where violence resulted in deaths, looting and other security incidents, displacing unknown numbers of people. Access to basic services, including health facilities, electricity and WASH, was difficult. The agricultural sector was highly affected (OCHA, August 2019).\n\nMass displacement of rural Syrians has had a particularly negative impact on the agricultural industry with equipment losses and damages to irrigation, roads and energy infrastructure, which is particularly troubling since the sector contributes to a substantial share of the country's GDP (FAO, 2019).\n\nRegardless of insecurity, almost 91 000 former refugees returned home during 2019, an increase of 60 percent compared to 2018 (3RP, January 2020).\n\nEconomic shocks Around 80 percent of Syrians depend on markets for food (CFSAM, September 2019). The relative improvements in security opened up some important trade routes that had been unusable since 2013. However, the economy remains troubled and around 70 percent of Syrians mentioned unemployment as their main problem (WFP, 2019).\n\nPost-harvest losses, increased fuel prices and the depreciated Syrian pound (down by 18.4 percent against the USD between January 2019 and 2020 (WFP, January 2020) led to higher food prices across all 14 governorates (CFSAM, September 2019).\n\nBy November, the reference food basket price had increased by 11 percent compared to the previous month and by 21 percent compared to November 2018. The increase was highest in AlHasakeh governorate at 51 percent (WFP, November 2019).\n\nEven though more land was cultivated than in 2018, wheat harvested areas were still 25 percent below the pre-crisis average. Farmers continued to face challenges with high production and transportation costs, as well as limited quality inputs. Fruit and vegetable production was challenged by low purchasing power of consumers, the inability to export produce and shortage of domestic processing (FAO-GIEWS, September 2019).\n\nFor the 2018/19 season, agricultural prospects were positive as a result of favourable weather conditions and displaced farming households returning home. Wheat and barley planted areas increased by 23 percent in one year and 93 percent of the planted areas were harvested, compared to 59 percent the previous year. Barley production exceeded pre-crisis levels, but wheat production was still far below and import requirements were almost 1.8 million tonnes (CFSAM, September 2019).\n\nWeather extremes Hasakeh governorate faced the worst flooding in a decade following heavy rains in March, affecting around 118 000 people, including IDPs (IFRC, April 2019). The rains increased yields, but high temperatures and strong winds caused fires on standing crops before the May/June harvest (CFSAM, September 2019).\n\nPeople in need\n\nThe designations employed and the presentation of material on this map do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the Secretariat of the United Nations concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW Acute malnutrition among children was within acceptable levels, affecting around 91 800 children. Another 865 300 were expected to have micronutrient deficiencies. Chronic malnutrition was a concern, even before the crisis (HNO, March 2019). Stunting among children aged 0-59 months was above 30 percent in Eastern Ghouta and Tel Abyed, based on SMART surveys conducted during 2019 (NC, August 2019).\n\nIn 2017, fewer than a third (31.9 percent) of children aged 6-23 months in Aleppo, Idlib and Hama governorates received a minimum acceptable diet (NC, April 2017).\n\nInfant feeding was also concerning with only 24 percent of children under 6 months exclusively breastfed in 11 governorates in 2018 (HNO, March 2019) while nutrition surveillance data from 2019 suggests that in pockets, such as in north-western areas, exclusive breastfeeding was provided to only 10 percent of babies (NC, August 2019).\n\nSYRIAN REFUGEES IN THE REGION While almost 5.6 million Syrians are registered as refugees in the region the figure is estimated at 7.3 million when non-registered refugees are included (3RP, January 2020). While Turkey hosts the highest number, Lebanon and Jordan have more Syrian refugees per capita, at over 13 percent of the population in Lebanon and 6 percent in Jordan. When including the estimated numbers of unregistered refugees, the proportion rises to 22 percent in Lebanon and 13 percent in Jordan1 (UNHCR, March 2019).\n\nFood insecurity among Syrian refugees in Turkey worsened slightly compared to 2018, with around 23 percent classified as food insecure - a slight rise from above 18 percent in 2018. Adoption of consumption-based coping strategies to bridge food access gaps increased (WFP, September 2019).2\n\nConversely, in Lebanon, refugee household level food consumption continued to improve for a third consecutive year with 29 percent considered food insecure compared with 34 percent in 2018. The worst areas were North and Mount Lebanon governorates. However, more households were resorting to crisis livelihood-related coping strategies to cope with a lack of food and/or the means to buy it, such as reducing expenditure on health, education and selling productive assets (VASyr, December 2019).\n\nComparison of country population in 2019 (UN DESA) against refugee numbers 2 WFP. 2019. Emergency Social Safety Net Post Distribution Monitoring Summary, Round 8 (Cross- 1\n\nSection 4). September 2019.\n\nWFP programme monitoring indicates that in Egypt, during the first half of 2019, 70-90 percent of refugees had acceptable food consumption. Around 30-50 percent of households reduced the number of daily meals and/or meal sizes (WFP M&E, 2019). WFP monitoring in Iraq indicates that around 90 percent of Syrian refugee households had acceptable food consumption and 10-15 percent were reducing the number of daily meals or meal sizes (WFP M&E, 2019). In Jordan, an overall trend of increased consumption of nutritious foods was observed among Syrian refugee households during the first quarter of 2019. Around 20-30 percent of non-camp refugee households reduced the number of daily meals and meal sizes (WFP M&E, 2019).3\n\nEconomic shocks Lebanon is experiencing a macroeconomic crisis marked by very high levels of public debt. The cost of living has ballooned, salaries have stagnated and unemployment rates have risen, prompting a significant proportion of the country's well-educated youth to emigrate. A planned tax on free phone calls over social media applications, announced in October along with other austerity measures, prompted mass demonstrations bringing most of the country to a standstill (ICG, October 2019).\n\nCereal prices increased by around 10-30 percent between October and December 2019 (WFP, January 2020). The proportion of Syrian refugees living below the poverty line increased from 68 percent in 2018 to 73 percent in 2019. More than half live in extreme poverty. Around 66 percent of men and just 11 percent of women had a regular job, but the two main sources of income were WFP assistance (24 percent), and informal debt from friends and shops (22 percent). Nine out of 10 households were in debt with the average level per household increasing by USD 100 from 2018 to USD 1 115 in 2019. The main reason for borrowing was to buy food (75 percent) (VASyr, December 2019).\n\nTriggered by a sharp depreciation of the Turkish Lira and a fall in investor confidence and domestic demand, by the end of 2018 Turkey had entered a recession, with inflation running at 20 percent (WB, April 2019). However, by August 2019, its headline inflation rate had dropped to its lowest level since May 2018 (TSI, August 2019). Both assisted and non-assisted Syrian refugees accumulated higher levels of debt than during 2017-2018. Around two-thirds of refugee families were borrowing money from non-relatives and buying food on credit (WFP, September 2019). Nearly half (46 percent) or 1.6 million Syrian refugees in Turkey were living in poverty and 10 percent or 215 000 were living in extreme poverty (WFP, May 2019).\n\nWFP. 2019.

Refugee populations in Uganda rely heavily on food assistance to meet their needs. According to WFP, approximately 62 percent of refugees experienced borderline or poor food consumption scores in May 2019, up from 28 percent at the same time in 2018 (WFP, May 2019).\n\nDuring an atypically severe 2019 lean season (FEWS NET, December 2018), many households in Karamoja were consuming one meal per day, instead of a typical three (FEWS NET, June 2019), and in May 2019, 85 percent of households in the region had poor and borderline food consumption scores (WFP, May 2019).\n\nConflict/insecurity In 2019, persistent armed conflict, inter-ethnic violence and limited access to basic social services drove over 190 000 additional refugees and asylum seekers to seek refuge in Uganda, mainly from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Burundi, increasing the overall refugee population to 1.38 million by the end of December 2019 (UNHCR, accessed January 2020). Though Uganda has one of the most progressive refugee management policies in\n\nBACKGROUND In 2019, Uganda hosted the third largest number of refugees globally, and the highest number in the Greater Horn of Africa (UNHCR, accessed January 2020). Agriculture provides 70 percent of employment and 25 percent of GDP (WB, November 2018). With favourable year-round climatic conditions, it is self-sufficient in staple food production and plays a major role in regional food supply, though most production takes place at the smallholder level, under rainfed conditions. Many of the northern districts are prone to drought and rely on supplies from surplus-producing areas (FEWS NET, January 2017). Around 8 million Ugandans (21.4 percent of the population) live in poverty (Uganda Bureau of Statistics, 2019).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW FEWS NET estimates that 1.5 million people were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) in April-July in the absence of food assistance. Most of them were refugees and asylum seekers, as well as poor households in Karamoja affected by a poor 2018 rainy season severely constraining crop and livestock production. Acute food insecurity deteriorated since the early part of the year in the Eastern region and parts of Northern and Central regions, resulting in Stressed\n\nClashes in north-eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo forced thousands into Uganda in 2019, fleeing extreme brutality. Nearly two in three were children. the world (WB, 2016 and Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung, 2017), refugees in the settlements experience a number of obstacles that hinder their efforts to attain self-reliance and food security (FSNA, 2018). For example, despite WFP reaching approximately 85 percent of refugees with food or cash assistance, their typical monthly food ration sometimes only lasts 13-23 days, leaving a 7-18 days food gap (FSNA, 2018).\n\nAdditionally, refugee households assessed by UNHCR reported a reliance on a variety of negative consumption and livelihood-based coping strategies (e.g. reliance on less preferred or less expensive food, reduced number of meals consumed per day, reduced portion size, reduced consumption among adults to prioritize children, borrowing and begging). On a more positive note, however, a very low proportion of households across the settlements reported engaging in potentially risky or harmful coping strategies (SENS, 2017).\n\nWeather extremes In the north-eastern Karamoja region, the 2019 April- September rainy season did not fully establish until mid-May, substantially delaying planting. Torrential rains in June offset the moisture deficits, but hindered ploughing and sowing activities in some areas. Households were only able to retain limited amounts of cereal seeds from the poor 2018 harvest, which contributed to a decline in planted areas to below average levels. Average to above-average rains from\n\nJune-September 2019 benefitted yields, but unseasonal precipitations in October and November disrupted cereal harvesting, drying and storage (FAO-GIEWS, January 2020). The harvest of sorghum, the main cereal grown in the area, was concluded in several areas in December with about two months of delay and production was estimated by FEWS NET at 20-30 percent below average. Late harvests, as well as a scarcity of seasonal income-generating opportunities, caused the lean season to be prolonged and more severe than usual, worsening food insecurity (FEWS NET, October 2019).\n\nIn bi-modal rainfall areas covering most of the country, the first half of the March-June rainy season was characterized by exceptional dryness, among the worst on record since 1982. The drought conditions, with cumulative rains between early March and the second dekad of April estimated at up to 80 percent below average, delayed planting and resulted in widespread germination failures and crop wilting.\n\nImproved rains in late April allowed replanting of failed crops, but the planted area was below average as several farmers did not have enough seeds for replanting or opted to not plant as the rainy season was already too advanced. Above-average rains in May and June benefitted the establishment and development of late-planted and re-planted crops and allowed a partial crop recovery (FAO-GIEWS, August 2019).\n\nThe output of the first season harvest was 10-15  percent below average, according to FEWS NET.

However, the torrential rains triggered flooding and landslides in eastern Mount Elgon subregion and in south-western Bundibugyo, Kalungu, Kisoro and Ntoroko districts, affecting about 300 000 people and causing localized crop losses and damage to infrastructure (FAO-GIEWS, January 2020).\n\nEconomic shocks High and volatile food prices during 2019 severely constrained food access for poor households. According to FAO-GIEWS, prices of maize started to increase from early 2019 in several markets including the capital Kampala, with seasonal patterns compounded by an earlier-than-usual depletion of stocks from the below-average 2018 second harvest.\n\nPrices accelerated sharply due to concerns over the impact of early season dryness on the performance of the 2019 first season harvest, surging by almost 50 percent between March- June.\n\nAfter having declined by about 30 percent from June- September as the first season harvest increased market availabilities, maize prices surged again by up to 50 percent from September-December, with seasonal patterns compounded by increased transport costs and trade disruptions caused by torrential rains. December prices were at very high levels, up to twice their year-earlier values, mainly due to a tight domestic supply situation following the below-average first season harvest coupled with sustained export demand from Kenya and South Sudan (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019).\n\nIn the Karamoja region, according to WFP's mVAM, prices of beans, maize grain and sorghum slightly began to decline in September with the start of the 2019 harvest, but remained 38-71 percent above the 2018 average levels due to an early depletion of stocks of the poor 2018 harvest and unfavourable prospects for 2019 crops (WFP, September 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW National prevalence of stunting among children under 5 years slightly reduced from 33 percent in 2011 to 28.9 percent in 2016 (DHS, 2016). However, the absolute number of stunted children has stagnated at about 2.1 million because of rapid population growth. A relatively low prevalence of wasting in children under 5 years (4 percent in 2016) masks significant regional inequities with Karamoja and West Nile recording particularly high wasting levels (≥10 percent) (DHS, 2016).\n\nNationally only 14.6 percent of children aged 6-23 months received a minimum acceptable diet (in the Acholi region this percentage fell to 2.8 percent), and just 30.3 percent received the minimum recommended dietary diversity (dropping to 7.3 percent in Acholi region) (DHS, 2016).\n\nFollowing national reductions in anaemia in children under 5 years and women of reproductive age between 2006 and 2011, there was an increase between 2011 and 2016. Anaemia remained a 'severe' public health issue for children under 5 years (52.8 percent) and a 'moderate' public health issue for adolescent girls and women; 72 percent of children aged 6-8 months were anaemic, indicating insufficient iron stores at birth as a result of poor maternal nutrition (DHS, 2016).\n\nNutrition status of refugees According to the 2017 food security and nutrition assessment in West Nile settlements, refugee populations in Palabek had the highest GAM prevalence at 12.3 percent (FSNA, 2018). Other settlements with concerning GAM were Adjumani (11.8 percent), Bidibidi (11.8 percent), Palorinya (11.1 percent) and Arua (10.3 percent). In South West settlements, the GAM rate was below 5 percent. The prevalence of SAM was below 1 percent in the refugee settlements (SENS, 2017).\n\nRecent improvements in food security among the refugees following the resumption of full rations since 2018, coupled with increased income opportunities in most settlements, have significantly improved nutrition outcomes of refugees. However, nutritional vulnerability remained in refugeehosting districts and in Karamoja in northern Uganda where 56 percent of refugees reportedly had poor and/or borderline food consumption (WFP, 2018 and 2019).\n\nU N I T E D R E P U B L I C O F T A N Z A N I A | M A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9\n\nPopulation analysed 4.8M (8% of total population)\n\n1M IPC Phase 3 or above in November 2019-April 2020\n\nUNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA IPC TECHNICAL W ORKING GROUP DECEM BER 2019\n\n1.7M IPC Phase 2 Stressed\n\nIPC Phase 3 Crisis IPC Phase 4 Emergency 761 000 225 000\n\n66% Rural 34% Urban\n\nTotal population of country 58M\n\nUnited Republic of Tanzania No data was available for 2018.

By the end of 2019, 285 400 refugees were settled in the country, mostly from Burundi (73 percent) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (27 percent) (UNHCR, December 2019). Close to 85 percent of them lived in camps - mainly in the Nyarugusu, Nduta and Mtendeli camps located in the Kigoma region - while over 8 percent were living among host communities in villages and urban areas, and 6 percent in informal settlements.\n\nWhile the latest arrivals occurred in 2018, around 79 000 Burundian refugees and over 8 000 Congolese refugees returned to their home country between 2017 and 2019. In 2019, 20 900 Burundian refugees were assisted to voluntarily return up until November (UNHCR, November 2019). Refugees in the four camps mostly rely on in-kind food assistance from WFP. They can buy food and basic items from\n\nBACKGROUND The United Republic of Tanzania is generally a food-secure and self-sufficient crop producer, and one of the largest maize exporters of the sub-region (WFP, July 2019). However, weather shocks, such as drought and floods, frequently affect the country by disrupting livelihoods and damaging infrastructure (Erman et al, 2019).\n\nSuch shocks have particularly severe consequences for almost half (49 percent) of the population who are under the international poverty line and are less able to cope and recover (2011) (WB, accessed January 2020). Agriculture is central to the economy and local livelihoods, as it represents 30 percent of GDP, supports about 80 percent of livelihoods in rural areas and meets 95 percent of the national food needs, but is characterized by limited use of modern farming techniques, including irrigation (FAO, 2019).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW During the 2019/2020 lean season from November 2019-April 2020, around one million people were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above), representing over 20 percent of the population surveyed across 16 districts. The figure included 225 000 in Emergency (IPC Phase 4).

They can also go to the community markets for a wider selection of items (SENS, 2019).\n\nMore than 80 percent of refugee households had acceptable food consumption in 2019, climbing from 81 percent in March to 84 percent in June and 86 percent in August. However, over the same time period, refugees increasingly resorted to consumption-based strategies to cover their food needs. The proportion reducing the number of daily meals increased from 40 percent to 61 percent (WFP, November 2019).\n\nWeather extremes and crop pests The 2019 Msimu harvest, completed in June in western, central and southern unimodal rainfall areas, was estimated to be above average thanks to adequate and well-distributed rainfall. However, in northern, north-eastern and coastal bimodal rainfall areas, the Masika main season harvest in August was well below average, due to erratic rains in the March-May long rainy season and fall armyworm outbreaks, which were estimated at more than 50 percent in Manyara, Geita, Kagera, Simiyu and Kilimanjaro regions (FAO-GIEWS). A needs assessment carried out by FAO in Iringa, Manyara and Morogoro - which account for 11 percent of the national maize production - found that in the three regions 64 percent of farmers suffered yield losses due to the pest and that on average they lost 11 percent of the total maize crop (Turot et al, forthcoming).\n\nThe 2019 aggregate cereal production was estimated at about 10 million tonnes, 3 percent down from the output obtained in 2018 and the average of the previous five years (FAO-GIEWS).\n\nExceptionally abundant rains during the October-December 2019 short rainy season boosted crop yields, but also triggered flooding, causing localized crop losses and damage to infrastructure. Mara was one of the most affected regions at the end of October with homes and infrastructure, including roads and bridges, either destroyed or damaged. Some 370 acres of crop farms were washed away (IFRC, November 2019).\n\nEconomic shocks As a result of poor weather conditions and lower agricultural production, reduced labour opportunities in farming and above-average staple prices contributed to reducing households' purchasing power in 2019. Prices of maize followed a sustained, albeit irregular, increasing trend throughout 2019, as a result of sustained exports to Kenya, Rwanda and particularly Zimbabwe as well as the reduced Masika harvest and the heavy rains that disrupted trade flows and inflated transport costs (FAO-GIEWS).\n\nAt the national level wholesale rice prices started increasing in August and by November they were around 20 percent above year-earlier levels. Maize prices were increasing since April and by December they were almost double year-earlier levels (WFP, November 2019). In November wholesale beans prices were 33 percent higher than in November 2018 (FEWS NET, December 2019). As a result, vulnerable households had to resort to negative coping strategies such as begging and selling productive assets (IPC, February 2020).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW The acute malnutrition rate among children aged 6-59 months was 'low' at 4.5 percent, reaching 'medium' levels of 9 percent in Kusini Pemba and 8.7 percent in Kaskazini Pemba regions. Stunting at the national level was 'very high' at 34.4 percent (DHS 2015-2016), affecting around 3.6 million1 children.\n\nAmong the main drivers of these extremely concerning rates of chronic malnutrition were child feeding practices: only 8.7 percent of children aged 6-23 months consumed a minimum acceptable diet and 59.2 percent of infants were exclusively breastfed (DHS 2015-16).\n\nCountry population*18% of population under 5*34.4% 1\n\nIn 2018 around 142 000 people were affected by tuberculosis (WHO, accessed January 2020) and 1.6 million people were living with HIV with 4.6 percent of the adult population affected (UNAIDS, accessed January 2020). HIV/AIDS was the third most common reported cause of death (CDC, May 2019). The country faced the continued risk of importing Ebola virus disease from the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo with the alert of a suspected case in September 2019 (UNICEF, 2019).\n\nNutrition status of refugees The overall acute malnutrition status in refugees in the United Republic of Tanzania is acceptable. The latest SENS nutrition survey in 2019 reported that the GAM prevalence in the four major camps was under 5 percent and the SAM rate was below 0.2 percent. However, the chronic malnutrition status was over the 'very high' threshold in all camps (30 percent).\n\nRefugees living in camps have access to health facilities within the camps. No major disease outbreaks occurred in 2019, but the malaria prevalence is generally high in the region, and the diarrhoea incidence in children under 5 is concerning (22.7-27.0 percent). All refugee households accessed water from an improved source (SENS, 2019).\n\nV E N E Z U E L A ( B O L I V A R I A N R E P U B L I C O F ) | M A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9\n\nW FP EM ERGENCY FOOD SECURITY ASSESSM ENT Total population of country 28.5M\n\nAcute food insecurity levels rose as the Venezuelans remaining in the country felt the acute impact of hyperinflation and were unable to meet their essential needs.\n\nEconomic hardship is expected to intensify for the Venezuelans left in the country, as well as for the increasing numbers migrating to Colombia and Ecuador.\n\nR4V, DECEM BER 2019\n\nUNICEF 2019\n\nJM E 2009\n\nPopulation analysed 28.5M (100% of total population)\n\nModerately food-insecure people\n\nMarginally food-insecure people\n\nSeverely food-insecure people 7M 2.3M\n\nAcutely food-insecure people in need of assistance in July-September 2019\n\nThere were around 3.8M Venezuelan refugees and migrants in Latin America and the Caribbean including: 1.6M in Colombia, 862 000 in Peru and 385 000 in Ecuador.\n\nDriven out by food shortages, high prices, lack of work and insecurity, the number of Venezuelans emigrating rose from 3 million to 4.6 million between 2018 and 2019.\n\n4Deep economic recession has persisted for five consecutive years with monthly inflation reaching 200% in January 2019.\n\n4More than a third of the population have experienced total loss of income.\n\n4The minimum monthly wage (USD 7) covered less than 5% of the basic food basket.\n\n4Food shortages became more prevalent as the harvest was below average and dwindling foreign exchange earnings limited imports.\n\n4The disintegration of health services and mass exodus of health workers disproportionately affected the most vulnerable, and threatened their nutrition status.\n\nNUTRITION INDICATORS 6.3% of children under 5 years are acutely malnourished.\n\n13.4% of children under 5 years are stunted.\n\nDISPLACEMENT\n\n12% Rural 88% Urban W\n\nB 2018\n\n30% of children under 5 years and 23.9% of women 15-49 years are anaemic.\n\n96% of households have access to at least basic drinking water services.\n\nM A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9 | V E N E Z U E L A ( B O L I V A R I A N R E P U B L I C O F )\n\nW FP/DEIVID TORRADO\n\nVENEZUELA (BOLIVARIAN REPUBLIC OF)\n\n7 million were moderately food insecure (WFP, February 2020). The majority of Venezuelans (60 percent) were marginally food secure, meaning they had acceptable food consumption by engaging in irreversible coping strategies and were unable to afford some essential non-food expenditures. These households were in danger of becoming food insecure if they faced any additional shocks.\n\nThe analysis shows that acute food insecurity is countrywide. Even in the states with the lowest rates of acute food insecurity, including Lara, Cojedes and Merida, approximately one in five people were estimated to be moderately food insecure. Eleven states had rates of severe food insecurity that were higher than the national prevalence, peaking at 21 percent in Delta Amacuro, followed by Amazonas (15 percent), Falcón (13 percent), Zulia and Bolívar (both 11 percent).\n\nEconomic shocks The year 2019 marked the fifth consecutive year of deep economic recession. GDP per capita (valued in USD) declined by 76 percent between 2015 and 2020 (IMF, January 2020). Food prices soared, and inflation peaked in January 2019 at\n\nBACKGROUND Despite possessing the world's largest oil reserves, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is currently one of the world's most concerning acute food insecurity hotspots. The catalyst for the crisis was the sharp decline in global oil prices from 2013, prompting national oil production to almost half and the economy to contract by 45 percent between 2013 and 2018, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The loss of income-earning opportunities, hyperinflation and general collapse of the country's public infrastructure and services, have made daily life a struggle for survival for most Venezuelans (Wilson Centre, September 2019).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW Around 9.3 million Venezuelans - a third (32 percent) of the total population - were food insecure and in need of assistance according to WFP's Emergency Food Security Assessment carried out in July-September 2019.1 Of these, 2.3 million were considered severely food insecure and\n\nAt the end of the assessment 8 375 valid questionnaires were collected, ensuring statistical representation at state level. The prevalence of acute food insecurity was obtained by analysing food consumption patterns, food and livelihood coping strategies and economic vulnerability. For more information on the FCS and the CARI approach please see chapter 1. The Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela does not endorse the results of this survey. 1\n\nSince the start of the socioeconomic crisis, nearly 5 million Venezuelans have been driven out of their country as refugees and migrants, making it the second largest refugee crisis in the world. The majority are families with children, pregnant women, elderly people and people with disabilities.\n\nSource: WFP, February 2020. The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.\n\nVenezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), prevalence of severe food insecurity by state, 2019 over 200 percent per month. Although the pace of inflation decelerated to 33 percent in December after the government allowed transactions in US dollars, Venezuelans' purchasing power to buy food eroded by more than 8 000 percent in 2019 (Banco Central de Venezuela, 2019).\n\nIn April 2019, the minimum wage was estimated at USD 7 per month and only covered 4.7 percent of the basic food basket (OHCHR, July 2019). An assessment concluded in December 2019 found that an average family required 55 minimum daily wages to cover the cost of a monthly basic food basket (CENDA, December 2019). The impact of the economic crisis has been magnified by the collapse of the country's public infrastructure and services (IMC, February 2020).\n\nMore than a third of respondents in WFP's 2019 EFSA (37 percent) said they had experienced a total loss of income, such as losing their only job or losing their business and half (51 percent) had suffered a partial loss, such as reduced salaries or the loss of one of two jobs. Results showed that 18 percent of households relied on government assistance and social protection systems (WFP, February 2020).\n\nThe 2019 maize harvest was expected to be below average following a significant reduction in the planted area because of high costs of and a general lack of agricultural inputs, reflecting the significant depreciation of the currency and import difficulties (OCHA, November 2019). Consequently, reliance on imported food increased, but with dwindling foreign exchange earnings,2 food shortages became increasingly pressing.\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW The Venezuelan Government has not published nutrition data since 2007. UNICEF collected nutrition status data from 100 000 children under 5 years and pregnant and lactating women in 16 states in 2019. It found 6.3 percent of children within this group were wasted, considered a 'medium' GAM prevalence (UNICEF, December 2019).\n\nIn 2019, four major national blackouts left the majority of the country without electricity for several days. The power disruptions, coupled with medicine and equipment shortages, and mass exodus of healthcare workers and specialists, have pushed the healthcare system to the brink of collapse. Hospital patients - many of whom are already critically ill- have a higher risk of acquiring new infections while in the hospital, due to a lack of basic cleaning supplies. The disintegration of services disproportionately affects the most vulnerable, including indigenous populations, children under the age of 5 years, pregnant and lactating women, adolescents, those with chronic and non-communicable diseases, and the elderly (IMC, December 2019).\n\nThe decline foreign exchange earnings was mainly caused by the drop in oil production as the management of the state oil company went into disarray. Economic sanctions imposed on Venezuela further limited export earnings and access to external finance. 2\n\n< 6.6%\n\nPrevalence of severe food insecurity > 10.9%\n\n6.6%-10.8%\n\nVENEZUELAN MIGRANTS IN THE REGION The Venezuelan crisis has sparked the biggest mass migration movement in the region, and globally it is second after the Syrian refugee crisis. Food shortages, high food prices, lack of work, insecurity and violence have driven an estimated 4.8 million or 15 percent of the total population of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to abandon their homes and livelihoods and migrate since the outbreak of the crisis (R4V, February 2020). Most have remained in Latin America and the Caribbean (3.9 million), with over 40 percent or 1.6 million Venezuelans in Colombia (R4V, December 2019).\n\nIn Colombia, approximately 891 000 (55 percent of the analysed migrant population), were severely or moderately food insecure and in need of food assistance in 2019. Of them around 345 000 (21 percent) were severely food insecure and 546 000 were moderately food insecure (34 percent). An estimated 673 000 were marginally food secure (EFSA, November 2019).\n\nIn Ecuador, approximately 292 600 Venezuelan migrants (76 percent of the analysed population) were severely or moderately food insecure and in need of food assistance in 2019. Of them 100 000 (26 percent) were severely food insecure and 192 500 were moderately food insecure (50 percent). An estimated 92 000 were marginally food secure (EFSA, March 2019).\n\nFACTORS DRIVING FOOD INSECURITY While Colombia has increased migrants' access to employment since 2018 (RMRP 2020), for most their main source of income was irregular daily wage labour (59 percent), making them highly vulnerable to any potential shocks. As many as 75 percent of Venezuelan migrants in Colombia were living below the poverty line. Most of their expenses were spent on food (42 percent) and shelter (23 percent). One in three were in debt, primarily to buy food. Living conditions provide an indicator of economic vulnerability. One in three migrants in Colombia lived in unacceptable accommodation, informal shelters or on the street and nearly half (45 percent) lived in crowded conditions. Most had to use emergency coping strategies, such as begging, to meet their basic food needs. (EFSA, November 2019).\n\nIn Ecuador, 37 percent of Venezuelan migrants were living in poverty. Around 29 percent were living in critically crowded conditions, and 41 percent were homeless (EFSA, March 2019). Visa restrictions placed on Venezuelans entering Ecuador in 2019 have affected their ability to generate an income. More than half (55 percent) were not able to earn enough money to cover their basic needs (RMRP, 2020).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW There is a lack of nutrition data on refugees and migrants from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. But malnutrition and food insecurity are of particular concern in rural and remote areas (RMRP 2020). Most Venezuelan migrants in Colombia were highly reliant on key food staples, which were consumed more frequently than more nutritious and diversified food groups (dairy, vegetables and fruit) (EFSA, November 2019).\n\nAccess to safe water and solid waste management is challenging in several areas both for hosts and migrants, particularly when essential infrastructure is lacking or overwhelmed (RMRP 2020). Four in 10 migrants did not have access to safe drinking water in their accommodation (EFSA, November 2019).\n\nAlthough Colombia has increased health care coverage for Venezuelan migrants since 2018 (RMRP 2020) 58 percent of migrants assessed did not have access to medical services, and 28 percent of migrant children were in need of basic vaccinations (EFSA, November 2019).\n\nAn estimated 27 000 Venezuelan migrants in Ecuador were in need of nutrition support in 2019. Almost half (45 percent) of Venezuelan children suffer from anaemia, one in five (20 percent) from chronic malnutrition and 2 percent from acute malnutrition (RMRP 2020). One in three children under 2 years old were not breastfed. Around 40 percent of pregnant or breastfeeding Venezuelan migrant woman did not receive prenatal care.\n\nY E M E N | M A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9\n\nUNHCR OCT 2019\n\nUNHCR AUG 2019/ IOM 2019\n\nW HO 2016 DHS 2013 HNO 2019\n\nPopulation analysed 29.9M (100% of total population including displaced populations)\n\n15.9M IPC Phase 3 or above in December 2018-January 2019\n\nYEM EN IPC TECHNICAL W ORKING GROUP DECEM BER 2018\n\n8.9M IPC Phase 2 Stressed IPC Phase 3 Crisis IPC Phase 4 Emergency IPC Phase 5 Catastrophe 10.9M 5M 64 000\n\n63% Rural 27% Urban Total population of country 29.9M\n\nCSO-UN 2018\n\nDespite massive humanitarian assistance, acute food insecurity remained alarmingly high due to persistent conflict, economic decline and disrupted livelihoods, affecting over half of the population.\n\nThe combined effects of conflict, macroeconomic crisis, climate-related shocks and crop pests, including fall armyworm and desert locusts, are likely to lead to increasing levels of acute food insecurity in 2020.\n\nOver 3.6M Yemenis were internally displaced. 390 500 people were displaced at least once in 2019.\n\nThere were around 277 300 refugees and asylum seekers, mainly from Somalia followed by Ethiopia.\n\nThere were around 1.3M IDP returnees and 44 800 Yemeni returnees from Saudi Arabia.\n\n4Insecurity continued to deny people access to livelihoods, markets and other basic services.\n\n4Lack of foreign currency kept exchange rates high and informal rates even higher, disrupting essential imports and payment of public sector salaries.\n\n4Food prices in the third quarter of 2019 were well above the five-year average - rice by 83% and wheat by 50%.\n\n4Acute fuel shortages increased prices from mid-September.\n\n4Over 40% of Yemeni households have lost their primary income source and labour opportunities are scarce.\n\n4Total cereal production in 2019 was forecast at about 12% below the previous year.\n\n4Conflict and economic collapse have exacerbated poor health care and inadequate child care and feeding practices.\n\nNUTRITION INDICATORS 83.5% of children under 5 years and 69.6% of women 15-49 years are anaemic.\n\n63% of households have access to at least basic drinking water services.\n\n26.6% of children 6-23 months meet the minimum dietary diversity requirement.\n\n10% of children under 6 months are exclusively breastfed.\n\n2M children under 5 years are acutely malnourished, of whom 0.4M are affected by SAM.\n\nM A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9 | Y E M E N\n\n© W FP/M OHAM M ED AW ADH\n\nYEMEN A hotspot IPC analysis conducted in 29 worst-offdistricts in 12 governorates in July1 found the number in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) in these areas fell from 1.55 million in January 2019, when 44 000 were classified in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5), to 1.25 million, with no populations in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5), thanks to increased humanitarian assistance and seasonal food production (IPC, July 2019).\n\nBased on FEWS NET, Famine (IPC Phase 5) risk persists, particularly if conflict disrupts port operations for a prolonged period of time, significantly limiting food imports and trade to markets inland (FEWS NET, December 2019). Emergency (IPC Phase  4) outcomes were expected in Hajjah and Sa'adah while Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes were widespread.\n\nConflict/insecurity In April 2019, the United Nations Security Council members expressed grave concern that the 2018 Stockholm peace agreement had not been implemented and that the humanitarian situation was deteriorating. The escalation in violence in Hajjah and on the Yemeni-Saudi border risked undermining the ceasefire in Hodeidah (UNSC, April 2019).\n\nLogistical challenges prevented the analysis from being carried out in another 16 districts. 1\n\nBACKGROUND In 2019, Yemen was still the worst humanitarian crisis in the world (United Nations, February 2019). The escalation of the decade-long conflict between the government and Houthi movement since 2015 exacerbated chronic poverty, weak governance, corruption, over-dependence on imports, dwindling oil revenues and water scarcity (ACAPS, December 2019). Poverty affects over 70 percent of Yemenis (WB, October 2019). A United Nations-brokered ceasefire in December 2018 reduced violence in Hodeidah, but fighting continued in 2019 on numerous active frontlines (ACAPS, December 2019).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW An estimated 15.9 million people or over half (53 percent) of the country's population were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) from December 2018-January 2019, despite ongoing humanitarian food assistance. Of these, about 5 million faced Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and 64 000 Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5).\n\nThe districts with active fighting (Hodeidah, Hajjah, Saadah, Taiz, Al Dhale, Al Baidhaa and Aljawf) were the worst off, while IDPs, host families, marginalized groups and landless wage labourers were the most vulnerable groups (IPC, December 2018).\n\nAmina fled Hodeidah governorate with her parents and six siblings for a makeshift camp in Aden after mortars hit their neighbourhood.\n\nIn 2019, the conflict continued to disrupt economic activity and hydrocarbon exports, damage infrastructure and destroy basic public services (WB, October 2019). It continued to restrict people's access to markets and services, particularly in Aden, Hodeidah, Ad Dhali' and Hajjah (ACAPS, October 2019). September was one of the worst months for civilian casualties with an average of 13 killed or injured daily (OCHA, November 2019).\n\nSome 3.6 million people are internally displaced, with over 390 000 displaced during 2019 (IOM, 2019).\n\nHumanitarian access continued to be very challenging. Over 6 million people live in 75 hard-to-reach districts, with bureaucracy and conflict the main impediments to meeting their humanitarian needs (ACAPS, October 2019). JuneJuly saw the highest number of violent incidents against humanitarian workers and assets, particularly in northern areas (OCHA, November 2019) and WFP suspended food distribution in Sana'a for over a month due to Houthi restrictions on beneficiary selection and monitoring (ACAPS, October 2019).\n\nEconomic shocks The acute shortages of foreign exchange and fall in government revenues have interrupted the purchase of essential imports and payment of public sector salaries and pensions (WB, October 2019).\n\nAn estimated 40 percent of Yemeni households have lost their primary source of income and find it difficult to buy the minimum amount of food (WB, October 2019). Limited employment and depressed wages and salaries further increased reliance on humanitarian assistance (IPC, July 2019). Food prices in the third quarter were well above the five-year average - rice by 83 percent and wheat by 50 percent (WFP, October 2019). Sorghum, millet and maize prices were 140-170 percent higher than pre-crisis levels (FAO and FSTS, October 2019).\n\nFuel and gas shortages disrupted electricity, water, sanitation and health services and raised the cost of basic goods. In October, black market fuel prices were nearly three times higher than the official price (NRC, October 2019). Petrol prices were around 22 percent higher in the third quarter of 2019 compared with the same period in 2018 (WFP, October 2019).\n\nWeather extremes and crop pests In June, rains and flash flooding affected close to 70 000 people, including IDPs, in over 10 governorates (OCHA, June 2019). Rains further intensified across the country and affected mostly western governorates, while Hodeidah and Al Mahwit suffered the most damage with housing, livestock and livelihoods washed away and IDP sites damaged (OCHA, August 2019). In September and October, further heavy rains, thunderstorms and flooding hit southern areas, including IDP sites and some central areas (OCHA, October 2019).\n\nSource: Yemen IPC Technical Working Group, December 2018. The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.\n\nYemen, IPC Acute food insecurity situation, December 2018-January 2019\n\nFall armyworm reportedly damaged maize crops (FAO-GIEWS, September 2019) and swarms of locusts formed on the western coast and moved northward (FAO, December 2019), damaging crops, livestock pastures and beehives, reducing food quantities for own consumption and sale (FEWS NET, December 2019). Total cereal production in 2019 was forecast at 385 000 tonnes, about 12 percent below the previous year's harvest (FAO-GIEWS, September 2019).\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW An estimated 7.4 million people required malnutrition treatment or prevention intervention, including 3.2 million children aged 6-59 months and over 1 million pregnant and lactating women in 2019 (OCHA, February 2019).\n\nSeveral districts in Taizz, Abyan, Hajjah and Lahj governorates had a 'very high' GAM prevalence (above 20 percent), according to SMART surveys and Emergency Food and Nutrition Assessments (EFSNA) conducted between 2016 and 2019 in 74 districts of seven governorates (EFSNA/SMART, 2016-2019).\n\nNutrition surveillance in 42 districts also showed that 25 percent of children aged 6-59 months were affected by wasting and 52 percent by stunting from January-October. Results in Hodeidah have consistently shown a wasting prevalence above 30 percent since June (WHO, October 2019).\n\nWomen's dietary diversity was extremely poor with around 70 percent having a diet based on just two or three food groups (WFP, October 2019). Even before the escalation of conflict, child-feeding practices were poor with only 15 percent of 6-23 month-olds consuming the minimum acceptable diet required for growth and development (DHS, July 2015).\n\nPrevalence of anemia was a 'severe' public health concern for children aged 6-59 months (83.5 percent) and for reproductive-age women (69.6 percent) (WHO, 2016).\n\nDrinking water quality was another concern for malnutrition: 37 percent of households did not have access to 'at least basic' drinking water services (UNICEF and WHO, 2017).\n\nYemen's health care system has been devastated by conflict with almost half (49 percent) of the health facilities not or only partially functioning due to lack of staff, supplies, inability to meet operational costs or because of access constraints. Equipment at hospitals is non-functioning or obsolete, and many health personnel have not received regular salaries for two years (OCHA, December 2019). As a consequence, approximately 19.7 million people lack adequate healthcare, of whom 14 million are in acute need of assistance (ACAPS, December 2019).\n\nOver 2.2 million suspected cholera cases were reported in Yemen from October 2016-November 2019 with 3 886 related deaths (WHO, January 2020).\n\nSource: Yemen IPC Technical Working Group, July 2019 The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.\n\nArea receives significant humanitarian food assistance (accounted for in Phase classification)\n\nYemen (29 worst-affected districts), IPC Acute food insecurity situation, July-September 2019\n\nZ A M B I A | M A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9\n\nPopulation analysed 9.5M (53% of total population)\n\n2.3M IPC Phase 3 or above in October 2019-March 2020\n\nZAM BIA IPC TECHNICAL W ORKING GROUP, M AY 2019\n\n3.1M IPC Phase 2 Stressed IPC Phase 3 Crisis IPC Phase 4 Emergency 1.9M 412 000\n\nTotal population of country 17.9M\n\nZambia\n\nAcute food insecurity increased due to poor rainfall which resulted in crop failure and record high staple food prices.\n\nContinued dry-weather in areas that suffered shortfalls in crop production in 2019 is expected to sustain high humanitarian needs, but a foreseen upturn in the national agricultural output could alleviate overall acute food insecurity.\n\nSENS 2017 & UNICEF 2017\n\nSENS 2017 & UNICEF SENS 2017 & W FP 2019\n\nSENS 2017 SENS 2017\n\nThere were 62 300 refugees and asylum-seekers from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (83%), Burundi (9%) and Somalia (6%).\n\nThere were 23 300 Zambian returnees.\n\n4Adverse weather led to a sharp reduction in the 2019 cereal harvest.\n\n4Well below-average harvests curbed households' food supplies and limited income-generating opportunities.\n\n4Tight domestic supplies triggered hikes in the price of key food staples, which reached record highs and diminished households' financial capacity to access food.\n\n4Malnutrition is linked with poor child care and feeding practices as well as morbidity.\n\n58.1% of children under 5 years and 31.1% of women 15-49 years are anaemic.\n\n12% of children 6-23 months meet the minimum dietary diversity requirement.\n\n69.9% of children under 6 months are exclusively breastfed.\n\n4.2% children under 5 years are acutely malnourished, of whom 1.5% are affected by SAM.\n\n34.6% of children under 5 years are stunted.\n\n42.4-45.8% of children under 5 years and 23.7-29.1% of women 15-49 years are anaemic in Mayukwayukw and Meheba.\n\n99.7-100% of households in Meheba and Mayukwayukwa camps have access to improved drinking water sources.\n\n0.9% of households in Mayukwayuka camp and 6.4% in Meheba camp did not consume micronutrient-rich food.\n\n61.8% of children under 6 months in Mayukwayukw and 28.9% in Meheba are exclusively breastfed. children under 5 years are acutely malnourished, of whom 82 are affected by SAM. 950\n\n34.6-66.2% of children under 5 years are stunted in 3 camps.\n\nM A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9 | Z A M B I A\n\n© UNHCR/W ILL SW ANSON ZAMBIA In addition, 3.1 million people were classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) (IPC, August 2019). Acute food insecurity conditions deteriorated compared to the 2018 peak, when an estimated 17 percent of the analysed population - almost 1.2 million people - were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) (IPC, July 2018). The increase is also related to a 14 percent increase in the population size analysed between 2018 and 2019 (IPC, August 2019).\n\nAcute food insecurity among refugees The number of refugees and asylum-seekers, mainly from the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been increasing since 2016 at an average rate of about 10 percent per year (UNHCR, September 2019). Refugees in Zambia's camps, except Mantapala, are expected to work and earn their daily living since general food distribution was phased out in June 2013 (WFP, July 2019). In Mantapala, humanitarian assistance is provided to meet food and other basic needs.\n\nRefugee food security improved in 2019 compared to 2018 but deteriorated between January and September 2019. Households with inadequate (i.e. poor or borderline) food consumption increased from 32 percent in January to 68 percent in September 2019 with an increase in the use of negative consumption-based coping strategies to bridge food access gap (WFP monitoring database, extracted 18 February 2020).\n\nBACKGROUND Despite robust economic growth from 2004-2014 and progress in health and child malnutrition, poverty levels have remained stubbornly high at 76.6 percent in rural areas (CSO and WB, 2015).\n\nAlmost two-thirds of the population gains their livelihood from agriculture, yet the sector only contributes around 10 percent of GDP (RoZ, December 2018). Most farmers remain locked into low-productivity subsistence agriculture characterized by lack of access to key inputs, extension services, poor road and market infrastructure, lack of access to financial services and over-reliance on rain-fed agriculture. As a result, smallholders are very vulnerable to increased incidences of extreme and unpredictable weather events (WB, March 2018).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW An estimated 2.3 million people, representing 24 percent of the population analysed, were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) in October 2019-March 2020. Of these, an estimated 412 000 were classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4).\n\nSouthern and western areas of the country faced the highest prevalence of people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above).\n\nKatempa Chulu, a 33-year-old refugee who fled fighting in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, sells tomatoes in a bustling market in Mantapala in Zambia, which hosts around 46 000 refugees from its neighbour. The prices of key food staples reached record highs in Zambia in 2019.\n\nWeather extremes In 2019, southern parts of Zambia experienced the poorest rainfall season since 1981, which sharply reduced cereal crop production. Estimated at 2.3 million tonnes, the 2019 cereal output was about 1 million tonnes lower than the five-year average, leading to an increase in food import requirements (FAO-GIEWS, September 2019). The largest shortfalls in cereal production were in southern, western, some part of Lusaka and central provinces, which also had some of the highest rates of acute food insecurity. These areas also experienced poor harvests in 2018, which meant that households had already faced food availability constraints since late 2018 (IPC, August 2019), a situation that compounded the impact of shocks in 2019.\n\nThe crop failures in 2019 resulted in regional food deficits across southern Africa and led to a decrease in food availability at the household and market levels (IAPRI, 2019). As a consequence, many households resorted to employing negative coping strategies, including cutting the number of meals per day.\n\nA secondary impact of the lower harvests was that incomeearning opportunities for rural households were curbed, on account of reduced crop surpluses for sale and limited seasonal labour needs (FAO-GIEWS, September 2019). In parallel with the downturn in cereal production, body conditions of livestock deteriorated, reflecting the inadequate pasture and water availability. An increase in disease outbreaks among animals led to movement restrictions (IAPRI, 2019). Both these factors further curbed food availability and lowered potential earnings (IAPRI, 2019).\n\nEconomic shocks In the last decade, Zambia had become a key maize exporter in the region, but the decrease in maize production in 2019 led to the implementation of an export ban, as the country sought to stabilize domestic supplies and ease pressure on prices from export-driven demand (FEWS NET, September 2019).\n\nThe lower food stocks from own production also made rural households more reliant on markets to meet their consumption needs. As a result of these supply shortages and increased demand, prices of the main food staples increased sharply. The retail price of maize products rose by 50-70 percent between 2018 and 2019 (FAO-GIEWS, January 2020 and WFP, 2019).\n\nTo prevent further rises and ease access to food, the government, in agreement with millers, retailers and grain traders, introduced a ceiling on maize grain prices in August 2019 (FAO-GIEWS, September 2019). The depreciation of the national currency and higher import costs exerted further upward pressure on food prices (WB, October 2019).\n\nSource: Zambia IPC Technical Working Group, July 2018.

In 2018, acute malnutrition was down by two percentage points to 4.2 percent of children aged 6-59 months, considered a 'low' prevalence, with 1.5 percent severely wasted. Muchinga province recorded the highest rate (8.2 percent, 'medium'), followed by Luapula (6.2 percent), Lusaka (5.5 percent) and Copperbelt (5.4 percent).\n\nHowever, at 34.6 percent, the national prevalence of stunting was considered 'very high' - though down from 40 percent in 2014/15 (DHS, 2018). Rates ranged from 46 percent in the northern province to 29 percent in western and southern provinces (DHS, 2018).\n\nHigh levels of chronic malnutrition can be at least partly attributed to inadequate infant and young child-feeding practices. Only 42.1 percent of infants below 6 months were exclusively breastfed and 12 percent of children aged 6-23 months received a minimum acceptable diet. These factors also likely contribute to the 'very high' (58.1 percent) anaemia levels among 6-59 month-old children. Anaemia among women was a 'moderate' public health concern at 31.1 percent, reaching 41.1 percent ('severe') among pregnant women (DHS, 2018).\n\nA cholera outbreak was declared on 17 October 2019 (ZNPHI, October 2019) with over 1 500 cases reported during 2019 across the country (WHO, December 2019). An estimated 1.2 million Zambians are living with HIV even though the prevalence has declined since 2001-2002. (UNAIDS, 2018).\n\nThe failure of two rainy seasons resulted in more than 20 000 drought-affected people lacking access to clean and safe water in November (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nNutrition status of refugees The nutrition and health status of the refugees in the three settlements has been stable over the past few years. The 2017 SENS nutrition survey found 'medium' acute malnutrition prevalence in Mayukwayukwa (6.2 percent) and Meheba (5.7 percent) (SENS, 2017). The 2019 nutrition survey in Mantapala settlement found 'low' levels of acute malnutrition (2.9 percent) (UNICEF 2019). The prevalence of stunting was 'very high' in all three camps, at 34.6 percent in Mayukwayukwa and Meheba, rising to 66.2 percent in Mantapala (SENS, 2017 and UNICEF 2019).\n\nChild-feeding practices in Meheba and Mayukwayukwa showed a diverse result. While 61.8 percent of children were exclusively breastfed for 6 months in Mayukwayukwa, the prevalence fell to 28.9 percent in Meheba (SENS, 2017). Both camps failed to meet the 95 percent UNHCR target for measles vaccination. As for the WASH situation, only 25.3 percent of households in Mayukwayukwa and 12.4 percent in Meheba reported using an improved toilet, which indicates an urgent need for better hygiene (SENS, 2017).\n\nSource: Zambia IPC Technical Working Group, August 2019 The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.\n\nZambia, IPC Acute food insecurity situation, October 2019-March 2020\n\nZ I M B A B W E | M A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9\n\nPopulation analysed 9.4M (64% of total population)\n\n3.6M IPC Phase 3 or above in October-December 2019\n\nZIM BABW E IPC TECHNICAL W ORKING GROUP JUNE 2019\n\n2.7M IPC Phase 2 Stressed IPC Phase 3 Crisis IPC Phase 4 Emergency 2.5M 1.1M\n\n68% Rural 32% Urban Total population of country 14.6M\n\nZimbabwe\n\nIn 2019, Zimbabwe experienced its worst drought in decades, which, in tandem with the impacts of Cyclone Idai and a severe economic crisis that sent food prices spiraling created the country's worst acute food insecurity crisis in 10 years.\n\nA major deterioration in food insecurity is expected as a result of persisting economic difficulties, eroded household resilience, rainfall deficits and forecast low harvests.\n\nUNHCR DEC 2019 IOM M AY 2019\n\nDHS 2018 M ICS 2019 ZIM VAC 2019\n\n51 000 Zimbabweans were internally displaced by cyclone Idai.\n\nThere were 21 400 refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (52%) and Mozambique (38%).\n\nEconomic shocks Weather extremes 4Spiraling inflation and a dire shortage of local currency severely cut purchasing power.\n\n4High prices of cereal products severely constrained access to food for low-income households.\n\n4Low foreign currency supplies reduced Zimbabwe's capacity to access food imports.\n\n4Severe drought and below-average rains sharply reduced the 2019 harvest.\n\n4Cyclone Idai caused severe damages with around 270 000 people affected in March.\n\n4Deteriorating food insecurity and health conditions (inflation of the prices of medicines, cholera outbreak at the end of 2018 and progressive increase in the rates of diarrhoeal disease) contributed to increasing levels of child malnutrition.\n\nNUTRITION INDICATORS 58.1% of children under 5 years and 31.1% of women 15-49 years are anaemic.\n\n64% of households have access to at least basic drinking water services.\n\n17% of children 6-23 months meet the minimum dietary diversity requirement.\n\n42% of children under 6 months are exclusively breastfed.\n\n3.6% of children under 5 years are acutely malnourished, of whom 1.4% are affected by SAM.\n\n24% of children under 5 years are stunted.\n\nM A J O R F O O D C R I S E S I N 2 0 1 9 | Z I M B A B W E\n\n© W FP/M ATTEO COSORICH ZIMBABWE Phase 3) if their livelihoods were not supported. Of particular concern were the nine districts classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), where the results of the ZimVAC IPC analysis demonstrated an increase in the number of people facing food consumption gaps and forced to employ emergency strategies, thus jeopardizing their future (IPC, August 2019). The deepening hardship forced families to eat less, skip meals, take children out of school, sell off livestock and fall into a vicious cycle of debt.\n\nLittle respite is expected for the most vulnerable, including subsistence farmers, who grow most of Zimbabwe's food and depend on a single, increasingly erratic rainy season (WFP, December 2019).\n\nEconomic shocks The persisting poor macroeconomic environment, marked by hyperinflation, continued to drive the appalling acute food insecurity situation (IPC, August 2019). In July, annual inflation reached 230 percent. Extreme poverty was estimated to have risen from 29 percent in 2018 to 34 percent in 2019, meaning that 5.7 million Zimbabweans were living in extreme poverty in 2019 (WB, October 2019).\n\nBACKGROUND Zimbabwe has only experienced normal rainfall in two of the last five growing seasons. It is also experiencing an economic crisis characterized by a significant shortage of currency, hyperinflation, lack of fuel and prolonged power outages that have crippled industry and work opportunities (WFP, December 2019).\n\nWidespread poverty, high levels of HIV/AIDS and low crop productivity also undermine food security (WFP, 2019). As a result, Zimbabwe is experiencing one of its worst acute food insecurity crises in a decade, with atypically high humanitarian food assistance needs (FEWS NET, November 2019 and United Nations, December 2019).\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW From October-December 2019, an estimated 3.6 million rural inhabitants were classified in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above). This includes over 1.1 million facing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) conditions. This was a marked deterioration compared with the 2018 end-of-year peak (IPC, August 2019).\n\nAn additional 2.7 million rural inhabitants classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) were at risk of slipping into Crisis (IPC Drought and economic crisis have severely affected smallholder farmers like Elias Shamba. Following two failed rounds of planting and a very early start to the lean season he has borrowed money in order to get his land tilled.\n\nThe Zimbabwe dollar (ZWL) depreciated by 520 percent between February and late October, mostly due to continued critical foreign currency shortages (FEWS NET, October 2019). The government made it the only legal tender in June 2019, ending the multi-currency regime that was in place for over a decade, but the ZWL continued to fall in value.\n\nIn October, retail prices of maize meal were more than eight times higher than the previous year because of the weak currency, reduced domestic supplies following a droughtinduced 2019 harvest and foreign exchange shortages that curtailed imports (FAO-GIEWS, December 2019).\n\nIn December, most markets, even in typical surplus production areas, were without maize grain, increasing demand for maize meal and further contributing to high maize meal prices (FEWS NET, December 2019).\n\nThe low cereal harvests in the 2018/2019 agricultural season depleted household incomes from agricultural-related activities, further compounding the effects of inflated food prices (FAO-GIEWS, October 2019).\n\nWhile casual labour remained the main income for 30 percent of rural families, those relying on food crop sales reduced from 22 percent in 2018 to 8 percent in 2019. Cash shortages remained the most influential stressors experienced by households, followed by increases in cereal prices and drought, particularly in the provinces of Manicaland and Midlands (SADC, October 2019).\n\nWeather extremes In 2019, Zimbabwe experienced its worst drought in decades, with temperatures hitting 50 degrees Celsius in some areas (WFP, January 2020). The limited access to or non-existent irrigation facilities increased farmers' vulnerability (WFP, December 2019).\n\nThe record-high temperatures in late October to early November affected water sources, agricultural activities and livestock. A high number of cattle deaths were reported in southern and western areas mainly due to livestock diseases (IPC, August 2019), but also to poor pasture conditions and water availability (FEWS NET, November 2019).\n\nCyclone Idai hit the country in March 2019 and affected around 270 000 people across nine districts in the eastern region as well as parts of southern Zimbabwe. The flooding and landslides that followed caused severe damages to crop and agriculture infrastructure (OCHA, August 2019).\n\nRainfall conditions were near to average from October- December 2019 despite late onset of rains countrywide and false starts in the southern and south-eastern parts of the country. Nevertheless, crop establishment was significantly affected (FEWS NET, October 2019).\n\nAt about 780 000 metric tonnes, Zimbabwe's 2018/19 national maize production was over 40 percent below the five-year average (FAO-GIEWS, October 2019).

Out of the 60 administrative rural districts only 11 had enough cereal to last until the next harvest (OCHA, August 2019). Import requirements were significantly above the average.\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW Due to worsening acute food insecurity, inflation, a cholera outbreak from the end of 2018 and progressive increase in the rates of diarrheal disease, child nutritional status worsened (SADC, October 2019).\n\nAlthough acute malnutrition among children under 5 years of age remained 'low', it rose to 3.6 percent in 2019 from 2.5 percent in 2018. A higher prevalence of GAM was recorded in Makoni (7.4 percent), Mutare (5 percent), Seke (5.7 percent), Mhondoro-Ngezi (5.8 percent), Sanya (5.5 percent), Binga (6.1 percent), Lupane (5.2 percent), Masvingo (7.4 percent) and Goromonzi (19.3 percent) (ZimVAC, 2019). Stunting affected 24 percent of children (MICS, 2019).\n\nOf particular concern is that only 11 percent of children aged 6-23 months consumed a minimum acceptable diet. Even though 83 percent of children were breastfed until their first birthday, only 42 percent were exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months (MICS, 2019). These were also likely to contribute to the severe anaemia levels among children (WHO, 2016) as well as the stunting levels.\n\nAround half of rural households lacked access to basic water sources. Almost a third (31 percent) used open defecation (MICS, 2019). Water treatment plants have critical shortages of chemicals due to lack of foreign currency (OCHA, October 2019). Around 780 000 people were at risk of WASH-related disease outbreaks (OCHA, August 2019).\n\nHIV/AIDS remained high in Zimbabwe with 12.7 percent of adults or 1.3 million people affected, almost 61 percent of them women (UNAIDS, 2018).\n\nZimbabwe was also dealing with widespread and worsening lack of essential medicine coupled with poor access to health services (OCHA, October 2019).\n\nA C U T E F O O D I N S E C U R I T Y A N D M A L N U T R I T I O N F O R E C A S T S F O R 2 0 2 0\n\nREGIONAL FORECAST FOR EAST AFRICA Abundant seasonal rains from mid-2019 benefitted crops and rangelands but also brought damaging floods, and fostered a severe desert locust outbreak that will likely aggravate acute food insecurity in 2020.\n\nDjibouti\n\nIn January 2020, 175 000 people were acutely food insecure, representing 27 percent of the rural population and 23 percent of urban dwellers in the five regions. The most-affected regions were Dikhil and Obock where 44-49 percent of the population was acutely food insecure, compared to 13 percent in Tadjourah, Ali Sabieh and Arta. Since late 2019, average to above-average rainfall and pasture and water availability improved livestock body conditions and benefitted pastoralist households through normal livestock production and sales (USAID, February 2020). However, the situation of some rural populations could deteriorate as around 27 000 people, who are largely reliant on agropastoralism, are living in areas affected by desert locust infestations (FAO and Government of Djibouti, January 2020).\n\nThe number of acutely food-insecure people in need of urgent assistance - in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) - is projected to seasonally increase from 6.7 million in October 2019-January 2020 to 8.5 million in February-June 2020, due to the depletion of stocks from 2019 harvests (IPC, November 2019). The highest prevalence of acute food insecurity is expected in the pastoral Somali and Afar regions, where the lingering impact of consecutive poor rainy seasons has resulted\n\nAcute food insecurity and malnutrition forecasts for 2020 in significant livestock losses, as well as in agropastoral areas of eastern Oromiya region, where herd sizes are below-average and the 2019 Belg harvest was reduced. The recent desert locust infestation will likely contribute to diminished agricultural production, placing additional pressure on an already complex and fragile food security context. Since June 2019, six regions have experienced an infestation of desert locusts (Afar, Amhara, Dire Dawa, Oromia, Somali and Tigray), and by early 2020, the swarms were reported as having moved towards the Rift Valley, which is considered the breadbasket of Ethiopia (FAO, 2020).\n\nA general election scheduled for August could worsen ongoing civil unrest and intercommunal violence. Further displacement of people is likely. Inflation is rising, driving up food prices (WFP, January 2020). The overall condition of IDPs and returnees will continue to be dire as hygiene and sanitation, as well as shelter conditions, are often inadequate (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nIn the northern and eastern pastoral areas of Garissa, Mandera, Marsabit, Samburu, Tana River, Turkana and Wajir counties, the abundant 2019 October-December short rains boosted livestock conditions and productivity. This generally improved acute food insecurity levels from Crisis (IPC Phase 3) in late 2019 to Stressed (IPC Phase 2) conditions in early 2020. These levels are expected to prevail until July 2020 based on IPC February 2020 results. However, households that were the most affected by floods in Mandera, Tana River and Wajir counties are likely to remain in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Desert locust swarms in northern and central areas, as well as along the shores of Lake Turkana in February 2020 were expected to expand further into the north-eastern areas of the country (FAO, 2020). For the period April-July 2020, 985 000 people in Kenya's ASALs were expected to face Crisis conditions or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) (IPC, April 2020).\n\nNumber of acutely food-insecure people forecast to: p increase in 2020; q decrease in 2020; u persist in 2020 at 2019 levels\n\nThe acute food insecurity forecasts included in this chapter were produced before COVID-19 became a pandemic and do not account for its hypothetical consequences.

In the period from April-June, the number of acutely food-insecure people was projected to increase by 13 percent to 1.3 million people, mainly driven by substantial crop and pasture losses due to desert locusts, and the main Gu harvest, to be gathered in July, forecast at 15-25 percent below-average. Forecast above-average April-June Gu rains were expected to cause the Juba and Shabelle rivers to overflow after very high water flows and levels in late 2019 had damaged embankments. This was likely to lead to additional crop production shortfalls in riverine areas (FSNAU-FEWS NET, February 2020).\n\nAcute food insecurity levels are forecast to remain poor throughout the first half of 2020 as the lean season is exacerbated by ongoing local conflicts, years of conflict-related asset depletion, a crippled economy, poorly functioning markets and lack of infrastructure. In addition, northern and eastern areas that were devastated by floods in late 2019 incurred severe livelihood losses. An estimated 63 percent of the 2020 national cereal needs have been met by harvests, while the ongoing economic crisis will continue to inhibit households' purchasing power and push up food prices. The number of people facing Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) levels of acute food insecurity is set to rise from nearly 5.3 million (45 percent of the population) in January 2020 to 6.5 million (55 percent of the population) by May-July. The highest prevalence of acute food insecurity will likely be in Jonglei State, the area worst affected by the floods, where close to 73 percent of the population will face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) levels by the middle of the year (IPC, February 2020).\n\nThe Sudan\n\nA deterioration of the acute food insecurity situation is expected until the end of the lean season in September 2020, with seasonal trends exacerbated by an earlier than usual depletion of food stocks from the reduced 2019 harvest and the worsening macroeconomic situation, which is driving extremely high food and non-food prices and constraining food access. Despite availability of newly harvested cereal crops in January 2020, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) levels continue for IDPs in SPLM-N-controlled areas of South Kordofan. They also persist for IDPs and conflictaffected households in Jebel Marra region in Darfur, and in several areas of Abyei, northern parts of North Darfur, parts of North Kordofan and parts of Kassala and Red Sea states.\n\nFrom February-May 2020, acute food insecurity is expected to deteriorate further, with Crisis (IPC Phase 3) levels expected in\n\nNorth Kordofan and Red Sea states, in areas affected by flooding in Blue Nile, Kassala and White Nile states and for additional households in North Darfur. In the absence of humanitarian assistance, IDPs and conflict-affected people in parts of SPLM-Ncontrolled areas of Blue Nile and South Kordofan states, and IDPs in parts of Jebel Marra region are likely to face Emergency (IPC Phase 4). From June-September, 5-6 million people are expected to be acutely food insecure and in need of urgent assistance (FEWS NET, February 2020).\n\nNationally, acute food insecurity is at minimal levels, thanks to the above-average second season harvest, gathered in January 2020. However, Stressed (IPC Phase 2) acute food security levels in Bundibugyo district are expected to rise through May due to recent floods, landslides and severe crop damage, which left little or no harvests available for own consumption or sale. High food prices have forced many households in flood-affected areas to reduce the quantity and frequency of meals.\n\nIn the agropastoral north-eastern Karamoja region, below-average crop production will result in an earlier-than-usual depletion of household cereal stocks. However, abundant rains in the second half of 2019 improved livestock conditions and productivity, and an above-average availability of livestock products will maintain acute food security at Stressed (IPC Phase 2) levels. Refugees from South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo could face deteriorating acute food insecurity if adequate levels of humanitarian assistance are not provided. Acute food security conditions could deteriorate further in the face of the recent arrival of a mature swarm of desert locusts in February 2020 (FAO 2020). Considering these factors, from May-June 2020, 1.2-1.6 million people will likely face Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) conditions (FEWS NET, February 2020).\n\nREGIONAL FORECAST FOR CENTRAL AFRICA Protracted conflict/insecurity in tandem with the damages incurred by 2019 flooding in many areas will either maintain or increase acute food insecurity levels in parts of Central Africa\n\nThe Central African Republic\n\nSeven years since the start of the conflict, despite the 2019 peace agreement between the Government and several armed groups, severe insecurity was expected to persist in 2020, mainly in western Ouham and Ouham-Pendé prefectures and in eastern and south-eastern Basse-Kotto, Haut-Mbomou, Mbomou and Haute-Kotto prefectures. Violence may further increase in the run-up to the election in 2020 (WFP, January 2020). The number of people facing Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) is set to rise from nearly 1.6 million (35 percent of the population) in the\n\nThe worst desert locust upsurge in decades is spreading across East Africa, threatening the livelihoods and food security of the region's rural population. It is the worst upsurge Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia have experienced in the last 25 years, Uganda in 60 years and in Kenya in 70 years (FAO).\n\nThe upsurge began in the Arabian Peninsula in 2018 after successive cyclones led to favourable breeding conditions, and ongoing conflict in Yemen limited pest control operations. By mid-2019, swarms had reached the Horn of Africa (northern Somalia, southern Eritrea and northern and eastern Ethiopia).\n\nExceptionally heavy rains across East Africa exacerbated locust reproduction, and by late 2019 and early 2020, the pests had also spread to coastal areas of the Sudan and Eritrea, central and southern Somalia, southern Ethiopia, Kenya, eastern Uganda and south-eastern South Sudan. Some locusts were also reported in northern United Republic of Tanzania and in north-eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nMost areas infected by desert locusts, as of 17 February, were facing either Stressed (IPC Phase 2) or Crisis (IPC Phase 3) food security outcomes. Crop and pasture losses had generally been minimal in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia with the exception of northern and south-eastern Tigray, north-eastern Amhara, and eastern Oromia regions in Ethiopia which reported localized damages to the Meher crops in 2019.\n\nAccording to FAO's Locust Watch, a favourable climate forecast in 2020 will likely cause the pest to spread, with the start of the long rains season in March-April of particular concern as it corresponds with the regeneration of rangelands and the start of planting activities. Though control operations were underway, they were hampered by limited resources, as well as conflict and insecurity in Somalia and north-eastern Kenya.\n\nThe impact on future food security will be highly dependent on the magnitude of production losses, both in marginal agricultural zones and in key surplus production areas, as well as for rangeland resources. In this context, the Greater Horn of Africa Food Security and Nutrition Working Group (FSNWG) has developed two scenarios based on the likelihood of infestations and expected impacts on crops, rangelands and ultimately the food security of local populations.\n\nIn the most likely scenario, households in areas where swarms have caused damages - particularly those relying on cropping activities that are already Stressed (IPC Phase 2) or worse - will experience significant impact on food security. Given the average-to-above-average rainfall forecast for the region, the main assumption rests on significant crop losses for affected households, resulting in below-average production in some areas at a sub-national level, but the impact on national production and agricultural labour wages will be minimal. Vulnerable populations already affected by recent shocks and facing elevated levels of acute food insecurity are likely to face further deterioration, particularly in late 2020 and peaking during the 2021 lean season.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, desert locust infestations would 1) cause significant losses during the 2020 main and secondary seasons, resulting in below-average harvests, and 2) cause major pasture and browse losses in arid and semi-arid regions, resulting in a more dire food security outlook. Food access, availability and stocks would be reduced. Pastoralists who face reduced rangeland availability would likely resort to atypical migration, thus accelerating the depletion of scarce rangeland resources and increasing the risks of livestock diseases and the likelihood of resource-based conflicts. Migration options would remain limited for the poorest pastoralists and for those living in conflict-affected areas. Under this scenario, a deterioration in food security outcomes would likely begin in mid-2020.\n\nSource: FSNWG. 2020. Special Report - East Africa desert locust and Food Security Update: Current Upsurge Threatens Upcoming 2020 Agricultural Season. 17 February.\n\nEast Africa desert locust upsurge\n\n© FAO/Sven Torfinn September 2019-April 2020 post-harvest period to 2.1 million (47 percent of the population) in the May-August 2020 lean period. This represents a 17 percent increase compared with the same period in 2019.\n\nIn the areas most affected by insecurity, where large numbers of IDPs are located, the seasonal deterioration of the food security situation will be compounded by conflict-related livelihood losses and disruptions. From May-August 2020, Emergency (IPC Phase 4) levels of acute food insecurity are expected to prevail in several areas of Basse Kotto, Nana Gribizi, Ouaka, Ouham, Ouham-Pendé and Vakaga prefectures and in parts of Haut-Mboumou, Kemo, Mambére-Kadei, Mboumou and Sangha-Mbaéré prefectures (IPC, November 2019).\n\nRwanda and Burundi\n\nWith conflict leading to large population displacements from neighbouring countries, food security needs in Burundi and Rwanda are expected to remain significant in 2020 among displaced populations, in particular. Both countries hosted close to 76 000 Congolese refugees each in late 2019 (UNHCR, February 2020). In addition, around 73 000 Burundian refugees were displaced in Rwanda, having fled political unrest from April 2015 (UNHCR, February 2020), and 113 000 people were internally displaced in Burundi mainly because of weather events as of January 2020 (IOM, February 2020).\n\nIn Burundi, above-average rainfall from late 2019 led to flooding, landslides and damaged crops. In Rwanda, food prices were unusually high in early 2020 as a result of increased transport costs and trade disruptions caused by torrential rains as well as reduced imports from Uganda (FEWS NET, February 2020; FAOGIEWS, January 2020). However, in both countries above-average harvest prospects were expected to support Minimal (IPC Phase 1) food security outcomes through May 2020. Around 150 000-350 000 people in Burundi as well as 85 000-125 000 in Rwanda are likely to face Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) levels of acute food insecurity (FEWS NET, February 2020).\n\nREGIONAL FORECAST FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA Post-harvest improvements are likely to be short-lived as poor rains, high food prices and unresolved political and economic instability could worsen acute food insecurity.\n\nAngola and Namibia\n\nImproved seasonal rainfall has helped regenerate pasture and water resources and boost crop production prospects in 2020 in southern Angola and northern Namibia, following extreme dry conditions in the previous year. Agricultural production is expected to increase and contribute to an improvement in food security. In early 2020, Angola had 0.6 million and Namibia had 0.4 million acutely food-insecure people in Crisis or above (IPC Phase 3 or worse). This situation is mainly due to poor weather conditions in 2019. A slight decrease in acute food insecurity is projected through September in Namibia (IPC, October 2019).\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo\n\nAcute food insecurity is expected to remain extremely concerning in conflict-affected eastern regions in 2020. In areas of Ituri, North Kivu and South Kivu provinces, where conflict intensified in 2019, the early 2020 harvest was expected to be below average because of disrupted agricultural activities and flood-related crop losses. Faster-than-normal depletion of household food stocks will result in an early onset of the lean season. In parts of Kasai Central, an outbreak of cassava mosaic virus could result in substantial crop losses. Maize availability is affected by reduced imports from neighbouring Zambia and Zimbabwe, where poor seasonal rains reduced 2019 maize harvests.\n\nDespite the start of harvests, in January 2020 Crisis (IPC Phase 3) levels of acute food insecurity were expected to prevail through May in 17 out of 22 provinces analysed, with particularly high prevalence (35-45 percent) in Haut-Uele, Ituri, Kasai, Kasai Oriental and Tanganyika. The acute food insecurity situation is expected to further deteriorate in these areas with the progress of the lean season until July, when newly harvested crops will be available for consumption.\n\nAround 13.6 million people were projected to face Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) from January-May, including 3.6 million in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). These numbers reflect an improvement in some areas, such as Greater Kasai, due to expected improved security conditions and favourable rainfall. In parts of Ituri, Samkuru, South Kivu and Tanganyika, the acute food insecurity situation may worsen (IPC, August 2019).\n\nThere was still a high risk of re-emergence of the Ebola virus disease in early 2020 (WHO, March 2020).\n\nEswatini and Lesotho In early 2020, both countries' food security levels are expected to remain on a par with late 2019. In Eswatini, drier weather conditions towards the end of the cropping season are likely to maintain near-average cereal production levels in 2020, and food security is therefore anticipated to remain mostly stable. In Lesotho, a production recovery is expected to bolster national food supplies and reduce the number of people in need of assistance by the end of 2020. Eswatini had 0.2 and Lesotho had 0.4 million people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) from January-March 2020. A production upturn in South Africa, the sub-region's main exporter and producer, would likely further underpin food security improvement. Its production of cereals is forecast at well above-average levels, and this boost to supplies will likely reduce prices, thereby helping to improve access to food staples for import-dependent countries (IPC, July 2019).\n\nThe larger agricultural output in southern and south-eastern Madagascar in 2019 was projected to lead to a reduction in acute food insecurity, with an estimated 0.7 million people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) in the January-March 2020 lean season. The population in these districts has limited capacity to withstand and recover from weather shocks, and even small production downturns can provoke a sharp deterioration in acute food insecurity.\n\nThe situation is worst in West Ampanihy District, where 30 percent of the population is expected to be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). The number of acutely food-insecure people is expected to seasonally decrease to 0.4 million from April-June (IPC, November 2019). A forecast contraction in national paddy production following erratic distribution of seasonal rains could push up food prices and lower food supplies at the local level, straining food security later in the year.\n\nFood security levels are expected to improve with a forecast above-average 2020 harvest, based on generally conducive weather. However, high staple food prices are likely to prevent a large reduction in food assistance needs. Around 1.9 million people face Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) acute food security outcomes until March 2020 (IPC, January 2020).\n\nIn some areas affected by cyclones Kenneth and Idai in 2019, the recovery process may be slower than expected due to severe weather including heavy rains and flooding, hailstorms and strong winds. In central provinces, the adverse weather is expected to result in localised shortfalls in production for a second consecutive year in 2020. Meanwhile, southern provinces of Mozambique have faced drought conditions. Insufficient and erratic rainfall resulted in multiple rounds of planting and production is expected to be well below average for the third consecutive season (FEWS NET, January 2020). Political and economic instability, if unresolved, could trigger violence and displacement (OCHA, December 2019). From January-February 2020, around 1.7 million people faced Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) (IPC, July 2019).\n\nThe United Republic of Tanzania Acute food insecurity is expected to remain at similar levels during the lean season in early 2020. From May, the number of acutely food-insecure people (IPC Phase 3 or above) is projected to decline from about 1 million in November 2019-April 2020 to about 0.5 million (IPC, February 2020). This is the result of the 'msimu' harvests which are expected to increase cereal availability and 'masika' harvest which will boost availability. However, political and economic instability, if unresolved, could trigger violence and displacement (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nWhile conditions may improve at the national level, they may worsen in the south where heavy rainfall since the beginning of January led to riverine and flash floods. The flooding destroyed crops, including maize, in some of the areas heavily affected by the last season's drought, according to the Government's Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU). In addition, erratic rains and dry spells at the beginning of the rainy season in November had already compromised the planting period in the southern region. These recurrent climate shocks could aggravate the already fragile food security situation. From March, food security levels were expected to improve based on a forecast increase in the national cereal output. However, high prices of staple foods are likely to inhibit a more substantial improvement. Around 2.3 million people were expected to face Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) levels of acute food insecurity during the lean season in October 2019-March 2020 (IPC November 2019).\n\nThe alarming acute food insecurity situation is expected to worsen in 2020. Persisting economic difficulties have eroded the resilience of households. Given limited indications that there will be a significant turnaround in the economy during the first half of 2020, households are likely to continue to face severe food access constraints. Early rainfall deficits caused permanent wilting of crops in localized areas, while erratic rainfall is expected to result in a decline in crop productivity in the 2019/2020 season.\n\nThe ongoing economic crisis has hindered farmers' access to agricultural inputs, causing a reduction in the area planted with maize. The 2020 harvest is forecast to remain below the five-year average, which would sustain a tight supply situation and curtail potential earnings from crop sales for farming households. As a result, the acutely food-insecure rural population in need of urgent action is estimated at 4.3 million up to June 2020 (IPC, March 2020).\n\nREGIONAL FORECAST FOR WEST AFRICA, THE SAHEL AND CAMEROON Increasing violence and displacement in conflict-affected areas as well as weather extremes and disrupted regional trade will drive up acute food insecurity in many countries of West Africa.\n\nThe escalation of conflict in northern areas (Nord, Centre-Nord and Sahel regions) and its spread to the eastern areas (Est region) is driving one the world's fastest growing humanitarian crises. The number in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) during the June-August 2020 lean season is forecast at 2.2 million, three times the estimated number in the same period last year (RPCA, April 2020). The sharp increase in the number and gravity of violent episodes had displaced 765 000 people as of February 2020 - a 16-fold increase compared to January 2019 - resulting in severe livelihood losses (UNHCR, February 2020). In conflictaffected areas, many farmers have been forced to abandon their fields, while pastoralists have faced restricted animal access to pasture and water points as well as episodes of cattle raiding. Food markets are either closed or poorly attended by traders, sellers and buyers, while road ambushes and the looting of trucks have disrupted trade flows between the country's main western cereal-producing areas and the northern conflict-affected, cereal deficit areas (FEWS NET, January 2020). Constraints to humanitarian access often result in irregular and reduced food assistance operations.\n\nContinued violence and instability will continue to drive high levels of acute food insecurity. About 2.7 million people are forecast to be in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) levels of acute food insecurity from January-March 2020 before reducing to 2.1 million in June-August 2020 (CILSS-CH, March 2020). Boko Haram attacks in the Far North region continue, as does the precarious situation in North West and South West regions, where clashes between armed secessionists and security forces are disrupting agricultural and market activities and causing new displacements. Reduced exports to Nigeria also disrupt livestock and agricultural trade flows, lowering the purchasing power of producers (FEWS NET, January 2020). As of January 2020, the number of IDPs was estimated at 977 000, in addition to 293 Central African refugees and 111 000 Nigerian refugees (UNHCR, January 2020).\n\nThe number of acutely food-insecure people in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) during the June-August 2020 lean season is forecast at 1.0 million, 60 percent higher than the estimated number in the same period last year (CILSS-CH, March 2020). This sharp deterioration is mainly driven by heightened violence in conflict-affected Lac and Tibesti regions, resulting in new displacements and increasing food prices. Climatic events, such as prolonged dry spells in Bahr El Ghazal, Hadjer, Kanem and Lamis regions, are contributing to deteriorating crop and livestock conditions (FEWS NET, January 2020). Meanwhile, floods in Mandoul and Moyen-Chari regions in October resulted in displacements and livelihood losses (FEWS NET, October 2019).\n\nCôte d'Ivoire and Sierra Leone\n\nWith 2019 crop production lower than the previous year, food prices are expected to remain high in Sierra Leone in 2020. Currency depreciation could also limit food access for the most vulnerable, market-dependent populations (RPCA, April 2020). The border closures in Nigeria continue to disrupt regional trade and result in economic and food losses in countries across the region, such as Côte d'Ivoire (RPCA, April 2020), where the appreciated value of the CFA franc against the USD will further affect exports and producers' incomes (ADB, January 2020).\n\nThe Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and Mauritania Around 1.1 million are expected to be facing Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) from June-August 2020 in these four countries (RPCA, April 2020). With 2019 crop production lower than the previous year, food prices are expected to remain high in the Gambia. Currency depreciation in Guinea could also limit food access for the most vulnerable, market-dependent populations (RPCA, April 2020). Prices of cashew nuts in Guinea-Bissau are likely to remain below the government-fixed price level, and could further decrease following the next harvest, significantly constraining rural populations' incomes and access to food.\n\nMauritania has experienced a third consecutive year of pasture deficits in border areas, placing additional pressure on pastoralists and natural resources (FEWS NET, February 2020). Floods contributed to localized crop production shortfalls in southern areas. Despite well-supplied markets and stable food prices, an early onset of the lean season in 2020 and increased market reliance of agro-pastoral and pastoralist households is expected (FEWS NET, January 2020). Around 610 000 people are forecast to be in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) during the lean season in June-August 2020 (RPCA, April 2020).\n\nWhile security improved in northern areas in 2019, insecurity is severely affecting the more populated central areas, where armed groups are mostly targeting civilians. As of January, persisting insecurity in the Liptako Gourma areas and in Menaka continued to disturb movements of livestock, which could worsen body conditions (FEWS NET, January 2020). Violence and displacement are forecast to continue in 2020. As a result, about 1.3 million people are expected to face Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) during the June-August 2020 lean season. This is more than double the estimated 2019 lean season number. Forty percent of the projected acutely food-insecure population is located in the central Mopti region (RPCA, April 2020).\n\nThe Niger\n\nThe number of people facing Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) during the June-August 2020 lean season is forecast at 2.0 million, more than 70 percent higher than the same period last year (CILSS-CH, March 2020). This can be attributed to the prolonged conflict in neighbouring Burkina Faso, Mali and Nigeria spreading into the Niger, disrupting agriculture, transport and markets and resulting in displacement, particularly in Diffa, Tahoua and Tillabery regions. Dry spells, floods and pest attacks in 2019 affected crop production (down 6 percent compared to 2018 levels) particularly in parts of Dosso, Maradi, Tahoua and Tillabery regions, leading to an expected earlier-than-usual onset of the lean season (CILSS and Ministère de l'Agriculture et de l'Elevage, November 2019). Drought conditions, limited animal mobility due to conflict and the closure of the border with Nigeria have curtailed the demand for livestock and driven down livestock prices, negatively affecting pastoralist household incomes and purchasing power in 2020 (FEWS NET, January 2020).\n\nNorthern Nigeria\n\nThe number of acutely food-insecure people (CH Phase 3 or above) during the June-August 2020 lean season is forecast at 7.1 million, over 40 percent up from the same period last year (CILSS-CH, March 2020). The expected deterioration is mainly due to the intensification of armed violence in conflict-affected north-eastern areas (Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states), where tight supplies continue to sustain high food prices. In these states, around 3.7 million people were expected to be facing Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) in June-August 2020 - which constitutes a significant increase (23 percent) compared to the same period in 2019. Escalating intercommunal conflict and armed banditry in north-western and central areas (Kaduna, Katsina, Kebbi, Kogi, Nasarawa, Niger, Plateau and Zamfara states), and widespread floods from June-October 2019 also resulted in localized livelihood losses, affecting the food security of local populations in 2020 (FEWS NET, January 2020). Border closures continue to limit food imports - particularly of rice - and drive up prices (FAO-GIEWS, February 2020).\n\nSenegal\n\nPoor and erratic rainfall and prolonged dry spells have led to pasture deficits for a third consecutive year in areas bordering Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali and the Niger and created additional pressure on pastoral households and natural resources (FEWS NET, February 2020). Floods affected crop production, contributing to a fall in cereal production (down 4 percent compared to 2018). Despite well-supplied markets and stable food prices, an early onset of the lean season in 2020 and increased market reliance of agropastoral and pastoralist households is expected (FEWS NET, January 2020). Around 767 000 people are forecast to be in Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above) during the lean season in June-August 2020 (CILSSCH, March 2020).\n\nREGIONAL FORECAST FOR ASIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST Violent conflict will drive alarming rates of acute food insecurity and acute malnutrition across the most troubled areas of this region.\n\nIn Afghanistan, high levels of acute food insecurity and malnutrition are expected in 2020 due to the cumulative impacts of decades of war, continued insecurity, repeated displacement, the lingering impact of the drought in rural areas, annual flooding, and related interruptions to agriculture. Other notable contributors to acute food insecurity include widespread unemployment, loss of livelihoods, grinding poverty, high market reliance and elevated food prices (OCHA, December 2019). Given the political instability, the security outlook for early 2020 looks mostly unchanged from 2019. Average rainfall levels are expected in 2020 (OCHA, December 2019). Some 11.3 million people were estimated to be in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) up to March 2020, based on projections for 2020 (IPC November 2019).\n\nBangladesh (Cox's Bazar)\n\nThe majority of the 915 000 Rohingya refugees residing in Teknaf and Ukhiya upazilas of Cox's Bazar are expected to remain in 2020.1 The environment may become more complex, driven by factors such as evolving public opinion and decreasing social cohesion, following deteriorating security around camps in 2019, especially for women and girls. Government policy considerations and humanitarian access constraints may present further challenges - although dependence on external aid will likely continue. Without continued funds, the basic services put in place for Rohingya refugees could be at risk, with potential to endanger lives and lead to a rapid security breakdown. The impact of a cyclone would be devastating for the fragile camps and the Bangladeshi communities, in particular those on the coastline (JRP, March 2020).\n\nThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea\n\nThe geopolitical situation will likely remain volatile, with the protracted humanitarian crisis experienced by the most vulnerable unlikely to abate. Limited availability of agricultural inputs is likely to remain in 2020, ensuring that a lack of dietary diversity, acute food insecurity and malnutrition remain critical challenges. The health system faces a pressing shortage of essential medical supplies (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nIntermittent conflict and sociopolitical unrest continue to aggravate and threaten livelihoods. High levels of unemployment, perceived corruption and lack of basic services sparked widespread protests from October 2019, incurring adverse consequences for food security (WFP, January 2020). Without communal reconciliation, large-scale reconstruction, and widespread economic rejuvenation, high numbers of IDPs, returnees and host communities will remain vulnerable. The pace of closures and consolidations of IDP camps is an area of uncertainty for 2020: when families are relocated to non-camp settings, it is harder for humanitarian organizations to service their needs or track their vulnerabilities (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nRohingya refugees/Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals (FDMN) registered under the joint Government-UNHCR registration exercise as of 31 December 2019. This figure was released after completion of the JRP 2020 planning process, using a planning figure of 855 000 persons. 1\n\nLebanon\n\nLebanon is facing a macroeconomic crisis, and the ongoing political deadlock that followed the Prime Minister's resignation under pressure from anti-government protests is likely to accelerate the economic decline. The country's very high public debt is placing a strain on foreign currency reserves, leading to reduced capacity to import critical goods, such as food and fuel. The local currency depreciated by 63 percent on the informal market from October 2019-February 2020, eroding people's purchasing power (WFP, March 2020).\n\nPakistan Pakistan is experiencing its worst locust infestation since the 1990s following a drought period. The Government has declared a state of emergency and it is particularly worried about the potential impact on domestic food production to vulnerable agropastoral populations (FAO, April 2020). Nearly a decade of conflict and terrorism in 13 newly-merged districts/tribal subdivisions of Bajaur, Khyber, Kurram, Mohmand, North Waziristan, Orakzai and South Waziristan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly known as Federally Administered Tribal Agencies (FATA)) and Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, Kohat, Lakki Marwat, Peshawar and Tank (formerly known as Frontier regions), have caused major population displacements, disrupted livelihoods and severely damaged rural infrastructure and markets. Although the security situation has improved, in 2020, people are expected to continue facing difficulties in restoring their livelihoods. Their lack of purchasing power will likely be exacerbated by rising food prices as well as livestock diseases. Consequently, from June-August 2020, around 1.27 million people (25 percent of the population analysed) are expected to face Crisis or worse conditions (IPC Phase 3 or above) (IPC, April 2020).2\n\nThe political situation and other main drivers of acute food insecurity are likely to remain largely unchanged in 2020. In the absence of investment, there is growing pressure placed on coping mechanisms, thereby deepening the vulnerability of the population. In the West Bank, policies and practices affecting Area C, East Jerusalem and the Israeli-controlled part of Hebron city are expected to continue, leading to erosion of livelihoods. Economic development will remain hampered by the limitations on Palestinian access to land and natural resources, and by a multi-layered system of administrative, bureaucratic and physical constraints, including the Barrier (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nThe Syrian Arab Republic\n\nIn early 2020 the humanitarian situation in north-west Syria was deteriorating at an alarming rate, as military operations and clashes intensified across the Idleb area, including in parts of northern Hama and western Aleppo (OCHA, February 2020).\n\nPreliminary findings pending official release at country level 2\n\nBetween early December 2019 and late February 2020, more than 900 000 people were estimated to have fled their homes or shelters in Idlib for northern Idlib and Aleppo governorates, seeking refuge in increasingly crowded areas (UNHCR, February 2020). Hostilities are having a devastating impact on key civilian infrastructure, particularly health facilities across Idlib and western Aleppo governorates (OCHA, February 2020).\n\nNewly displaced people, overburdened communities, spontaneous returnees and IDPs living in sites of last resort, collective centres or in open areas are expected to remain particularly vulnerable in 2020. Food access was expected to worsen as food prices are rising (the reference food basket was 57 percent higher in February 2020 than in October 2019) and traders are unwilling to grant credit. The informal exchange rate is depreciating both in the Syrian Arab Republic and in Lebanon, further complicating the inflow of goods into the country (WFP, March 2020). Households headed by women and children, and people with disabilities will be highly vulnerable. Humanitarian access - including to conduct needs assessments - is likely to vary across the country. It continues to be severely challenged by several factors, including hostilities, administrative regulations and restrictions on staffmovements (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nThe beginning of 2020 was marked by the prospects for peace in Yemen, with the UN-backed Stockholm Agreement leading to a significant drop in violence in Hodeidah. However, conflict remains intense in several areas of the country and violence will likely continue (ACLED, January 2020). The combined effects of conflict, macroeconomic crisis, weather-related shocks and crop pests, including fall armyworm and desert locusts, are likely to lead to persisting levels of acute food insecurity in 2020 and may further increase acute malnutrition across the country. These conditions will likely ensure that Yemen remains the world's worst global food insecurity and malnutrition crisis in 2020. Should peace process efforts bring about a substantial lowering of the intensity of the conflict, this could provide some respite, but the process is likely to be protracted.\n\nThe number of acutely food-insecure people is expected to exceed 17 million, based on FEWS NET, and the risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5) persists, particularly if conflict significantly disrupts port operations (FEWS NET, February 2020).\n\nREGIONAL FORECAST FOR EUROPE\n\nUkraine (Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts)\n\nDecember 2019 marked an important turning point and potentially new forward momentum in establishing a permanent ceasefire in the Ukraine. For the first time in three years the Presidents of France, the Russian Federation and Ukraine and the Federal Chancellor of Germany met to reinvigorate the stalled\n\nUKRAINE (LUH ANSK AND DO NESK O\n\nBLAST)\n\nAFGH ANISTAN\n\nRO H IN GYA REFUGEES COX'S BAZAR, BANGLADESH\n\nIRAQ PALESTINE\n\nM YANM AR PAKISTAN, FO RM ER FATA\n\nSYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC YEM EN\n\nM ap 72 N um ber of people in IPC Phase 3 or above, drivers and risks in the M iddle East and South Asia in 2020 SYRIAN REFUGEES JO RDAN SYRIAN REFUGEES TURKEY SYRIAN REFUGEES LEBANO N Source: FSIN GRFC M arch 2020.

Other promising actions included the disengagement of forces in several areas and the exchange of prisoners. However, humanitarian needs in conflict-affected areas of Eastern Ukraine (Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts) are expected to remain severe in 2020 because of the effects of the six-year crisis on the lives, livelihoods and resilience of people. The most vulnerable are urban populations living closest to the 'contact line' (OCHA, January 2020).\n\nREGIONAL FORECAST FOR LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN Sociopolitical crises, lack of employment and high food prices are likely to lead to deteriorating acute food insecurity in some countries.\n\nColombia\n\nConditions within the Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) will likely maintain the continuous flow of people to Colombia, with an increase in their needs upon their arrival in the country. The restrictions imposed by other countries - as well as the degree of access that the Government of Colombia has offered to Venezuelans - will have an impact on the number of those in transit and with intent to stay in Colombia (R4V, January 2020).\n\nThe sociopolitical unrest that paralyzed the economy and drove up food prices in 2019 (WFP, January 2020) had stabilized by early 2020, allowing for transportation and commercial activities to resume. However, the current dysfunction of Parliament creates uncertainty, and mass protests and episodes of violence may resurface in coming months (FAO, January 2020) and further weaken the country's economy. This in turn will diminish the ability of the poorest Haitians to meet their basic needs, as well as the capacity of the State to provide essential services (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nHousehold food security therefore remains fragile, hampered by high food prices, the lack of employment opportunities and the residual effects of the sociopolitical crisis (FEWS NET, January 2020). According to the October 2019 IPC analysis, if no actions were taken to restore the food security and livelihoods of vulnerable populations, the number of people facing Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) would increase from 3.7 million in October 2019-February 2020 to 4.1 million during the March- June 2020 lean season (IPC, October 2019).\n\nVenezuelans will face continued loss of livelihoods, and negative coping strategies could become the norm for the most vulnerable (OCHA, December 2019). The crisis is likely to affect increasing numbers of people in 2020. International sanctions could deepen the economic crisis and internal political tensions may escalate domestic unrest (International Rescue Committee, January 2020).\n\nThe outflow of Venezuelans is expected to continue, making it one of the world's largest migration crises (R4V, January 2020). By the end of 2020, around 2.4 million are expected to be in Colombia and 659 000 in Ecuador (RMRP 2020). Various host countries have imposed stricter entry requirements to ease the burden on near-exhausted response capacities and to defuse growing social tensions (OCHA, December 2019).\n\nA substantial increase in those undertaking circular migration to meet basic needs is also expected, primarily between the Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) and Colombia. Other vulnerable people will include those returning from Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) to their countries of origin, people in transit and host communities. Refugees and migrants living in shelters, on the streets and recent arrivals in a host/transit country are among the most vulnerable. Overstretched national capacities, as well as the economic and political difficulties in some host countries may adversely affect the refugees and migrants (R4V, January 2020).\n\nThe Central American Dry Corridor\n\nThe 2019 drought and depressed household incomes, particularly for coffee growers, will drive acute food insecurity in the Dry Corridor.\n\nFrom February, the lack of basic grain reserves resulting from the prolonged 2019 drought and the fall in demand for casual agricultural labour - the main source of income for poor households - were expected to limit food access and signify the premature start of the lean season. The decline in international coffee prices continues to depress the incomes of coffee growers and consequently of those reliant on daily wages as coffee cutters. Households in the Dry Corridor will have limited chances to save money to buy food, pay credits and save for subsequent months (FEWS NET, January 2020).\n\nIn Honduras, the number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) is expected to increase from about 1 million in November 2019-February 2020 to 1.2 million in March-June 2020. In April-July 2020, 1.3 million people in rural Guatemala, representing 19 percent of the rural population, are expected to be in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) (IPC, December 2019). Around or less than 0.1 million people will likely face Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) conditions in both Nicaragua and El Salvador from May-August 2020 (FEWS NET, February 2020).\n\nIn 2020, migration from Central America to northern countries is expected to continue, spurred by irregular climate patterns affecting food production, and criminality/insecurity in the Dry Corridor.

In contexts of conflict where violence, insecurity and displacements are likely to increase, the nutrition situation is also expected to deteriorate due to the spread of diseases, limited access to food and basic services as well as limited access to humanitarian aid, such as in conflict areas in Burkina Faso, Mali, northern Nigeria and Yemen.\n\nA persistent, deteriorated situation is forecast for countries with political and economic crises that are not likely to improve in the coming year including Eswatini, Haiti and Zimbabwe. In countries with positive food security forecasting, such as Malawi, the nutrition situation is not likely to deteriorate.\n\nNine countries (Chad, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, the Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Uganda) affected by food crises in 2019 have conducted an IPC Acute Malnutrition analysis and produced a forecast for early 2020. The situation is expected to deteriorate in all provinces of Chad and the Niger due to the seasonal increase in malaria, diarrhoea and respiratory infections, which peak from May-September, and constitute the main driving factors of acute malnutrition in these countries.\n\nThe deteriorating situations expected in Nigeria are the result of poor child-feeding practices coupled with seasonal food shortages and increased morbidity in the areas surveyed.\n\nIn Madagascar, the acute malnutrition situation was expected to deteriorate in more than 90 percent of the 12 areas analysed as the forecast period coincides with an increased incidence of diseases associated with poor sanitation and hygiene practices.\n\nThe nutritional status in a third of the 31 districts analysed in Mozambique are expected to deteriorate in the lean season when heavy rains contribute to an increase in the number of cases of malaria and diarrhoea. Deterioration is also possible in the districts affected in 2019 by cyclones Idai and Kenneth (Cabo Delgado and Sofala).\n\nHorn of Africa, IPC Acute malnutrition projections for 2020\n\nSource: Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan and Uganda IPC Technical Working Group.
