The Somali Region remains the epicentre of the drought, with an estimated 1.8 million people in need of lifesaving food assistance.\n\n WFP is providing emergency relief assistance to the Somali Region while the Government of Ethiopia and the Joint Emergency Operation Program (JEOP), an NGO consortium provide relief assistance to the rest of the country.\n\n There is a 70-80 percent likelihood of weak La Niña conditions persisting through March 2018. As a result, drought is expected to continue to drive humanitarian needs over the next six months as five consecutive failed rainy seasons have eroded the coping capacities and livelihoods of agro-pastoralist communities in many parts of the country.\n\n There are an estimated 1.7 million IDPs in Ethiopia (IOM DTM 9, March 2018), of which, 1.14 million people were recently displaced by the renewed inter-communal conflict in the Oromia and Somali regions (since August 2017).\n\n According to FEWS.NET, recent household surveys and assessments suggest that food security outcomes remain severe in parts of the Somali Region and levels of acute malnutrition remain critically high. Outcomes are worst among IDPs, who have lost most of their livestock and will therefore have the most difficulty recovering even if future rains improve. Many IDP and resident households are facing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes.

The Somali Region remains the epicenter of the drought, with an estimated 1.8 million people in need of lifesaving food assistance.\n\n Insecurity related access constraints are becoming more of an impediment to WFP's ability to make timely deliveries as unrest grows in the country. WFP is exploring alternate routes to deliver commodities. However, some areas remain inaccessible with limited visibility on the food security and malnutrition status of households living in the areas. malnutrition and excess human mortality, particularly among children, could occur.\n\n On 16 February 2018, the Council of Ministers of the Government of Ethiopia declared a State of Emergency (SoE) for six months, to ensure security in areas where violence is prevalent. The Government and humanitarian partners are closely monitoring the impact of the ongoing unrest to ensure that humanitarian assistance is delivered to the people in need.\n\nWFP Response\n\nEmergency Relief Assistance  In February, WFP aims to reach 3.7 million people with emergency relief assistance in the Somali Region (including 1.6 million people registered under the Government's Protective Safety Net Programme (PSNP) and 300,000 conflict IDPs).\n\n WFP's emergency relief assistance in the\n\nSomali Region comprises of a combination of food and cash, depending on system readiness, nutritional needs and where markets function.\n\n WFP, through an integration HRD-PSNP cash pilot programme is delivering humanitarian transfers to 588,000 beneficiaries using the national safety net mechanism, in an effort to better harmonize the development and humanitarian investments in the Somali Region. Areas to be targeted for system strengthening will be identified as this approach is taken to scale later in the year.\n\n Distributions for rounds 7 and 8 are currently ongoing. As of 05 March 2018, WFP has dispatched at 93 percent and distributed 83 percent of the allocated 36,845 mt of food under Round 7 and; dispatched 62 percent and distributed 29 percent of the allocated 27,353 mt of food under Round 8.\n\n Insecurity along the Oromia-Somali borders remains a major constraint to WFP response and affecting dispatches and distributions particular to the Dawa Zone in the Somali Region.\n\nNutrition Interventions\n\n In February, WFP is providing curative and preventive nutrition services to an estimated 1 million children under five years of age and pregnant and nursing mothers in areas where the risk of malnutrition is the highest in Ethiopia.\n\n WFP has had to cancel delayed Targeted\n\nSupplementary Feeding entitlements for February to parts Amhara and Oromia regions where the security situation is volatile. Similarly, Blanket Supplementary Feeding dispatches to the Dawa zone in the Somali Region have been suspended because of inaccessibility. If the situation improves the entitlements will resume in March.\n\nClimate Risk Management\n\n In March 2018, WFP plans to launch SIIPE\n\n(Satellite Index Insurance for Pastoralists in Ethiopia), a pilot project that aims to reduce disaster risks and increase resilience to climate shocks through assets compensation (as insurance pay-out) for weather-related losses in the Somali Region. An estimated 5,000 pastoral households are expected to be part of the pilot during year one.\n\nSupply Chain and Logistics\n\n Insecurity related access constraints are becoming more of a challenge as unrest grows in the country. WFP is exploring alternate routes to deliver commodities. However, some areas remain inaccessible.\n\nResourcing Update Top 5 Donors in 2018  United States (US$ 57.34 million), Canada (US$ 10.36 million), Sweden (US$ 3.7 million), Germany (US$ 4.2 million), Japan (US$ 3 million).\n\nContacts  Country Director a.i.: Samir S.
