Since November, rainfall has been belowaverage in South Africa. Significant moisture deficits have strengthened and expanded into several parts of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia, Namibia, and southern Angola.\n\n2. Although rainfall has increased in some areas of Madagascar since mid-November, the negative impacts of the delayed onset of the rainfall season is still present. Rainfall is below average in several western provinces of the island.\n\n3. Below-average rain during the past month has resulted in large moisture deficits and below-average vegetation conditions in northwestern Angola. 1\n\nWeather Hazards Summary\n\nAfrica Overview\n\nDespite rain elsewhere, dryness worsens in Angola Last week, above-average rain was recorded over eastern Angola, Zambia, northern Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Mozambique. The highest 7-day rainfall totals exceeded 150mm in parts of Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique (Figure 1). As a result, localized flooding has been reported. Totals of at least 100mm were widespread in Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Mozambique. Very light rainfall was recorded from Botswana, across northern South Africa/southern Zimbabwe, into southern Mozambique. Rains remained very light in northwestern Angola, where moisture deficits are growing. In southern and western parts of Madagascar, the last few days brought the first significant rainfall in many weeks.\n\nA pattern switch has become apparent since the start of February. During January, rainfall analyses suggested that the monsoon performance was one of the poorest on record. Over the past 2 weeks, widespread rainfall has been recorded in many of these same areas. Consequently, significant changes are observed in short term anomalies. The areas of Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Mozambique which exhibit 30-day rainfall deficits greater than 100mm have shrunk dramatically (Figure 2). Impacts from this past January are still felt on the longterm moisture anomalies, as regions in Zambia, Mozambique, southern Malawi, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa are still experiencing less than 80% of their normal rainfall totals since the beginning of December. Southwestern Madagascar has been extremely dry since the beginning of the monsoon season, receiving consistently below-average rainfall. Recent heavy rain is slowly decreasing moisture deficits.\n\nVegetation health indices suggests a degradation of ground conditions in parts of Namibia, Angola, Zambia, Mozambique and Malawi. However, ground reports suggest that late-planted crops in the Maize Triangle region of South Africa are likely recovering with the increase in rainfall during late January and February.\n\nDuring the next week, western Angola, DRC, Congo, Gabon, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique are expected to receive rainfall. Total amounts reaching 100mm are possible.\n\nSource: NOAA/CPC\n\nNote: The hazards outlook map on page 1 is based on current weather/climate information and short and medium range weather forecasts (up to 1 week). It assesses their potential impact on crop and pasture conditions. Shaded polygons are added in areas where anomalous conditions have been observed. The boundaries of these polygons are only approximate at this continental scale.

The scope and location of the band of enhanced rainfall was extreme y beneficial for many areas that had experienced an extremely dry January. The highest 7-day rainfall totals exceeded 150mm in local parts of Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique (Figure 1). As a result, localized flooding has been reported. Totals of at least 100mm were widespread and encompass areas of Zimbabwe, Malawi, and other parts of Mozambique. An area receiving only very light rains stretched from Botswana, across northern South Africa/southern Zimbabwe, into southern Mozambique. Rains remained very light in northwestern Angola, where moisture deficits are growi g. In southern and western parts of Madagascar, the last few days brought the first significant rainfall in many weeks.\n\nA pattern switch has become apparent since the start of February. During January, many rainfall anomaly analyses suggested that the monsoon performance was one of the poorest on record in terms of extent and distribution. Much of southern Africa had been under the influence of a suppressed convective pattern, which resulted in a period with significantly low totals and an anomalously low rainfall frequency. Over the past 2 weeks, widespread soaking rains have been present in many of these same areas. Consequently, significant changes are ob erved in short term anomalies. The areas of Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Mozambique which exhibit 30-day rainfall deficits greater than 100mm have shrunk dramatically in spatial extent (Figure 2). Impacts from this past January are still felt on the long-term moisture anomalies, as regions in Zambia, Mozambique, southern Malawi, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa are still experiencing less than 80 percent of their normal rainfall accumulation since the beginning of December. Southwestern Madagascar has been extremely dry since the beginning of the monsoon season, receiving consistently below-average rainfall. Recent heavy rain is slowly less ning moisture deficits.\n\nThe dearth of seasonal rainfall throughout many regions in southern Africa has led to increased concerns for drought, water availability, and impacts on cropping activities. Analysis of remotely sensed vegetation health indices suggests a degradation of ground conditions in parts of Namibia, Angola, Zambia, Mozambique and Malawi. Deteriorating crop conditions were already observed in parts of South Africa, and wilting has already taken place in Zimbabwe. However, ground reports suggest that late-planted crops in the Maize Triangle region of South Africa are likely recovering with the increase in rainfall during late January and February. Analysis of trends in VHI supports the rebounding of vegetation health.\n\nDuring the outlook period, models suggest that areas expected to receive enhanced rainfall include western Angola, DRC, Congo, and Gabon, as well as, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Total amounts reaching 100mm are possible. Tanzania is likely to receive suppressed rains and a welcome reprieve to abnormally wet conditions.\n\n7-Day Satellite Estimated Rainfall (mm) Valid: February 07 - February 13, 2018\n\nFigure 1: NOAA/CPC\n\nSatellite Estimated Rainfall Anomaly (mm) Valid: January 15, 2018 - February 13, 2018\n\nFigure 2: NOAA/CPC Note: The hazards outlook map on page 1 is based on current weather/climate information and short and medium range weather forecasts (up to 1 week).

Extreme minimum temperatures ranged from near -30°C in northern Kazakhstan to near -10°C in southern Turkmenistan and western Afghanistan. Maximum temperatures are likely to average above-normal throughout the region with the largest positive anomalies (>8°C) across Afghanistan. Maximum temperatures are forecast to exceed 25°C in the lowlands of southwestern Afghanistan and southern Turkmenistan during the next week.\n\nPrecipitation Mostly dry weather returned to the region during the past week. A drought hazard remains posted for areas where the snow water equivalent anomaly is largely negative. Satellite estimates indicate that precipitation has averaged below-normal during the past 90 days, an abnormal dryness hazard is posted for the rest of Afghanistan.\n\nWidespread rain and high-elevation snow (local amounts >25mm, liquid equivalent) are expected across Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, southern areas of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, and northern Afghanistan next week. However, snow is expected to be limited to the higher elevations due to above-normal temperatures.\n\nNo hazards reported\n\nWeather Hazards Summary Central America and the Caribbean Overview\n\nSeasonal conditions continue in Central America\n\nLast week, limited rainfall was recorded over much of Central America, continuing seasonal conditions over the region. Much of the interior recorded no rainfall; while northern Guatemala and portions of Belize received moderate to heavy rains. An analysis of the accumulated rainfall since early January to date has indicated neutral anomalies across the inland of Central America and positive rainfall anomalies over northern Guatemala, Belize, the Atlantic coastlines of Honduras, eastern Nicaragua, and eastern Costa Rica. Recent vegetation indices indicate positive conditions throughout much of Central America. Although the average performance of the December-April rainfall season has benefited winter cropping season activities over many areas, dry soils that are associated with the typical lack of rainfall during this time of the year have also increased threats for forest fires.\n\nFor next week, dry weather conditions are once again expected over Central America. However, light rains are possible over northern Guatemala, Belize, and along the Atlantic coastlines of Honduras and Nicaragua. Minimum temperature is expected to be average and remain above the freezing point.\n\nSeasonable weather expected in Hispaniola next week Last week, little rainfall fell over Hispaniola. Over the past four weeks, neutral rainfall anomalies were registered throughout Hispaniola, except portions of central Haiti, where small positive anomalies were recorded. Consequently, vegetation conditions were average across much of the island. During the next week, Hispaniola is expected to be mostly dry.\n\nABOUT WEATHER HAZARDS Hazard maps are based on current weather/climate information, short and medium range weather forecasts (up to 1 week) and their potential impact on crop and pasture conditions. Shaded polygons are added in areas where anomalous conditions have been observed. The boundaries of these polygons are only approximate at this continental scale.

During the past seven days, suppressed rains were observed over much of Central America, continuing dry but seasonally marginal conditions over the region during the past several weeks. Much of the interior of the region recorded no rainfall; while northern Guatemala and portions of Belize received moderate to heavy rains, based on satellite-derived rainfall estimates. An analysis of the accumulated rainfall since early January to date has indicated neutral anomalies across the inland of Central America and positive rainfall anomalies over northern Guatemala, Belize, the Atlantic coastlines of Honduras, eastern Nicaragua, and eastern Costa Rica. As a result, the most recent vegetation indices have exhibited adequate to positive conditions throughout much of Central Americ . Although the near to above-average performance of the December-April rainfall season has benefited winter cropping s ason activities over many areas, dry soils that are associated with the typical lack of rainfall during this time of the year, have also increased threats for forest fires over many local areas. For next week, dry weather onditions, with mostly suppressed rains, are once a ain expected over C ntral America. However, enhanced, light to moderate rains are possible ov r northern Guatemala, Belize, and along the Atlantic co tlines of Honduras nd Nic ragua. Meanwhile as far as temperatures are concerned, despite the forecast passage of a frontal system to the north during early period, minimum temperature is expected to average near climatology and remain above the freezing point, which still could negatively impact crops and the livelihoods of residents over elevated terrains during nigh ti e and rly morning.\n\nWeek 1 Rainfall Total Forecast
