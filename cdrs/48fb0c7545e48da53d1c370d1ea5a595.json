Due to poor rainfall since November western Namibia is in a severe drought. Conditions may worsen as limited rain is forecast next week.\n\n2. In southwestern Madagascar, an uneven and inadequate rainfall distribution since the start of the rainfall season has resulted in severe drought. Drought conditions are likely to persist.\n\n3. In northwestern Angola, little to no rainfall is forecast next week, which could increase moisture deficits and worsen conditions on the ground.\n\n4. Rain last week caused flooding, damage and fatalities in Kenya. Additional rain is forecast next week.\n\n1 2\n\nWeather Hazards Summary\n\nAfrica Overview\n\nHeavy rain recorded in Kenya and northeastern Madagascar During the past week, Tropical storm Eliakim made landfall in northeastern Madagascar. Rainfall totals in excess of 200mm were recorded over northeastern Madagascar (Figure 1). In Southern Africa, areas that received heavy rain included southern Angola, southern DRC, northern Zambia, Tanzania, Lesotho, and eastern South Africa. In contrast, limited rainfall was recorded over northwestern Angola, Botswana, Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, southern Mozambique, and southern Madagascar.\n\nOver the Greater Horn of Africa, heavy rain also resulted in flooding in Kenya, including the Nairobi area, the southwest, and southeast regions. Rain was also recorded over Uganda and much of Tanzania. To the north, light rain was recorded over southern and central Ethiopia. While many southern areas of Eastern Africa received above-average rain during the past week, some local areas of central Ethiopia continued to remain dry.\n\nMoisture deficits continue in Angola and southern Madagascar\n\nThirty- day negative rainfall anomalies have increased across western Angola and southern Madagascar, with deficits exceeding 100 mm over some areas (Figure 2). Deficits also persisted over northeastern Mozambique, southern Botswana, western and north-central South Africa. Meanwhile, positive rainfall anomalies were registered throughout southeastern Angola, Zambia, northeastern Botswana, Zimbabwe, northern Malawi, southern Mozambique, and northeastern Madagascar. Vegetation conditions are poor and below-average across Southern Africa.\n\nFor next week, wet weather conditions, with moderate to heavy rain is forecast southern Ethiopia, including the Ogaden region, southwestern and central Kenya. Widespread, light rain is expected over southern and central Somalia. Farther south, moderate rain is forecast from Angola, Zambia, Botswana, western Zimbabwe, to eastern South Africa. The forecast rain could trigger flash flood over local areas of east-central South Africa. In contrast, limited rain is expected over southern Mozambique and the inland of Madagascar.\n\nSource: NOAA/CPC\n\nNote: The hazards outlook map on page 1 is based on current weather/climate information and short and medium range weather forecasts (up to 1 week).

Satellite rainfall estimates indicated high rainfall totals in excess of 200 mm over northeastern Madagascar (Figure 1). Over Southern Africa, areas that received moderate to heavy rain included southern Angola, outhern DRC, northern Zambia, Tanzania, Lesotho, and eastern South Africa. In contrast, limited and suppressed rain was recorded over northwestern Angola, Botswana, Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, southern Mozambique, and southern Madagascar.\n\nFarther north, over the Greater Horn of Africa, widespread heavy rain also resulted in flooding, overflowing of rivers, fatalities, damaged infrastructures, and affected people over many parts of Kenya, including the Nairobi area, the southwest and southeast regions, based on media reports. He y rain was also recorded over Uganda and much of Tanzania. To the north, light to moderate rain was recorded over southern and central Ethiopia. While many southern areas of Eastern Africa received aboveaverage rain during the past week, some local areas of central Ethiopia continued to receive insufficient rain.\n\nMoisture deficits strengthened ver western Angola and southern Madagascar.\n\nDue to this past week's limited and below- verage rain, thirtyday neg tive rainfall anomalies have increased across western Angola and southern Madagascar, with deficits exceeding 100 mm over some areas (Figure 2). Thirty-day rainfall deficits also persisted over northeastern Mozambique, southern Botswana, western and north-central South Africa. Meanwhile, positive rainfall anomalies were registered throughout southeastern Angola, Zambia, northeastern Botswana, Zimbabwe, northern Malawi, southern Mozambique, and northeastern Madagascar.\n\nAn analysis of recent vegetation conditions, inferred from remote sensing techniques, indicat d that poor and below-average conditions persisted over many local areas of South rn Africa, including southwestern Angola, western Namibia, the northern and western portions of South Africa, and southwestern Madagascar.\n\nFor next week, wet weather conditions, with scattered moderate to heavy rain is forecast southern Ethiopia, including the Ogaden region, southwestern and central Kenya, which maintains the risks for flooding over saturated and previously-flooded areas of the country. Widespread, light rain is expected over southern and central Somalia and is expected to help cropping activities in the region. Farther south, widespread, moderate to heavy rain is forecast from Angola, Zambia, Botswana, western Zimbabwe, to eastern South Africa. The forecast abundant rain could trigger flash flood over local areas of east-central South Africa. In contrast, limited rain is expected over southern Mozambique and the inland of Madagascar.\n\n7-Day Satellite Estimated Rainfall (mm) Valid: March 14 - March 20, 2018\n\nFigure 1: NOAA/CPC\n\nSatellite Estimated Rainfall Anomaly (mm) Valid: February 19 - March 20, 2018\n\nFigure 2: NOAA/CPC Torrential rain wreaked havoc over Kenya and northeas ern M d ga car.\n\nDuring the past week, Tropical storm Eliakim made landfall in northeastern Madagascar, leaving fatalities, flooding, destroyed infrastructures, and affected pe ple over the northern and east rn parts of the I land, according to reports.

Meanwhile, parts of western Kazakhstan experienced cooler than average conditions. Maximum temperatures exceeding 25-30°C were recorded in Pakistan and southern Afghanistan. Next week, a warmer air mass will surge northward through Central Asia. Maximum temperatures may be more than 12°C above normal in many central portions of the region. Highs as much as 25°C may be observed as far north as southern Kazakhstan.\n\nPrecipitation Moderate (10-50mm liquid equivalent) precipitation was recorded in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and eastern Uzbekistan last week. With greater than 100mm recorded in northern Pakistan. Light snow was scattered over eastern and northern Kazakhstan. Significant rains in some dry areas of Central Asia continue to bring slow improvement; however, low snow water equivalent and large ninety-day precipitation deficits continue to persist over many portions of Central Asia.\n\nNext week, scattered precipitation will be prevalent across much of Kazakhstan. With light precipitation (5-25mm liquid equivalent) in eastern Afghanistan and Tajikistan.\n\nNo hazards reported\n\nWeather Hazards Summary Central America and the Caribbean Overview\n\nCentral America remains dry\n\nModerate rains were recorded across parts of northern Honduras and Belize, however, Guatemala remained dry. Despite the lack of rainfall during mid-March, monthly moisture deficits remain minimal, as several departments continue to register near-normal conditions towards the end of the Apante season. Analysis of seasonal moisture anomalies since last December suggest the performance of the Apante season has been generally favorable. Vegetation health is average. However, drier weather and low soil moisture conditions maintains an elevated risk for forest fires over many local areas.\n\nDuring the next week, an increase in rainfall is again forecast mainly across the Gulf of Honduras region with the potential for locally heavy rainfall accumulations (>50mm) over northern Guatemala and northern Honduras. Additionally, increased rainfall is also forecast for portions of eastern Nicaragua and Costa Rica.\n\nIncreased rainfall forecast for eastern Hispaniola next week Light rainfall was recorded over most of Hispaniola. Weekly totals greater than 100mm were registered in the Puerto Plata region of northern Dominican Republic, with little to no rainfall observed elsewhere in the country. Since mid-February, rainfall continues to range between average to above-average, with short-term moisture surpluses concentrated over the eastern Dominican Republic and southern Haiti. Ground conditions are favorable.\n\nNext week, locally heavy rainfall (>50mm) is expected for parts of Dominican Republic and southern Haiti.\n\nABOUT WEATHER HAZARDS Hazard maps are based on current weather/climate information, short and medium range weather forecasts (up to 1 week) and their potential impact on crop and pasture conditions. Shaded polygons are added in areas where anomalous conditions have been observed. The boundaries of these polygons are only approximate at this continental scale.

Following an above-average rainfall forecast last week over northern Central America, locally moderate rains were received across parts of northern Honduras and Belize, however, several other areas in Guatemala remained dry. Despite the lack of rainfall during mid-March, monthly moisture deficits remain minimal, as several departments continue to register near-normal conditions towards the end of the Apante season. Analysis of seasonal moisture anomalies since last December suggest the performance of the Apante season has been generally favorable, with many regions experiencing average to above-average rainfall conditions due to periods of enhanced rainfall during January and early February. Remotely sensed vegetation health indices also indicate satisfactory ground conditions, with little evidence of degradation despite the seasonably dry conditions during February and March. However, drier weather and low soil moisture conditions still maintains an elevated risk for forest fires over many local areas. During the next week, an increase in rainfall is again forecast mainly across the Gulf of Honduras region with the potential for locally heavy rainfall accumulations (>50mm) over northern Guatemala and northern Honduras. Additionally, increased precipitation is also forecast for portions of eastern Nicaragua and Costa Rica.\n\nWeek 1 Rainfall Total Forecast and CMORPH climatology (mm) March 21 - March 28,
