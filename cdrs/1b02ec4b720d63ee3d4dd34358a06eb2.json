WFP/Michale Tewelde\n\nSituation Update\n\n The food security situation in the southern belt of Ethiopia continues to deteriorate, and the number of people in need of relief assistance has increased from 5.6 million to 7.8 million. The additional 2.2 million people live in Amhara, Oromia and Southern Nations Nationalities and People's Region (SNNPR), where the current Belg (short rainy season) has performed poorly. A formal assessment, led by the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) will be launched in June to determine the overall needs for the second half of 2017.\n\n Poor livestock body condition and lack of milk on the markets, coupled with unfavourable livestock-to-cereal prices, have led to increased use of negative coping mechanisms among pastoralists. In pastoral areas of Oromia, distress sales of livestock have reportedly decreased prices by up to 75 percent on average compared to the normal season.\n\n The number of acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) cases continues to rise. WHO reported about 29,000 AWD cases in the country since 2017, of which 90 percent are in the Somali Region. The situation could potentially increase the caseload for nutritional response even further and impact the overall humanitarian response.\n\n After weeks of delayed Belg, Oromia and SNNP regions received scattered rain showers in the last part of March and in April. Nevertheless, the distribution of rains was insufficient to positively impact pasture and water availability. Below average spring rains in the\n\n6-Month Net Funding Requirements\n\n(May - October 2017)\n\nWFP-GoE: Relief (HRD)\n\nWFP: TSFP\n\nWFP: PSNP\n\nWFP: Refugees USD 345.8 million USD 37.5 million USD 5.2 million USD 17.6 million\n\nPeople reached with relief assistance by the joint WFP-GoE response\n\n51% 49%\n\nMarch and April 2017\n\nIn Numbers 7.8 million people in need of relief food assistance, inclusive of an additional 2.2 million people from Amhara, Oromia and SNNPR.\n\n2.7 million children, and pregnant and nursing mothers in need of specialized nutritious food to treat moderate acute malnutrition. Of this number, 1.3 million live in Nutrition Hotspot Priority 1 woredas (districts).\n\nWFP Ethiopia 2017 Emergency Situation Report #2\n\nHighlights\n\n As a result of significant funding shortfalls, WFP-GoE only has food up to the end of June. Even if new resources should materialize now, the food will only arrive in the country by August/September.\n\n It is expected that the HRD relief and MAM caseload will be revised upwards after the Belg assessment in May/June due to failed Belg rains and the overall deteriorating situation.\n\n In April, Ethiopia saw an influx of refugees from South Sudan, accounting for 33,547 of the 49,231 refugees who arrived in the country 2017.\n\nHRD-Food Cluster (Relief) Response Coverage 2017\n\nRound 1: 4.5 million Round 2: 4.2 million Both rounds were based on the initial 5.6 million HRD target population, of which the WFP-GoE share was about 4.7 million.\n\nPage | 2 WFP Ethiopia Emergency Situation Report #2 March and April 2017\n\nBelg-receiving areas will prolong the already growing emergency response beyond September and may lead to increased needs.\n\n For operational preparedness, as well as to alert donors of an increase in funding requirements, the UN and the GoE have developed a most-likely-scenario paper projecting the number of people to increase further from the current 7.8 million caseload.\n\nWFP Response\n\n In the first quarter of 2017, insecurities at the\n\nOromia-Somali border, reported looting, and attacks delayed delivery of humanitarian assistance to the Somali Region. To minimize risks, WFP liaised with the Ethiopian Defence Force for cross-border escort where necessary, and limited cross-border transport as much as possible by dispatching from Gode hub to the south-eastern provinces of the Somali Region.\n\nFood and Nutrition Assistance\n\nRelief Assistance\n\n WFP experienced delays during food distributions in Rounds 1 and 2, which commenced on 24 January and 06 March, respectively, due to insecurity and prolonged discussions with the Somali Regional Government over the total number of food distribution points (FDPs). Nevertheless, WFP completed distributing food to the Somali Region, reaching 1.3 million people (including 50,000 IDPs) in Round 1 and 1.7 million people in Round 2.\n\n Distribution and post-distribution monitoring exercises indicate that the needs in the Somali Region far outstrip the official targeted numbers. As a result, more people have received WFP assistance, but the quantity received is significantly below the international threshold of 2,100kcal per person per day.\n\n For the ongoing Round 3, WFP has adjusted its initial plan to support 1 million beneficiaries in the Somali Region and is now reaching the full 1.7 million target population. This will have significant implications for future rounds as current food stocks will not be sufficient to ensure the same level of support in Rounds 4 and 5. WFP is projecting that all existing food stocks will be depleted by the end of June 2017. If resources are not made available before the end of May, WFP will have no food whatsoever to distribute in the Somali Region, leaving the full 1.7 million people extremely vulnerable.\n\n According to IOM, 61 IDP sites in the Somali Region, representing 79,000 individuals, reported no access to food. WFP is working with the Somali Regional Government to\n\nWoredas: Raso, TarmaBer, Daratole, Danot, Girar Jarso, Dera, Mirab Imi, Imiberi, Birkot, Efrata Gidim, Warder, Antsokia Gemza, Mubarak, Udet, Chereti, Kubi, Hamero, Anfilo,Diga, Sasiga 1 incorporate these IDP sites in the forthcoming distribution rounds.\n\nNutrition\n\n After months of delay, new screenings took place in the Somali and SNNP regions in March, better capturing the current Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) situation. In the Somali Region, the results showed that out of 99 woredas where screenings were conducted, 32 percent of the woredas registered Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) rates ranging from 10-20 percent, and 9 percent of the woredas presented MAM rates above 20 percent. These findings are well above the emergency thresholds and indicate the need to scale up the MAM response to stabilise the situation.\n\n To address the high prevalence of malnutrition and gap in coverage, WFP developed a regional response plan with five response modalities: (1) Blanket Supplementary Feeding, with Super Cereal Plus (SCB+) to be included in the relief rations for 35 percent of the beneficiaries (128,809 relief beneficiaries) in 12 woredas1; (2) distribution of Targeted Supplementary Feeding (TSF) commodities to beneficiaries supported by the Mobile Health and Nutrition Teams (MHNT); (3) implementation though NGOs, linking MAM to treatment of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM); (4) Temporary Treatment Centres providing integrated health and nutrition services run by UNICEF; and (5) Static Health Clinics run by the Government.\n\n The current July-December 2017 resource requirements to cover 2.7 million children and women is USD63 million. Slightly over 10 percent of this requirement has been resourced to date, with existing stocks of specialized nutritious foods projected to be fully depleted by July 2017.\n\n Some USD55 million are needed to ensure a strong MAM response and to avert a serious rise in SAM before the traditional lean season in Ethiopia. Of this total shortfall, USD30 million is needed immediately to ensure that specialized nutritious foods are procured and prepositioned across the country and ready for distribution during the most critical period covering July-September 2017. If resources are not provided in a timely manner, the risk of mortality among young children will rise significantly.\n\nRefugees\n\n WFP continues to assist refugees from Eritrea, Somalia and South Sudan. So far\n\nPage | 3 WFP Ethiopia Emergency Situation Report #2 March and April 2017 this year, some 5,000 refugees from Somalia have arrived in Dollo Ado. Due to the establishment of IDP camps on the Somalia side of the border, the average number of new arrivals has declined from 120 a day in January 2017 to 10 by the end of April.\n\n The nutritional status of the new Somali arrivals has shown improvement, from a GAM rate of 95 percent in children under five in January to 31 percent in late April. Nevertheless, the rate remains persistently above the emergency threshold (15 percent).\n\n In Gambella, in the months of March and April, Ethiopia saw a sharp rise in the influx of refugees from South Sudan. Out of the 49,231 refugees who arrived in the country in 2017, 33,547 are from South Sudan. As the refugee camps in Gambella have already reached the limit to their capacity, the Government has opened a new camp in the neighboring Benishangul Gumus Region, and reallocations for new arrivals have started in May. WFP distributes High-Energy Biscuits (HEBs) for two overnights and the three first days in the new camp. WFP has also provided technical support erecting Mobile Storage Units, to be used as shelters, for the stations on the way to the refugee camp.\n\n By August, the refugee situation is bound to deteriorate, and shortfalls will increase to 50 percent for all commodities and cash, leading to a pipeline break in September. WFP aims to continue providing support to refugees in Ethiopia and to do so, it will have to implement further ration cuts, which will be complemented by the intensified use of cash transfers. The milling allowance and sugar have already been removed from the food basket in most camps.\n\nProductive Safety Net Programme (PSNP)\n\n In March and April, in-kind transfers of cereals and pulses were planned to reach 199,409 beneficiaries each month. However, delays in food dispatch resulted in serious delays in distribution, and were further exacerbated since woreda officials would wait to receive both commodity types before beginning any distribution. In addition, woreda officials would also wait to receive all in-kind consignments for each FDP in a given woreda before distribution to avoid complaints from beneficiaries.\n\nClusters and Common Services\n\nLogistics Cluster\n\n As of 31 March, the Logistics Cluster in Ethiopia has been deactivated. The Logistics Cluster Special Operation was originally activated in March 2016 at the request of the Government, under the leadership of WFP. It provided technical and operational support to NDRMC, which had to spearhead the emergency response to the 2015/2016 El Niño drought.\n\n WFP will continue to strengthen the logistics response in Ethiopia through: (1) augmentation of the National Humanitarian Emergency Logistics Preparedness in Ethiopia to respond to recurrent drought emergencies and other shocks; (2) support to the Ethiopian Maritime Affairs Authorities (EMAA) to continue to reduce port congestion, and facilitate joint community procurement for importers; (3) strengthening the commercial road transport sector, in close cooperation with the Federal Road Transport Authorities and; (4) the Food Management Improvement Project.\n\nUN Humanitarian Air Service\n\n To support the ongoing AWD response in the Somali Region, UNHAS has increased the frequency of flights to Dollo Ado, from two to three times per week. Moreover, assessments are ongoing in Geladi, at the epicenter of the AWD outbreak, to open a new route between Addis and Geladi. Once opened, the route will be used to transport NFIs, AWD testing samples and drugs.\n\nResourcing Update\n\nTop Five Donors in 2017\n\n USA (USD 28 million), ECHO (USD 11.8 million), Germany (USD
