The report also points the way towards solutions that can rebuild lives and livelihoods in communities around the world. Climate-induced disasters, economic crises and, above all, armed conflict, continued to drive hunger rates and food insecurity in 2018. Last May, the United Nations Security Council condemned the use of starvation as a weapon of war. Determined action is needed to uphold this pledge. In this spirit, I welcome your efforts to focus on food and agriculture in times of crisis. Let us all commit to building societies without hunger - and a world at peace.\n\nAntónio Guterres,\n\nSecretary-General of the United Nations\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9iv a c r o n y m s\n\n''I can describe the horrors of what it was like to live under siege... but to describe how it feels to be hungry?

assistance (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) in 2018.\n\nThe worst food crises in 2018, in order of severity, were: Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, the Syrian Arab Republic, the Sudan, South Sudan and north Nigeria. These eight countries accounted for two thirds of the total number of people facing acute food insecurity - amounting to nearly 72 million people.\n\nCountries in Africa remained disproportionally affected by food insecurity The figure of 113 million people represents a slight improvement over the number for 2017 presented in last year's report, in which an estimated 124 million people in 51 countries faced acute hunger.\n\nDespite the slight decrease, over the past three years, the report has consistently shown that, year on year, more than 100 million people (2016, 2017 and 2018) have faced periods of acute hunger.\n\nThe modest decrease between 2017 and 2018 is largely attributed to changes in climate shocks. A number of highly exposed countries did not experience the intensity of climate-related shocks and stressors that they had experienced in 2017 when they variously faced severe drought, flooding, erratic rains and temperature rises brought on by the El Niño of 2015-16. These include countries in southern and eastern Africa, the Horn of Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the AsiaPacific region.\n\nAn additional 143 million people in a subset of 42 countries were found to be living in Stressed conditions on the cusp of acute hunger (IPC/CH Phase 2). They risked slipping into Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) if faced with a shock or stressor.\n\nHigh levels of acute and chronic malnutrition in children living in emergency conditions remained of grave concern. The immediate drivers of undernutrition include poor dietary intake and disease. Mothers and caregivers often face challenges in providing children with the key micronutrients they need at critical growth periods in food crises. This is reflected in the dismally low number of children consuming a minimum acceptable diet in most of the countries profiled in this report.\n\nPrimary drivers\n\nConflict and insecurity, climate shocks and economic turbulence - the main drivers of food insecurity - continued to erode livelihoods and destroy lives.\n\nConflict and insecurity remained the key driver in 2018. Some 74 million people - two thirds of those facing acute hunger - were located in 21 countries and territories affected by conflict or insecurity. Around 33 million of these people were in 10 countries in Africa; over 27 million were in seven countries and territories in West Asia/Middle East; 13 million were in three countries in South/South-east Asia and 1.1 million in Eastern Europe.\n\nClimate and natural disasters pushed another 29 million people into situations of acute food insecurity in 2018. As in previous years, most of these individuals were in Africa, where nearly 23 million people in 20 countries were acutely food insecure primarily due to climate shocks.\n\nEconomic shocks were the primary driver of acute food insecurity for 10.2 million people, mainly in Burundi, the Sudan and Zimbabwe.\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 3\n\nFood insecurity: short-term outlook for 2019 Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, the Syrian Arab Republic, the Sudan, South Sudan and north Nigeria are expected to remain among the world's most severe food crises in 2019. Large segments of populations in most of these countries risk falling into Emergency (IPC/CH Phase 4) levels of acute food insecurity.\n\nClimate shocks and conflict will continue driving food insecurity and are expected once again to severely affect several regions. Dry weather in parts of southern Africa and drought in Central America's Dry Corridor have dampened prospects for agricultural output. El Niño conditions are likely to have an impact on agricultural production and food prices in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nThe needs of refugees and migrants in host countries are expected to remain significant in Bangladesh and the Syrian regional crisis. The number of displaced people, refugees and migrants are expected to increase if the political and economic crisis persists in Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).\n\nThe way forward\n\nEnding conflicts, empowering women, nourishing and educating children, improving rural infrastructure and reinforcing social safety-nets are essential for a resilient, stable and hunger-free world.\n\nInformation and technology can capture changes in food security - especially in fragile countries and contexts - on a near real-time basis. Though this report demonstrates that overall, quality of data has improved, there are countries for which there are data gaps. Collecting and analysing data on vulnerable populations is vital to ensure a situation analysis that identifies not only outcomes, but hunger's key drivers, for a targeted and integrated response for multiple partners working in development and humanitarian spheres.\n\nIn the last 10 years, humanitarian assistance and spending needs have grown by around 127 percent - approximately 40 percent of which went to cover needs in the food and agriculture subsectors. The surge in humanitarian needs - as well as the potential for agricultural development and rural resilience-building to provide a buffer against crises - highlights the need for a new way of responding to the food security challenges of this new era.\n\nInvestments in conflict prevention and sustaining peace will save lives and livelihoods, reduce structural vulnerabilities and address the root causes of hunger. The findings of this report clearly demonstrate the need for simultaneous action across the humanitarian- development nexus to deliver a hunger-free world in the 21st century. TWO GLOBAL HUNGER REPORTS\n\nThis report complements the evidence reported by The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018 (ex SOFI), which identifies 821 million undernourished people. While the SOFI estimate provides the scale of chronic food insecurity worldwide, the Global Report on Food Crises focuses specifically on the most severe manifestations of acute food insecurity in the world's most pressing food crises. i n t r o d u c t i o n a n d m e t h o d s\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 94\n\nFP /K\n\nA R\n\nEL P\n\nR IN\n\nSL O INTRODUCTION AND METHODS 1.\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 5\n\nGLOBAL NETWORK AGAINST FOOD CRISES\n\nThe Global Network Against Food Crises was launched at the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit by the European Union, FAO and WFP with the objective of tackling the root causes of food crises through shared analysis and knowledge and strengthened coordination in evidence-based responses across the humanitarian development nexus.\n\nThe Global Network acknowledges the centrality of food and agri-food systems in preventing food crises and mitigating their impact, boosting recovery and reconstruction. It also acknowledges the need to understand links and coordinate policies and actions in relation to other complex dynamics and drivers of vulnerability, such as conflict and insecurity, climate change and demography.\n\nIt is a global platform that aims to shape food security and nutrition decision-making by establishing and consolidating partnerships at national, regional and global levels; sharing data and analyses; defining innovative approaches; monitoring progress towards better food security, pursuing evidence-based advocacy and coordination for supporting food and nutrition security in contexts at risk of food crises within a longer perspective of eradicating hunger and malnutrition by 2030.\n\nThese objectives are achieved via three work streams (i) analysis and information, (ii) strategic programming and (iii) high-level policy uptake, advocacy and coordination. The work stream on analysis is delivered by the Technical Working Group under the Food Security Information Network (FSIN), which produces the annual GRFC, the main information product of the GNAFC.\n\nWHY THIS REPORT?\n\nFor several years the number of people who cannot meet their daily food needs without humanitarian assistance has been rising, primarily driven by two factors: persistent instability in conflict-ridden regions and adverse climate events.1\n\nThese growing needs have been reflected in the increasing level of international humanitarian assistance, which reached US$27.3 billion in 2017, up from US$18.4 billion in 2013.2 While critical to saving lives and alleviating human suffering, humanitarian assistance does not address the root causes of food crises.\n\nIn response, those coordinating emergency humanitarian assistance are working more seriously with those in development support and conflict prevention to find ways to reverse the current trend in escalating numbers of food-insecure people in need of urgent action.\n\nThis \"new way of working,\" aims to address the humanitarian-development (HD) nexus, which emerged from the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016, as well as the Agenda for Humanity's call3 to \"move from delivering aid to ending need,\" which provided a framework for thinking about innovative approaches to address food crises more sustainably in line with Sustainable Development Goal 2.1.4\n\nThese collaborative efforts to prevent and address food crises are reflected in the UN Security Council's adoption of resolution 2417 in May 2018. It allows the Council to consider its full range of tools - including sanctions - to ensure that parties to conflict do not violate international humanitarian law (IHL) by, for example, starving civilians as a weapon of war, unlawfully denying humanitarian access to civilian populations in need and depriving people of their means to produce food.\n\nThis HD nexus is also reflected in the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC), which seeks to combat food crises from humanitarian and development perspectives and tackle the root causes of these crises (see box). This Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) contributes to humanitarian development FSIN.

This information supports humanitarian and development actors to plan and fund evidence-based responses, while using the data to seek high-level political action for durable solutions to food crises.\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 96\n\nSTRUCTURE OF THE REPORT\n\nFor the 2019 edition of the GRFC, 15 agencies in the international humanitarian and development community have joined forces to share their data, analyses, knowledge and expertise regarding food insecurity and malnutrition in countries facing crisis.5\n\nThe report is structured as follows:\n\nChapter 1 introduces the rationale of the report, its geographical coverage and describes the methodology.\n\nChapter 2 provides an overview of 2018 food crises. A table of 53 countries and territories with food crises gives the peak 2018 numbers of food-insecure people in need of urgent action as well as the numbers of those in need of longer-term support, such as disaster risk reduction, livelihood protection and resilience-building interventions, to prevent them from becoming affected by most severe forms of acute food insecurity. It identifies the key drivers and factors contributing to food crises throughout the year, making comparisons with past editions. It also provides an overview of the nutritional status of the population in crises.\n\nChapter 3 presents country-by-country analysis of food insecurity and malnutrition for 27 selected crises. Each brief contains a narrative on the magnitude, severity and main drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition, preceded by a one-page graphical summary.\n\nChapter 4 provides an analysis of expected trends in 2019. It identifies which countries are likely to experience improving food security and those where the situation is likely to remain static or deteriorate. It explores the reasons behind the particular food insecurity forecasts, and it estimates the number of people in need of urgent action.\n\nGEOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE\n\nSelection of countries for the GRFC 2019\n\nThe main table in chapter 2 of the GRFC 2019 provides acute food insecurity data for 53 countries. The following criteria were used to select these countries.\n\nFirstly, the GRFC includes the 40 countries that required external assistance for food in 2018 as assessed by FAO Global Information and Early Warning System\n\nGRFC partners in 2019 edition: CILSS, European Union, global Food Security Cluster, global Nutrition Cluster, IFPRI, IGAD, IPC Global support unit, FAO, FEWS NET, SADC, SICA, OCHA, UNICEF, USAID, WFP 5\n\n(GIEWS). These are countries facing food crises and in need of external food assistance because they have an exceptional shortfall in aggregate food production and supplies or widespread lack of access to food or severe localized food insecurity. Eight countries not in the 2018 GIEWS list are included because they experienced at least one food crisis in the past three years or at least three food crises in the past 10 years. This ensures countries with persistent or protracted crises are captured. Thirty-four countries did not meet these criteria but were affected by natural disasters and/or hosted large numbers of refugees and/or were experiencing conflict and/or political instability and were therefore added. Among these 34 countries, 16 countries were omitted because the shock did not have a major impact on food security or the Government could handle the response without external assistance. A further 13 were excluded because of lack of data, leaving 53 countries to be analysed. See Figure 1. In this report, the shocks identified as primary drivers of acute food insecurity are categorized as follows:\n\nConflict/insecurity: countries facing conflict, insecurity, localized violence or political crisis;\n\nClimate shocks and natural disasters: climate-related and natural disasters such as drought/dry spells, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes;\n\nEconomic shocks: refers to macro or micro-economic shocks such as hyperinflation, economic down turn or significant decrease in purchasing power.\n\nShortlisting countries for further analysis\n\nThe list of 53 countries or territories facing food crises was distilled down to the 27 with the most severe food and nutrition crises for further analysis in chapter 3, using criteria based on Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) and Cadre Harmonisé (CH). They are areas with at least 20 percent of the population or at least 1 million people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) or with any area in Emergency (IPC/CH Phase 4). In the absence of IPC or CH analyses, other sources were used. (See section below for description of IPC/ CH classifications and other acute food insecurity data sources).\n\nThree countries (the Syrian Arab Republic, Yemen, The Democratic Republic of the Congo) were included because they were on the IASC Humanitarian SystemWide Emergency Response ('Level 3/L3' Response) emergencies list.6 An L3 response is activated when These countries were not only IASC L3 emergencies but they also fulfilled the first set of criteria. 6 countries + 66 countries* 205 additional countries that: 18\n\n• hosted displaced populations\n\n• faced natural hazards/climate shocks • faced conflict/political crises and insecurity NB. 16 of the 34 countries who met the criteria above were excluded because the shock(s) had little impact on food security and/or their governments requested no external assistance.\n\n=\n\n*Source: UN DESA Statistics Division, M49 Standard list of countries or areas.\n\nSTEP 1 IDENTIFY THE LONG LIST OF COUNTRIES FOR INCLUSION IN GRFC 2019 crises 27\n\nChapter 3 Analysis of food crises in 2018 The following criteria were used to select 27 crises for in-depth analysis:*\n\n• at least 20% of the population analysed in IPC/CH Phase 3 or above • at least 1 million people in IPC/CH Phase 3 or above • any area in IPC/CH Phase 4 or above • included in the IASC Humanitarian System-Wide Emergency Response - Level 3 * selection criteria not mutually-exclusive.\n\nChapter 4 Forecast of food crises in 2019 Some level of information is provided for all 66 countries, plus 2 additional countries flagged by Early Warning. • actual estimates are provided for 35 countries. 35 countries\n\nSTEP 2 DETERMINE SHORTLISTS OF COUNTRIES FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS IN GRFC 2019\n\nChapter 2 Overview of food crises in 2018 Estimates of acutely food-insecure population were produced for 53 countries.

scale, complexity, urgency, capacity and reputational risk-it is clear that the capacity to lead, coordinate and deliver humanitarian assistance and protection on the ground does not match the scale, complexity and urgency of the crisis. Declaration of an L3 response activates a UN system-wide mobilisation of leadership, staffing and funding to enable the accelerated and scaled-up delivery of assistance and protection to people in need.\n\nANALYSIS OF ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY\n\nFood insecurity refers to the lack of secure access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food for normal growth and development and an active and healthy life. For people to be food secure, food must consistently be available and accessible in sufficient quantities and diversity and households must be able to utilise (store, cook, prepare and share) the food in a way that has a positive nutritional impact.\n\nAcute food insecurity is any manifestation of food insecurity found in a specified area at a specific point in time of a severity that threatens lives or livelihoods, or both, regardless of the causes, context or duration. These acute states are highly susceptible to change and can occur and manifest in a population within a short amount of time, as a result of sudden changes or shocks that negatively impact on the determinants of food insecurity and malnutrition.7\n\nSources for the 2018 peak number of food-insecure people\n\nWhen more than one food insecurity figure exists for 2018, the GRFC presents the highest number - or peak - of food-insecure people who needed urgent action during 2018. This allows for a direct comparison with peak figures from previous years.\n\nIn countries where the government and food security stakeholders have adopted the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) or the Cadre Harmonisé (CH) as the protocol for classifying the severity and magnitude of acute food insecurity, the number of people in IPC/ CH Phase 3 or above is used to assess the number of food-insecure people in need of urgent assistance. Populations in Crisis (IPC/CH Phase 3), Emergency (IPC/ CH Phase 4) and Catastrophe/Famine (IPC/CH Phase 5)\n\nIPC, 2017 7 are deemed to be those in need of urgent food, nutrition and livelihood assistance. Populations in Stressed (IPC/ CH Phase 2) require a different set of actions -ideally disaster risk reduction and livelihoods protection interventions - and are also reported in Chapter 2. See Annexes 1 and 2 for more explanation of IPC/CH and phase descriptions.\n\nFor countries and territories that lack either an IPC/ CH, estimates of the number of people in need of food assistance were primarily derived from IPC-compatible8 analyses carried out by FEWS NET or Vulnerability Assessment Committees (VAC),9 Food Security Cluster (FSC) reports or Humanitarian Needs Overviews10 (HNO) or WFP Food Security Assessments using CARI methodology.11\n\nSources for the 2019 forecasts of acute food insecurity The sources for the outlook and projected trends for 2019 (presented in chapter 4) vary. They are based on IPC and CH projections, FEWS NET's projected emergency food assistance needs and other reliable sources (VAC, HNOs, etc). FEWS NET's food assistance outlook briefs provide information on the projected severity and magnitude (using ranges) of acute food insecurity and indicate each country's food-insecure population in need of urgent action (IPC Phase 3 or above). FEWS NET projections are based on a scenario development approach, where a set of assumptions regarding the evolution of food security drivers and their impacts on food security outcomes are developed in a most-likely scenario.\n\nCH projections were generated in October-November 2018 and forecast the number of people in CH Phase 3 or above for the West African and Sahel lean season in June-August 2019.\n\nIPC compatible products are generated using key IPC protocols but are not built on multi-partner technical consensus. 9 The VAC assessment process and methodology is coordinated and backstopped by the SADC Food Agriculture and Natural Resources Vulnerability Assessment Committee. Its methodology draws from a livelihood-based vulnerability assessment framework. 10 HNO: Humanitarian Needs Overviews aim to support the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) in developing a shared understanding of the impact and evolution of a crisis and to inform response planning. The HNO includes an assessment of the food security situation, the impact of the crisis, the breakdown of the people in need and the required funds. 11 The CARI is used to classify individual households according to their level of food insecurity. All five indicators included within the CARI approach can be incorporated within IPC analysis; the IPC Technical Manual provides guidance on where each indicator sits within the IPC Analytical Framework. 8\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 9\n\nTable 1 IPC/CH acute food insecurity phase description\n\nPhase Technical description Priority response objective\n\nMinimal More than four in five households in the area are able to meet Resilience building and essential food and non-food needs without engaging in atypical, disaster risk reduction. unsustainable strategies to access food and income, including any reliance on humanitarian assistance. 1\n\nStressed Even with any humanitarian assistance at least one in five Disaster risk reduction and households in the area have the following or worse: minimally protection of livelihoods. adequate food consumption but are unable to afford some essential non-food expenditures without engaging in detrimental coping strategies. 2\n\nCrisis Even with any humanitarian assistance at least one in five URGENT ACTION households in the area have the following or worse: food REQUIRED consumption gaps with high or above usual acute malnutrition OR to protect livelihoods, reduce are marginally able to meet minimum food needs only with food consumption gaps and accelerated depletion of livelihood assets that will lead to food reduce acute malnutrition. consumption gaps. 3\n\nEmergency Even with any humanitarian assistance at least one in five URGENT ACTION households in the area have the following or worse: large food REQUIRED consumption gaps resulting in very high acute malnutrition and to save lives and livelihoods. excess mortality OR extreme loss of livelihood assets that will lead to food consumption gaps in the short term. 4\n\nFamine Even with any humanitarian assistance at least one in five URGENT ACTION households in the area has an extreme lack of food and other REQUIRED basic needs where starvation, death, and destitution are evident. to prevent widespread death and total collapse of livelihoods. 5\n\nThe GRFC focuses on acute food insecurity, mainly based on IPC/CH estimates for food-insecure populations facing Crisis conditions or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above), at the worst (peak) moment in the year, rather than an average condition for the year. These conditions can be highly susceptible to change and can manifest in a population within a short timeframe, as a result of sudden changes or shocks. According to the GRFC 2018, around 124 million people in 51 countries faced Crisis conditions or worse in 2017. Where available, the report highlights the populations in Stressed (IPC/CH Phase 2) for whom disaster risk reduction and protection of livelihoods is needed.\n\nThere is a major conceptual difference between data used for the GRFC and estimates in the State of Food and Nutrition Security in the World (SOFI), which provides estimates of the Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) and of the Prevalence of Food Insecurity (FI) based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). There are two indicators based on the FIES: the prevalence of food insecurity at moderate and severe levels combined, FImod+sev, and at severe levels only, FIsev (see annex 4). Both measures, PoU and FIsev, identify food insecurity faced by households and individuals on average during a year. As such, they could be said to measure chronic food insufficiency and relate to the nutritional indicator of \"chronic undernutrition\". The SOFI 2018 estimated the absolute number of undernourished people at 821 million, and severely food-insecure people at 770 million in 2017.\n\nWhile chronic food insecurity is a long-term or persistent inability to meet food consumption requirements (generally lasting for at least six months of the year) acute or transitory food insecurity is a short-term or temporary inability to meet food consumption requirements related to sporadic crises, indicating a capacity to recover. Acute and chronic food insecurity are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, repeated shocks can provoke ratchets of severe food insecurity, eventually forcing households into destitution and chronic poverty, and potentially leading to starvation. While acute food insecurity may require shorter-term interventions that address immediate causes, interventions tackling root causes may also be important to prevent repeated transitory acute food insecurity, which may lead to chronic food insecurity.\n\nThe GRFC reports acute food insecurity only for countries experiencing food crises; the SOFI provides the number of food-insecure and undernourished people out of the total population of the world.\n\nTWO GLOBAL REPORTS ON HUNGER: THE GRFC AND THE SOFI\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 910\n\nANALYSIS OF MALNUTRITION Malnutrition includes undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight and obesity. Undernutrition refers to the outcome of insufficient intake, and/or poor absorption and/or poor biological use of nutrients consumed. It includes being too short for one's age (stunted), dangerously thin for one's height (wasted), underweight for one's age and deficient in vitamins and minerals (micronutrient deficiencies).\n\nAcute malnutrition Acute malnutrition occurs when an individual is suffering from inadequate nutrient intake. It is characterized by extreme weight loss, and, in its severe form, can lead to death. The immediate cause of this severe nutritional restriction may be inadequate food intake or a recent bout of illness that hinders appropriate intake and absorption of nutrients. Household food insecurity combined with other factors such as inappropriate childcare practices, limited access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities, may lead to restricted dietary intake and frequent illness. Broader basic contributing factors include social, economic, political and environmental contexts, such as adequate health services.12\n\nAcute malnutrition in children can be measured by a low weight-for-height compared to a reference population, which is called wasting, a low mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), and/or the presence of bilateral oedema. Moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) using the weight for height (WFZ) indicator is identified by WFZ measurements below -2 z scores and above -3 z scores of the reference population, and severe acute malnutrition (SAM) by WFZ below -3 z scores. Global acute malnutrition (GAM) reflects the total presence of both MAM and SAM in a population.\n\nUNICEF conceptual framework is available here: https://www.unicef. org/nutrition/training/2.5/4.html 12\n\nAcute malnutrition rates depict the nutrition situation in the general population at a specific time: they can show marked seasonal patterns and can change quickly over time. In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF reviewed the prevalence ranges to re-classify population levels of wasting and stunting, and the terminology used to interpret them.13 See tables 2 and 3.\n\nChronic malnutrition\n\nMalnutrition measured by stunting is characterized by slowed child growth, resulting in failure of a child to reach his/her expected height/length. Stunted children under five years old are identified by a height for age z score (HAZ) below -2 of the reference population. Severe stunting is defined as HAZ below -3. A stunted child is at higher risk of illness and more likely to develop poor physical and cognitive skills throughout childhood and into adolescence, affecting labour productivity, incomeearning potential and social skills later in life, with consequences beyond the individual level, potentially undermining the economic development of communities and nations.\n\nDe Onis et al. Prevalence thresholds for wasting, overweight and stunting in children under 5 years. Public Health Nutrition, pages 1-5 13\n\nSources of malnutrition data\n\nThe GRFC reviews and analyses available country data on anthropometry, dietary intake, infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices, health and WASH indicators from nutrition surveys - conducted at national and also sub-national level. These include representative SMART (Standardized Monitoring and Assessment for Relief and Transitions) surveys, Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicators Cluster Surveys (MICS), National Vulnerability Assessments and Analysis, and Infant and Young Child Feeding - Knowledge Attitude and Practices Assessments (IYCF KAP).\n\nEstimates of the number of children affected by acute malnutrition are in-country calculations officially approved by the nutrition clusters/sectors and shared in key planning documents such as HNO and HRP.\n\nIn 2018, seven countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Kenya, Mozambique, Somalia and South Sudan) conducted an IPC acute malnutrition analysis to understand the severity and main factors affecting the nutritional status of a population in areas with a high rate of acute malnutrition. In countries that conducted two IPC analysis processes in a year, the most recent analysis was included.\n\nMicronutrient deficiencies - caused by a lack of intake, absorption or use of one or more vitamins or minerals such as vitamin A, iron and zinc14 - are often referred to as 'hidden hunger' because they develop gradually over time, and a large percentage of the population may be deficient without showing any clinical symptoms or signs of deficiency.15\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 912\n\nLIMITATIONS\n\nConsensus\n\nAll partners are in agreement with the general magnitude and severity of acute food insecurity indicated for the countries included in this report, except Afghanistan, Burundi, The Democratic Republic of the Congo and Haiti, for which FEWS NET analyses of available evidence suggest the population requiring emergency food assistance in 2018 was lower than Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) estimates, because of different interpretation of data related to factors contributing to food insecurity.\n\nData gaps\n\nSome countries and territories are not included in the report because of the lack of recently validated data. In 2018, data gaps on acute food insecurity were observed for: Angola, the Congo, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Syrian refugees in Egypt, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, the United Republic of Tanzania, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) and Western Sahara. This underlines the need for the Global Network against Food Crises to campaign for investments in food security monitoring systems at country and regional level.\n\nNutrition data availability varied from country to country and by geographic areas within countries. Most countries had conducted a national survey in the previous three to five years (except for Iraq, Madagascar, Mozambique, Somalia and South Sudan), but the aggregated values reported at national level sometimes differ greatly from values reported in the food crisis-affected areas of the country. In 2018, only seven countries conducted IPC acute malnutrition analyses, but a roll-out plan continues\n\nMinimum acceptable diet\n\nExclusive breastfeeding\n\nAccess to safe drinking water\n\nOTHER NUTRITION INDICATORS USED IN GRFC\n\nA composite indicator that combines minimum meal frequency (proportion of breastfed and non-breastfed children aged 6-23 months, who receive solid, semi-solid, or soft foods at least the minimum number of recommended times a day) and minimum dietary diversity (proportion of children aged 6-23 months who receive foods from more than four food groups out of seven a day) to assess the percentage consuming a diet that meets the minimum acceptable level of quality and quantity for growth and development.1\n\nWHO recommends that infants are fed exclusively with breast milk up to six months of age. This indicator refers to the percentage of infants (up to six months old) who are exclusively breastfed.\n\nThis indicator assesses the percentage of households that have safe and equitable access to a sufficient quantity of water for drinking, cooking and personal and domestic hygiene. This includes public water points being sufficiently close to households to enable use of the minimum water requirement.2\n\nSource WHO: Indicators for assessing infant and young child feeding practices 2 SPHERE standards handbook 1\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 13 to expand the use of this framework to more countries. The biggest data availability challenges remain in inaccessible areas of countries where conflict and insecurity are particularly severe. It is particularly difficult to obtain reliable nutrition data for displaced populations in affected regions.\n\nComparability challenges\n\nFor some countries, the coverage of food security analyses within and between years varies in terms of population (e.g. rural only vs. rural and urban) and/ or areas analysed (e.g. part of the country vs. whole country). This affects the comparability of the number of food-insecure people between time periods. In a few countries (e.g. Bangladesh, Pakistan, Djibouti), no IPC acute food insecurity analysis was conducted in 2018. Depending on whether other comparable sources of information could be found, this hampers comparability with previous years and highlights the importance for countries that face food crises to conduct an IPC analysis at least on a yearly basis.\n\nData gaps can mean data that are: A few countries included in this report (i.e. Afghanistan, Haiti, South Sudan and Yemen) tested or rolled out the new IPC Version 3.0 protocols in 2018. This implies some changes in methodology, in particular regarding the non-inclusion of the mitigating effects of humanitarian food assistance on food insecurity in projected analyses. However, this did not affect the comparability of numbers of food-insecure people with previous years and between countries for various reasons: in some countries (e.g. Haiti), the level of humanitarian food assistance was not significant enough to make a meaningful difference in the overall number of food-insecure people. In others, the peak number of food-insecure people reported in this report takes into account the mitigating effects of humanitarian food assistance, similar to countries using IPC Version 2.0 protocols.\n\nThe number of people in IPC Phase 3 or above does not necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent action to decrease food gaps and protect and save lives and livelihoods. This is because current population tables identify those found in different severity phases, all things considered and including the mitigating effects of any assistance received. As such, some households may be in IPC Phase 1 or 2 but only because of receipt of assistance, and as a result may be in need of continued action. In areas where assistance is significant, decisionmakers should be informed that estimations incorporate effects of any assistance delivered and they do not reflect total number of people in need of action.\n\nLack of predictive analysis\n\nFor the 2019 forecasts, estimates of the future foodinsecure populations for some countries are presented as ranges, rather than point estimates, to reflect the higher level of uncertainty. Additionally, many countries cannot be included because there are no projections for 2019 food security outcomes, thus only drivers are indicated.\n\nNot collected/ area inaccessible\n\nNot disaggregated by gender, age or IPC/CH phases\n\nIncomplete\n\nNot comparable across time or geographical areas\n\nScattered across various sources a n a l y s i s o f f o o d c r i s e s i n 2 0 1 8\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 914\n\nFP /T\n\nA C\n\nR O\n\nSS LE\n\nY ANALYSIS OF FOOD CRISES IN 2018 2.\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 15\n\nSince the Global Report on Food Crises launched in 2017, more than 100 million people each year (2016, 2017 and 2018) have been in need of urgent food, nutrition and livelihood assistance. The GRFC 2019 shows that in 2018, out of 803 million people analysed, 113 million people in 53 countries or territories - 14 percent of the population analysed - were in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above). This humanitarian situation has been driven primarily by three factors: conflict/insecurity, climate shocks and economic shocks - or a mutually reinforcing combination of two or all of these drivers - which result in food crises. Strikingly, three conflict-affected countries (Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Afghanistan) each had more than 10 million people in Crisis conditions or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above), totalling almost 40 million people and accounting for 35 percent of the aggregate number in IPC/CH Phase 3 or above in 2018. Another five countries (Ethiopia, north Nigeria, South Sudan, the Sudan and the Syrian Arab Republic) each had 5-10 million people in Crisis or worse (IPC/ CH Phase 3 or above). Together these eight countries/ regions had nearly 72 million people in need of urgent food and livelihood support and accounted for 64 percent of the aggregate number.\n\nIn addition, very large numbers - nearly 143 million people in a subset of 42 countries or territories for which this analysis was carried out - were classified in Stressed (IPC/CH Phase 2) and may slip into IPC/CH Phase 3 or above if confronted with an additional shock or stressor.\n\nThe analysis shows that more than half (74 million people) of those facing Crisis (IPC/CH Phase 3) conditions or worse were in 21 countries or territories affected by conflict/insecurity: 33 million of these people were in 10 countries in Africa, over 27 million in seven countries or territories in West Asia/Middle East, 13 million in three countries in South/Southeast Asia and 1.1 million in Eastern Europe.\n\nClimate-related shocks were the main drivers of food insecurity in nearly half (26) of the 53 countries analysed, accounting for 29 million people in IPC/CH Phase 3 or above. As in previous years, in 2018 most of these people were in Africa, with nearly 23 million in IPC/CH Phase 3 or above in 20 countries affected by climate shocks. In Central America and the Caribbean, five countries (El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras and Nicaragua) collectively had 3.8 million acutely food insecure mainly as a result of climate shocks. Out of these 26 countries with climate as the primary driver, 22 had 35 million in Stressed (IPC/CH Phase 2) and on the cusp of slipping into Crisis (IPC Phase 3).\n\nIn 2018, economic shocks were considered the primary driver of the acute food insecurity of 10.2 million people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) in three countries (Burundi, the Sudan and Zimbabwe) and for three selected migrant populations (Venezuelan migrants in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru). An additional 14.3 million people were classified in Stressed (IPC/CH Phase 2) in four of these countries.\n\nYemen remained the world's gravest food insecurity crisis in 2018. By the end of the year the crisis reached a critical point that drew attention to the urgent need for an implemented cessation of hostilities to avert famine. For the first time the Yemen IPC Technical Working Group classified people (65 000) in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5), indicating extreme food gaps and/or the inability of some population groups to meet basic food needs without full employment of coping strategies. Without humanitarian food assistance the number facing Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) would have been about 238 000.\n\nWhile the humanitarian landscape in 2017 was marked by the declaration of famine in areas of South Sudan and the risk of famine (in a worst-case scenario) in northeastern Nigeria and Somalia, there was no declaration of famine in 2018 and no population groups were classified in Famine (CH Phase 5) in 2018 in northeastern Nigeria. However, besides the abovementioned numbers in Yemen, around 47 000 in South Sudan still faced Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) in the latter half of 2018.\n\nHigh levels of acute and chronic malnutrition persist in countries affected by food crises, threatening, in particular, the health and lives of young children and women. Acute malnutrition significantly worsened between 2017 and 2018 in areas of Afghanistan, South Sudan, northeastern Nigeria, Yemen, the Syrian Arab Republic (Eastern Ghouta, Ar Raqqa and Idlib) and across the six countries of the Sahel region (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, the Niger and Senegal).\n\nInformation and technology can capture changes in food security - especially in fragile countries and contexts - on a near real-time basis. Though this report demonstrates that overall quality of data has improved, there are countries for which there are data gaps. Collecting and analysing data on vulnerable populations is vital to ensure a situation analysis that identifies not only outcomes, but hunger's key drivers for a targeted and integrated response for multiple partners working in development and humanitarian spheres.\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 916\n\nIn the last 10 years, humanitarian assistance and spending needs have grown by around 127 percent - approximately 40 percent of that went to cover needs in the food and agriculture subsectors. The surge in humanitarian needs - as well as the potential for agricultural development and rural resilience-building to provide a buffer against crises - highlights the need for a new way of responding to the food security challenges of this new era.\n\nThe findings of this report clearly underscore the need for simultaneous action across the humanitarian- development nexus, along with investments in conflict prevention and sustaining peace, when appropriate, to save lives and livelihoods, reduce structural vulnerabilities and address the root causes of hunger.\n\nThe regional perspective\n\nOver half of the global total of acutely food-insecure people estimated by the GRFC 2019 were in Africa, where there were over 65 million people in need of urgent action. East Africa had the highest number of acutely food-insecure people (28.6 million) followed by southern Africa (23.3 million) and West Africa and the Sahel (11.2 million).\n\nWith 27.4 million food-insecure people in need of urgent action, the seven Middle-Eastern countries or territories accounted for 24 percent of the global total estimated by the GRFC 2019.\n\nWith 14.7 million food-insecure people in need of urgent action, four countries in South and South-East Asia (Myanmar, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan) accounted for 13 percent of the GRFC 2019 total.\n\nThe remaining five percent were in Ukraine (1.1 million) and Latin America and the Caribbean with 4.2 million food-insecure people in need of urgent action across eight countries (Haiti with 2.3 million), Central America (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua 'Dry Corridor' with 1.6 million), and South America (0.4 million among Venezuelan migrants in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru).\n\nWhile Latin America and the Caribbean was home to just a fraction of the global number of acutely foodinsecure people in need of urgent action (four percent of the GRFC 2019 total) it had high numbers (5.6 million) in Stressed (IPC/CH Phase 2) across seven countries (Stressed figures were not available for Nicaragua). These populations require support to reduce disaster risks and protect their livelihoods, and to prevent them from slipping into more severe levels of acute food insecurity when climate and economic shocks occur.\n\nYear on year comparisons\n\nIn 2016 there were 108 million people across 48 countries facing Crisis food insecurity or worse (IPC/ CH Phase 3 or above). In 2017 there were 124 million people in 51 countries or territories.\n\nAvailability of data played an important role in the difference in numbers. When an analysis was conducted comparing the 42 countries analysed each year, it showed the same pattern as the overall comparison, i.e. an increase between 2016 and 2017, followed by a decrease between 2017 and 2018.\n\nThe 14 million increase between 2016 and 2017 (like for like) was largely attributed to intensified conflict or insecurity in countries such as Yemen, north Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Myanmar. Persistent drought also played a major role, causing consecutive poor harvests in countries already facing high levels of food insecurity in eastern and southern Africa.\n\nThe 6 million decrease between 2017 and 2018 can be explained by a number of factors. Firstly, some 26 countries did see a less severe peak in the numbers of acutely food insecure people in 2018 by comparison with 2017. These include countries in southern and eastern Africa, the Horn of Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Asia-Pacific region, which did not experience the intensity of shocks and stressors that they were still experiencing in 2017 as a result of severe drought, flooding, rains, and temperature rises due to the El Niño of 2015-16. However, in 2018 some were still experiencing the lingering effects of past climate shocks or saw improvements in crop yields offset by severe economic challenges and high food prices, resulting in a worsening food security situation as the year progressed (Zimbabwe).\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 17\n\n113M 108M\n\n2016 2017 2018\n\n124M\n\n98M 112M\n\n106M Total number of people in 42 countries analysed each year (like for like)\n\nTotal number of people\n\nThe most significant decreases between 2017 and 2018 were in Bangladesh, Cameroon, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria and Zimbabwe. For Bangladesh and Cameroon, the geographical coverage differs between the two years. For Nigeria the improvement could be attributed to provision of humanitarian food assistance and better harvest.\n\nNotably, 17 countries faced either the same or higher numbers of people in IPC/CH Phase 3 or above, with the biggest increases in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan and Zambia.\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 918\n\nTable 5 Highest number and share of food-insecure population in 2018\n\nCountry Total population Percentage of Population in Crisis or worse Population in Stressed analysed population analysed (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) (IPC/CH Phase 2) out of total population of reference\n\nNumber % Number % of total Number % of total (millions) (millions) population analysed (millions) population analysed Afghanistan1 22.6 65% 10.6 47% 6.8 30% Bangladesh (Cox's Bazaar refugee and host populations) 1.5 1.3 87% N/A N/A Burkina Faso1 20.1 97% 1.0 5% 2.7 13% Burundi1 3 11.0 98% 1.7 16% N/A N/A Cabo Verde1 0.5 99% 0.02 4% 0.1 20% Cameroon (7 regions) 15.8 64% 0.5 3% 2.9 18% Central African Republic1 4.4 95% 1.9 43% 1.8 41% Chad1 13.9 90% 1.0 7% 2.9 21% Colombia (Venezuelan migrants) 1.1 100% 0.3 30% 0.3 30% Cote d'Ivoire 19.8 80% 0.04 0% 3.0 15% Democratic Republic of the Congo1 56.2 66% 13.1 23% 27.4 49% Djibouti (rural areas) 0.2 16% 0.15 55% 0.1 40% Ecuador (Venezuelan migrants) 0.1 20% 0.02 23% 0.1 60% El Salvador (Dry Corridor) 1.4 22% 0.2 16% 0.4 28% eSwatini1 1.1 79% 0.2 23% 0.3 28% Ethiopia 96.5 100% 8.1 8% N/A N/A Gambia1 1.8 83% 0.1 6% 0.4 21% Guatemala (Dry Corridor) 5.9 34% 0.8 14% 1.4 23% Guinea 10.0 100% 0.1 1% 0.9 9% Guinea-Bissau 1.2 65% 0.01 1% 0.1 11% Haiti1 7.0 63% 2.3 32% 2.4 35% Honduras (Dry Corridor) 2.8 30% 0.5 19% 0.8 28% Iraq 37.0 100% 2.5 7% N/A N/A Jordan (Syrian refugees) 0.7 100% 0.1 14% 0.4 66% Kenya 46.3 100% 2.6 6% N/A N/A Lebanon (Syrian refugees) 1.5 100% 0.5 34% 0.9 57% Lesotho1 1.5 64% 0.3 19% 0.5 33% Liberia 4.2 87% 0.04 1% 0.6 15% Libya 6.6 100% 0.3 5% N/A N/A Madagascar (southern and southeastern)1 3.0 12% 1.5 51% 0.7 22% Malawi1 15.3 79% 3.3 22% 5.0 33% Mali1 18.9 97% 0.9 5% 3.4 18% Mauritania1 4.0 88% 0.5 14% 1.0 24% Mozambique1 28.8 94% 1.8 6% 7.8 27% Myanmar (selected areas) 7.4 14% 0.8 11% N/A N/A Nicaragua 6.0 100% 0.02 0% N/A N/A Niger1 20.9 94% 0.8 4% 5.0 24% Nigeria (16 states and Federal Capital Territory)1 98.6 50% 5.3 5% 22.7 23% Pakistan (Sindh drought-affected areas) 2.3 1% 2.0 87% 0.2 11% Palestine (occupied territories of) 5.0 100% 1.7 34% 0.8 17% Peru (Venezuelan migrants) 0.3 55% 0.04 14% 0.2 82% Senegal1 12.5 77% 0.8 6% 3.2 26% Sierra Leone 6.6 86% 0.1 2% 1.5 23% Somalia1 12.3 89% 2.7 22% 2.7 22% South Sudan2 10.4 93% 6.1 59% 3.2 31% Sudan1 43.9 100% 6.2 14% 13.7 31% Syrian Arab Republic 20.0 100% 6.5 33% 2.5 13% Turkey (Syrian refugees) 2.2 60% 0.2 11% 1.3 61% Uganda 40.0 100% 1.1 3% N/A N/A Ukraine (Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts, and IDP) 6.2 15% 1.1 18% N/A N/A Yemen2 29.9 100% 15.9 53% 8.9 30% Zambia1 6.9 39% 1.2 17% 2.0 28% Zimbabwe 9.3 67% 1.9 20% N/A N/A 1 The estimates for this country contains population classified in Emergency (IPC/CH Phase 4) 2 The estimates for this country contains population classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) 3 For Burundi, the estimate of population in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) is not reported as it is merged with the estimates of population in Minimal (IPC Phase 1) All partners are in agreement with the general magnitude and severity of acute food insecurity indicated for the countries included in this report, except Afghanistan, Burundi, The Democratic Republic of Congo and Haiti, for which FEWS NET analyses of available evidence suggest the population requiring emergency food assistance in 2018 was lower than Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) estimates, because of different interpretation of data related to factors contributing to food insecurity\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 19\n\nThe world's eight worst food crises in 2018\n\nYemen remained the world's gravest food insecurity crisis in 2018. By the end of the year the crisis reached a critical point that drew attention to the urgent need for an implemented cessation of hostilities to avert famine. More than half (53 percent) of the total population was in urgent need of food and livelihood assistance (IPC Phases 3 or above) from December 2018 to January 2019, even when taking into account the mitigating effects of food assistance.\n\nAfter Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had the highest number (13 million) of acutely food insecure people in urgent need of assistance in the second half of 2018. This represents the biggest year on year deterioration following armed conflict in Ituri and South Kivu, fighting in the eastern and southern areas, and the humanitarian crisis in the Kasai region. Localized floods compounded the impact of persistent insecurity, disrupting agricultural activities, markets and humanitarian assistance while an ongoing outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) further disrupted livelihoods.\n\nCountries whose economic bases have been destroyed by years of conflict cannot cope with the consequences of (recurrent) natural disasters. In Afghanistan severe drought in 2018 constrained food production and stripped farmers and livestock keepers of their assets and livelihoods, creating the country's worst food insecurity emergency since the 2011 drought. The number of rural Afghans facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) was projected to reach 10.6 million (47 percent of the rural population) in the winter months (November 2018-February 2019) if urgent food assistance was not provided.\n\nIn Ethiopia, despite major improvements in southern pastoral areas in late 2017 and early 2018, the country still faced a major food security emergency in 2018 with 8 million people in need of food assistance. This was driven by several inter-related factors: the aftermath of three preceding years of poor rainfall, intercommunal conflict driving mass displacement, currency devaluation, high food prices, localized floods and dry spells.\n\nIn 2018 the Syrian Arab Republic suffered its worst drought in 30 years followed by heavy, out-of-season rains, which, coupled with the effects of conflict, caused wheat production to hit a three-decade low. An estimated 6.5 million Syrians are food insecure in need of urgent action.\n\nSince late 2017, the Sudan was facing major macroeconomic challenges, illustrated by a spiralling parallel foreign exchange rate, dwindling foreign currency 15.9M people in Crisis or worse 13.1M people in Crisis or worse 10.6M people in Crisis or worse 8.1M people in need of assistance 6.5M people in need of assistance\n\n36% in Crisis (IPC Phase 3)\n\n17% in Emergency (IPC Phase 4)\n\n17% in Crisis (IPC Phase 3)\n\n34% in Crisis (IPC Phase 3)\n\n8% food-insecure people in need of assistance\n\n36% food-insecure people in need of assistance 0.2% in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5)\n\n6% in Emergency (IPC Phase 4)\n\n13% in Emergency (IPC Phase 4)\n\nYEMEN\n\nTHE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO\n\nTHE SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 920 reserves and increasing inflation rates, resulting in reduced imports of fuel and agricultural inputs. Rising poverty levels reduced access to food and basic services, resulting in 6.2 million being acutely food insecure during the 2018 lean season.\n\nFive years of persistent conflict, widespread and recurrent displacement, record low 2017 cereal production, very high food prices, loss of livelihoods and limited access to markets drove rising hunger in South Sudan. At the peak of the 2018 lean season, 59 percent of the analysed population or 6 million people needed urgent food and livelihood assistance (IPC Phase 3 or above) compared with 55 percent during the same period the previous year.\n\nIn the 16 states of north Nigeria and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) the number of people in Crisis (CH Phase 3) and Emergency (CH Phase 4) decreased by 40 percent between June-August 2017 and 2018 to 5.3 million. At the peak of the lean season 3 million were acutely food insecure in the three north-eastern states affected by the Boko Haram insurgency where protracted conflict and mass displacement disrupted agriculture, trade, markets and livelihoods, and pushed up food prices.\n\nMAIN DRIVERS OF FOOD INSECURITY IN 2018\n\nWhile the GRFC gives a clear idea of the number of acutely food-insecure people by each of the three primary drivers it must be emphasized that these drivers often co-exist or reinforce each other.\n\nConflict and insecurity\n\nLast year's GRFC found there were 74 million people in 18 conflict-affected areas experiencing acute food insecurity in 2017. Conflict remained the number one driver of acute food insecurity in 2018. This year's report shows that in 2018 again 74 million people - this time in 21 conflict-afflicted countries and territories - were in Crisis or worse. As conflicts become more protracted the resilience and coping capacities of the people caught up in them is eroded.\n\nIntensified conflict and insecurity in Afghanistan as well as in Yemen, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic, either worsened or kept acute food insecurity at similar levels to the previous year, demonstrating the persistent and destructive link between conflict and hunger. High levels of acute food insecurity persisted in other key conflict-\n\n10M acutely food-insecure people affected by economic shocks\n\n29M acutely foodinsecure people in 26 climate-affected countries\n\n74M acutely foodinsecure people in 21 conflictaffected countries or territories\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 21\n\nMap 1 Number of people in IPC/CH Phase 3 or above (ranges) in 2018\n\nMap 2 Share of people in IPC/CH Phase 3 or above (ranges) in 2018\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 922 affected countries/territories including the Syrian Arab Republic, Lake Chad Basin and Somalia. The observed trends make clear that besides many efforts to stabilize these situations and promote peace, more needs to be done to provide support to populations and ensure the international community is equipped to operate in these environments.\n\nIn conflict civilians are frequently pushed into acute food insecurity when they are displaced and deprived of their income sources. Food systems and markets are disrupted, pushing up food prices and sometimes leading to scarcities of water and fuel, or of food itself. Landmines, explosive remnants of war and improvised explosive devices often destroy agricultural land, mills, storage facilities, machinery etc. Conflict prevents businesses from operating and weakens the national economy, reducing employment opportunities and increasing poverty levels. It undermines and sometimes destroys health and public distribution systems leaving people reliant on humanitarian support - yet insecurity and unserviceable roads can prevent humanitarian convoys from reaching them. Armed conflict has particular impact on women and children, including as refugees and IDPs, and on people with vulnerabilities including those with disabilities and the elderly.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, in 2018 the UN Security Council unanimously endorsed Resolution 2417, which provides a framework to address conflict-induced hunger by allowing the Council to consider its full range of tools - including sanctions - to ensure that all parties to conflict uphold International Humanitarian Law (IHL). Violations of IHL include starving civilians as a weapon of war, unlawfully denying humanitarian access to civilian populations in need and depriving people of their means to produce food.\n\nHowever, new conflicts are emerging and finding sustainable political resolutions to ongoing crises is becoming increasingly difficult.\n\nIn many conflict-affected countries there are areas that humanitarian agencies cannot reach with aid. Or they face lengthy delays, with restrictions on personnel or the type or quantity of aid supplies, or insufficient security\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 23 guarantees.1 As a result, securing access becomes timeconsuming, costly and aid delivery for civilians in need is inadequate or inconsistent during certain periods.2 Deliberate targeting of aid workers persisted in 2018. According to the Aid Worker Security Database there were 310 deliberate acts of violence affecting mainly national aid workers, such as killings, kidnappings, and attacks that resulted in serious injury in 2018, 313 in 2017 and 294 in 2016. The most dangerous countries in 2018 were South Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nUNSC Resolution 2417 also identifies the linkage between protection of medical facilities and the\n\nUN Security Council meeting 12 March, 2018 2 Ibid 1 prevention of famine and food insecurity. In Yemen, conflict, attacks on medical facilities and the lack of salary payments to medical staff have led to the closure of more than half of the country's medical facilities,3 leaving most of the country's 500 000 children who are suffering from severe acute malnutrition4 unable to receive lifesaving nutritional support and other treatment. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, armed conflict is inhibiting the response to the second largest Ebola outbreak in history in North Kivu.5 Attacks on health workers and food security and nutrition actors' inability to obtain security guarantees from non-state armed groups means it is much more difficult to provide the food and nutrition response necessary to contain the outbreak.\n\nMedecins Sans Frontieres country brief 4 WHO April 2018 5 WFP News Release. WFP launches emergency food aid to Ebola 3 victims in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, August 2018\n\nArmed conflict affects men and women, girls and boys differently. Emergencies can exacerbate the existing power inequalities between women and men leading to increased discrimination and exploitation. Men and women have different needs, different coping mechanisms and different opportunities to benefit from support in crises. What's more, women and girls are an important resource in designing and delivering humanitarian assistance.\n\nPromoting gender equality in humanitarian action facilitates the right to information and participation for all; increases access to assistance and decreases vulnerability levels; affords protection, dignity and safety from GBV; and provides the opportunity to change norms, shifting towards equality, empowerment and transformative change. A gender equality perspective is also about assistance being designed and delivered based on the \"do no harm\" approach, in a way that does not trigger armed conflict, exacerbate tensions between population groups or expose people to violence and other forms of abuse such as GBV. Programmes that lack a gender perspective risk\n\nDISAGGREGATED GENDER ANALYSIS IS VITAL IN EMERGENCIES being off-target, not reaching the most excluded, providing support in an inadequate manner or even inadvertently causing harm.\n\nThe responsibility of humanitarians to make sure that assistance and protection meet the needs, capacities and priorities of women, girls, men and boys in an equitable and empowering way and that their rights are protected and promoted touches all phases of the humanitarian programme cycle.\n\nIn the needs assessment and analysis phase data must be disaggregated by gender and interventions should reflect gender-specific needs. Gender analysis should understand the experiences of all women and men and within different contexts and the specific barriers and bottlenecks that they face. Critically, gender analysis must also understand how humanitarian engagement can create conditions for women and girls to empower themselves, to exercise leadership and promote health and well-being and be fully involved in efforts to prevent and resolve the growing number of armed conflicts.\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 924\n\nClimate-related shocks\n\nClimate-related disasters, such as drought, floods and tropical storms are among the main drivers of food insecurity, both in the aftermath of a disaster and in the long run. Weather extremes, such as droughts and floods, have more than doubled since the early 1990s.6 Observed data and many studies also indicate that a warming climate has a negative effect on crop production and generally reduces yields of staple cereals such as wheat, rice, and maize in many areas.7 Smallholder farmers who are dependent on rainfed agriculture and living in the earth's more fragile environments are particularly vulnerable.\n\nLast year's GRFC found there were 39 million acutely food-insecure people in 13 countries affected by climaterelated shocks in 2017. In 2018, 29 million people were acutely food insecure in 26 countries affected by climaterelated shocks with 23 million of them in 20 African countries, according to the GRFC 2019.\n\nThis marks an improvement largely because overall good production outturns in the last two years have had a stabilizing impact on food security in several countries of southern Africa compared with 2017, which was marked by the prolonged impact of the 2015-2016 El Niñoinduced drought. In Malawi, the number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) decreased from almost 7 million in late 2016 and 5.1 million in early 2017 to 3.3 million in late 2018.\n\nHowever, weather shocks, notably droughts in 2018, intensified food insecurity in other regions. In Afghanistan, drought in 2018 taking place amid a protracted conflict escalated the food crisis, making this Afghanistan's worst food insecurity emergency since the 2011 drought.8 The lack of water had such dramatic effect because the local coping capacities of institutions and households were largely depleted by decades of conflict and the ability to deliver aid was highly constrained by the intensification of violence. In the Syrian Arab Republic the worst drought in 30 years was followed by heavy, out-of-season rains, which, coupled with the effects of conflict, made wheat production plummet to its lowest level since 1989.\n\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2018 7 IPCC. Food Security and Food Production Systems 8 FEWS NET. Afghanistan, Key message update, September 2018 6\n\nIn South America, dry weather conditions lowered cereal harvests compared to last year's record high. In Central America and the Caribbean, the drought was not as drastic as in 2015, but it was severe enough to have a negative impact on agricultural output in several areas.9 In the Central America Dry Corridor (CADC), a territory shared by Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua as well as the Dry ARCH of Panama, from November 2018 to March 2019 1.6 million were classified in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above). Half of them (0.8 million) were in Guatemala and the remaining 0.8 million in El Salvador and Honduras.\n\nIn contrast to conflict situations where persistent levels of acute food insecurity are observed (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above), climate-related food insecurity can be of a more temporary nature. The generally low resilience of farmers renders them highly susceptible to climatic shocks, heightening the likelihood of households slipping into worse conditions (i.e. IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) in the event of weather shocks.\n\nAround 35 million people in climate-affected countries were classified in Stressed (IPC/CH Phase 2) and likely to shift into a worse phase if they faced a shock or stressor. Frequent climate shocks erode the already-poor coping capacities of households making them increasingly less equipped for the next shock. This is particularly pertinent given the less favourable weather conditions during the 2018/19 cropping season that have increased the probability of a drop in agricultural production in 2019 and the fact that climate shocks are set to become more frequent and intense.\n\nPeople in conflict settings are also affected by climate extremes that constitute aggravating factors and contribute to fuelling conflict. For instance, the number of new displacements in Ethiopia increased sharply in the first half of 2018 to 1.4 million mainly associated with the outbreak of new intercommunal conflict along the border between Oromia and SNNPR regions in April and June. It is thought that disputes over borders and the allocation of pasture and water resources are likely to have contributed to the sudden escalation of violence.10\n\nClimate shocks are a main driver of displacement. On average 22 million people are displaced annually because of climate-related disasters.11 It is already\n\nGIEWS Update, Central America drought causes, crop losses in Dry Corridor in Central America, August 2018 10 Internal Displacement mid-year figures September 2018 11 SOFI 2018 9\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 25 recognised that warming beyond 1.5°C (the world has already warmed by 1°C above pre-industrial levels) could lead to a higher risk of food shortages in many regions already on the brink of hunger crisis, including the Sahel.12 A 2°C warmer world would add an estimated 189 million more people to the 821 million who are already suffering from chronic food shortages.13\n\nAlthough food prices declined globally in 2018 - the FAO Food Price Index for the whole year was 3.5 percent below 2017's level and 27 percent lower than its record high of 201114 - rising unemployment, lack of sustainable livelihoods or regular reliable work, currency depreciation, poor functioning markets and high food prices are regular outcomes in countries experiencing protracted conflict, often making economic shocks a secondary or tertiary driver of food insecurity. In 2018, economic shocks were considered the primary driver of the acute food insecurity of 10.2 million people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) in three countries (Burundi, the Sudan and Zimbabwe) and Venezuelan migrants in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.\n\nYemen saw significant increases in food prices driven by conflict and a severe economic liquidity crisis. During September 2018 alone, on the parallel market the local currency lost a fifth of its value relative to the USD, and almost half its value on a yearly basis.15\n\nVenezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) has experienced severe economic and political turmoil that triggered massive increases in the price of food and other basic commodities. This hyperinflation has drastically cut people's purchasing power, curbing access to food. Many of the Venezuelans seeking refuge in neighbouring countries have exhausted their means to buy food (see box).\n\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2018 13 WFP 2018 https://www.wfp.org/content/2017-2-and-4-degrees- 12 infographic 14 FAO Food Prices Index, January 2019 15 Exchange rate data for Yemen extracted from http://dataviz.vam. wfp.org/economic_explorer/prices?iso3=YEM In Turkey, which hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, signs of a significant slowdown in economic growth and an increasingly fragile external financial situation led to a sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira against the USD, i.e. 52 percent lower in September 2018 compared to 2015.16 This contributed to year-on-year food inflation of 29 percent in October 2018, with both Syrian refugees and the vulnerable host population seeing their purchasing power to buy food and other essentials severely weakened.\n\nIn West Africa (Burkina Faso, Mali and north-east Nigeria) and East Africa (South Sudan and the Sudan), elevated prices were observed for most of the year instigated by production shortfalls, currency depreciation, insecurity and policies such as large-scale restocking of national inventories or subsidy cuts. A loss in the value of the currency as well as limited availability of fuel contributed significantly to the continuous increase in cereal prices in the Sudan, with prices reaching record or near-record levels in December. Currency devaluation drove prices up in South Sudan, Nigeria and Zambia.\n\nIn southern Africa, while prices were mostly stable in the first half of 2018, sharply reduced supplies in Madagascar spurred rice prices to record highs in early 2018, and towards the end of the year food prices climbed abruptly in several other southern African countries. Following substantial rises in the last quarter of 2018, Zimbabwe's annual inflation rate surged to 42 percent in December. Given the generally large share of income allocated to food expenditure by poorer households, these elevated prices hit the poorest particularly hard.\n\nMaize prices climbed steeply in several Central American countries, on the back of rising production costs and concerns over the impact of severe dry weather on the main season crops, reaching near record highs. In Nicaragua social unrest disrupted marketing activities that further amplified price increases in 2018. In Asia, prices of rice in the Philippines reached record highs in September 2018 as a result of low public inventories and increased fuel costs. Prices fell in the latter months of the year with the start of the main harvest and imports.\n\nWFP. Turkish economic slowdown: implications on WFP's work.

Between June and August, about 5 million people were in urgent need of food, nutrition and livelihood assistance in Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, the Niger and Senegal, according to the Cadre Harmonisé1 - a 20 percent increase compared to a year earlier,2 in a context of extreme vulnerability and increasing hardship.3 Severe rainfall deficits, localized production shortfalls, high food prices, reduced incomes resulting from declining livestock sales, in tandem with conflict, insecurity and market disruption drove this severely deteriorating food insecurity situation since the end of 2017.4\n\nIn the first half of 2018, many zones across the region had alarming levels of global acute malnutrition, exceeding the emergency thresholds.\n\nCadre Harmonisé Analyse régionale de la situation de l'insécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle aigüe, March 2018 2 Cadre Harmonisé Analyse régionale de la situation de l'insécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle aigüe, March 2017 3 OCHA Crise alimentaire et nutritionnelle aiguë au Sahel, June 2018 4 FAO Crop Prospects and Food Situation no. 2, June 2018 1\n\nThe Sahel pastoralist region experienced severe rainfall deficits and conflict/insecurity Across the six countries, up to 1.6 million children were reported to be at risk of suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM), an increase of more than 50 percent since 2017, and 3.4 million from moderate acute malnutrition (MAM).5 Mauritania, Mali and the Niger reported the highest rates of acute malnutrition driven by inadequate caring practices and high burden of disease,6 aggravated by acute water shortages, increased use of coping strategies such as cutting down on meals, and not receiving health treatment.\n\nOvergrazing and severe pasture degradation led to limited or no fodder production in 2018. The lack of fodder and water led pastoralist households, who make up 30 per cent of the Sahel's population,7 to bring forward their migration by two months, causing high herd concentrations in certain areas and localized conflicts between farmers and herders.8 An animal foot and mouth disease CILSS.

Conflict disrupted basic services and livelihoods, and hindered access and delivery of assistance. As of June, the six countries hosted around 293 000 IDPs and 718 000 refugees.11 Relations between farmers and pastoral livestock herders, once cooperative and symbiotic, became confrontational with increasingly frequent, intense violent clashes.\n\nWFP West and central Africa Bulletin, June 2018 10 FEWS NET West Africa Key Message Update, June 2018 11 OCHA Crise alimentaire et nutritionnelle aigüe au Sahel, June 9\n\nThe outlook for vulnerable pastoralists and agropastoralists across the region is bleak, necessitating a scale-up of emergency livelihoods assistance. Overgrazing, pasture degradation and lack of fodder production, the emergence of transboundary epidemics and increasing risk of conflict over natural resources all threaten to undermine livelihoods in the coming years.12 The drivers of fragility and conflict include lack of basic services, high unemployment and limited opportunities, particularly for the large and growing population of young people. The crisis highlights the need to bring together political, security and development dimensions and expand joint activities across this vast area of Africa. Activities and policies that foster social cohesion and sustain peace, transform economies, improve living standards and give young people hope must come from local, national and regional stakeholders, assisted by external partners as needed.\n\nFAO, UNICEF & WFP Sahel - Early action and scale-up of emergency response, March 2018 12\n\nMap 4 Situation of acute malnutrition for lean season 2018\n\nSource: CILSS, March 2018\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 928\n\nPOPULATION DISPLACEMENT TRENDS\n\nAs of June 2018, there were over 70 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, representing an increase of more than 5 million since the beginning of the year mainly as a result of conflict and insecurity.17 Most are displaced within their own countries.18 More than eight in 10 are in developing countries.19\n\nGlobally there were around 20.2 million refugees by June 2018, with most of them located in Europe (32 percent, including 18 percent in Turkey alone), Africa (30 percent), Asia and the Pacific (21 percent), and the Middle-East and North Africa (14 percent). The major source countries were the Syrian Arab Republic, Afghanistan, South Sudan, Myanmar, Somalia, the Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Eritrea, and Burundi. The 10 main recipient countries host 62 percent of the worldwide refugee population registered by UNHCR, of which eight are covered in this report as they had large numbers of food-insecure people in need of urgent assistance. In addition, there were 3.2 million pending asylum requests in mid 2018.20\n\nIn the first half of 2018, there were reportedly 555 800 newly displaced refugees at the global level. Most were fleeing violence and insecurity in the Syrian Arab Republic, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, the Central African Republic, the Sudan and Eritrea. The largest number of arrivals were reported in Turkey, Uganda, the Sudan, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Jordan, Chad and the Niger. In addition, one million people had requested asylum in another countries, with most of them fleeing Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Afghanistan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Iraq, El Salvador, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Honduras.21\n\nAs of mid-2018, there were nearly 40 million people internally displaced by conflict, insecurity and violence at the global level, according to UNHCR. The largest population of violence or insecurity-related IDPs were hosted in the Syrian Arab Republic, The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia, Yemen, Iraq, the Sudan, Afghanistan, Nigeria, South Sudan, Ukraine and Ethiopia.\n\nUNHCR mid-year trends 2018 18 UNHCR 19 Ibid 20 All from UNHCR Mid-year trends, 2018 21 Ibid 17\n\nThis corresponds to an increase of more than half a million IDPs during the first six months of 2018, with the largest increases in the Syrian Arab Republic, Somalia, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan.\n\nIn many countries displaced people are more vulnerable to food insecurity and malnutrition since they have lost their livelihoods and are often living in over-crowded conditions with poor sanitation and water access, and without the support of their extended families/ communities. For instance, in Afghanistan, millions have abandoned their rural homes and moved to cities in 2018 - most fleeing the drought-hit rural areas of Badghis, Ghor and Herat for provincial capitals. High levels of food insecurity and acute malnutrition were noted among IDP populations.\n\nIn some countries host communities are just as vulnerable as IDPs - or more so. In Uganda, which hosts more than 1.2 million refugees, mostly from South Sudan, as well as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi, the sustained influx of refugees has put substantial pressure on the environment and on the resources of host communities. Both refugees and host communities lack income-generating opportunities, and access to water, cultivable land, and markets.\n\nIn Cox's Bazar the influx of refugees has aggravated the already-fragile situation of one of the poorest and most vulnerable districts in Bangladesh and the host populations face higher levels of food insecurity than the Rohingya refugees from Myanmar. Many have lost access to farm lands, fishing grounds and forest resources and have been deprived of their livelihoods. Many of them have been compelled to work as wage labourers, but the availability of cheaper refugee labour has made jobs scarce and pushed down daily wage rates. They also face diminished access to basic services, and an increase in staple food prices because of higher demand.\n\nThe situation in Colombia, which is both a transit and destination country for Venezuelans crossing the border, is of particular concern. According to the 2019 HNO, 5.1 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance.22 In addition to the migrants from Venezuela and Colombian returnees, Colombia still has 487 000 vulnerable people displaced by decades of armed conflict within the country.\n\nOCHA. Colombia. HNO 2019 22\n\nADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF\n\nTHOSE ON THE CUSP OF CRISIS\n\nThe GRFC 2019 shows that major food crises are often characterized not only by persistent levels of acute food insecurity (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above), but also by large and persistent segments of populations on the edge of acute food insecurity - in Stressed (IPC/CH Phase 2). This report highlights that for the 42 countries where data is available, 143 million people were in Stressed (IPC/CH Phase 2) food insecurity conditions while 91.4 million people were in Crisis or worse in these same 42 countries. The large number on the cusp of Crisis conditions has changed very little over time.\n\nHouseholds in this phase have minimal adequate food consumption and cannot afford to access certain essential needs without engaging in coping strategies that undermine their food insecurity or ability to recover, such as compromising their food intake or selling their productive assets. Therefore, they may slip into IPC/ CH Phase 3 or above if an additional shock or stressor occurs. Although the main focus of this report is on populations in IPC/CH Phase 3 or above, it is also important to consider and act upon those in Stressed (IPC/CH Phase 2).\n\nFor instance, in Somalia despite the sustained humanitarian assistance, which prevented deepening food insecurity in 2017, the number of people in IPC/CH Phase 3 or above remained significant. In addition, large segments of the population - around 3 million people - have remained constantly in IPC/CH Phase 2 since 2016. Or in Afghanistan, where significant population levels were classified in IPC/CH Phase 2, fluctuating between 6 and almost 10 million people between 2014 and 2018.\n\nWhile humanitarian assistance is required to save lives and livelihoods in a timely manner (particularly in IPC/CH Phase 3 or above), long-term and resiliencebased interventions are important to reduce structural vulnerabilities and address root causes of hunger for those in Stressed food security conditions, allowing not only to reduce the number of people in IPC/CH Phase 3 or above, but also to prevent other households from falling into Crisis or worse. All actors investing in resilience programming need to have the capacity to be able to absorb additional numbers as populations move back and forth between IPC/CH Phases 2 and 3 (Stressed and Crisis).\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 930\n\nVenezuela is undergoing a political and economic crisis. Most of the food supply is imported, but the collapse in the value of the local Bolivar currency is resulting in difficulties in importing food. In 2016-2017, food imports fell by 67 percent.1 Hyperinflation has severely reduced the purchasing power of households, limiting access to food, as well as medicine and other basic goods.\n\nAccording to the \"Encuesta Nacional de Condiciones de Vida de la Población Venezolana (ENCOVI)\", in 2017, 87 percent of households surveyed were considered to be poor, up from 48 percent in 2014 and the percentage of households in extreme poverty rose from\n\nENCOVI 2017: Radiography of the Venezuelan 1\n\nEconomic shock and population displacement Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)\n\n24 percent in 2014 to 61 percent in 2017.2 Surveys conducted by local organizations point to an increasingly dire humanitarian situation as the political crisis deepens the four-year economic crisis.3 However, the number of people in need of urgent assistance and the severity of their needs in 2018 were unclear because of the absence of reliable data at the time.\n\nAmong the effects of the crisis, a large influx of refugees is entering neighbouring countries. It is estimated that the number of Venezuelans in countries across Latin America rose from 700 000 in 2015 to over 3.4 million in December 2018.4 Colombia hosts the highest number - a total of over ENCOVI 2017: Radiography of the Venezuelan Crisis 3 ACAPS. thematic report 23 May 2018 4 UNHCR. https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations 2\n\n© U\n\nN IC\n\nEF\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 31\n\n1.1 million, followed by Peru, with over half a million; Ecuador, over 221 000; Argentina, 130 000; Chile, over 100 000 and Brazil, 96 000. The total number of Venezuelans in the region is likely to be higher, as most data sources do not account for those without regular status.5\n\nMigrants often lack the economic resources to buy food. According to WFP, 30 percent of migrant in Colombia are moderately or severely food insecure. In Ecuador the percentage is 38 percent and in Peru 14 percent.6 In some areas displaced people are homeless and sleeping out in the open or in overcrowded https://s3.amazonaws.com/unhcrsharedmedia/2018/RMRP_ Venezuela_2019_OnlineVersion.pdf 6 WFP EFSA. 2018 using CARI 5 camps where WASH and health services are insufficient. Emergency coping strategies include survival sex, prostitution and child labour. Armed groups often restrict access for humanitarian organizations, particularly in the border region of Colombia. Sources indicate that migration from Venezuela to countries in the region is drastically increasing because of the deepening crisis, which will place additional pressure on overstretched host communities.7 Many Venezuelans arrive in need of health and nutrition assistance, overwhelming local response capacities, particularly in border regions.\n\nACAPS.

Of the 51 million children wasted, 16.4 million were severely wasted. This marks a slight improvement since 2016 when nearly 52 million children under five (7.7 percent) were acutely malnourished and 17 million severely wasted. However, it is still a far cry from the internationally agreed global nutrition target to reduce and maintain childhood wasting to below five percent by 2025. Stunting24 affected almost 151 million, or 22.2 percent, of children under five.\n\nThe high levels of acute malnutrition and stunting among children in emergency contexts remained a concern in 2018. The analyses in this report demonstrate that acute malnutrition significantly worsened between 2017 and 2018 in areas of Afghanistan, South Sudan, north-east Nigeria, the Niger, Yemen and the Syrian Arab Republic (Eastern Ghouta, Ar Raqqa and Idlib). For instance, In South Sudan in the lead-up to the lean season of May- July 2018, the UNICEF/WHO/World Bank Group.

Four counties were expected to have GAM levels at 30 percent or above, while most counties in the Greater Upper Nile, Northern Bahr-el-Ghazal, Warrap and parts of Eastern Equatoria were expected to reach very high levels.25\n\nAcross the six countries of the Sahel region (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, the Niger and Senegal), which experienced severe rainfall deficits in tandem with insecurity, up to 1.6 million children were reported at risk of suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM), an increase of more than 50 percent since 2017, and 3.4 million from moderate acute malnutrition (MAM),26 with the highest rates in Mauritania, Mali and the Niger.\n\nRates of moderate and severe acute malnutrition remained extremely concerning in the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya's drought-affected arid and semiarid districts, half of all provinces in Chad, south and southeastern Madagascar, Somalia, the Sudan and northern Uganda (Karamoja and northwestern districts).\n\nIPC.

Presentation at the PREGEC meeting, 25\n\nAbidjan 19-21 Novembre 2018\n\nDesigning actions that result in impact is impossible without adequate knowledge of who is affected by malnutrition, where and why. Gaps in nutrition, health, WASH and food security data availability occur for varied and interlinked reasons: inadequate access to the affected population because of security concerns, lack of financial and technical resources to conduct timely assessments, lack of alignment within sectors to collect data to support analysis of the drivers and the rapid situational changes in conflict-affected regions.\n\nIn recent years progress has been made by governments, international organizations, research organizations and academic institutions in gathering, collating and analysing data to help inform the nutrition response. Still more regular, detailed and disaggregated data is\n\nREGULAR, DETAILED AND DISAGGREGATED NUTRITION DATA IS NEEDED needed. National averages do not adequately reflect nutritional requirements within regions in a country, particularly in a context where conflicts and droughts are localized and concentrated.\n\nCollecting and analysing data on nutritionally vulnerable populations - such as women, adolescent girls, young children and people who are marginalised and geographically isolated - is a vital exercise. Data availability allows for a systematic and integrated nutrition situation analysis that identifies not only outcomes but also key drivers of malnutrition for a targeted and integrated response. But data collection and analysis is not enough: all stakeholders need the capacity to access and use the information to make evidence-based decisions. The data community must make the data easy to interpret by policymakers and relevant stakeholders.\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 33\n\nSub-Saharan Africa...\n\nSouth Asia...\n\nLatin America and the Caribbean...\n\nNorth America...\n\n59.4 million 27.0 million 57.9 million 13.1 million 7.4 million 3.7 million 0.5 million 0.1 million Eastern Europe and Central Asia...\n\n1.8 million 0.4 million 5.1 million 0.7 million 14.0 million 4.7 millionMiddle East and North Africa...\n\nEast Asia and the Pacific...\n\nThese new estimates supersede former analyses and results published by UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank Group.\n\nSTUNTED 151 million WASTED 51 million Stunting affected an estimated 22.2 per cent or 150.8 million children under 5 globally in 2017.\n\nIn 2017, wasting continued to threaten the lives of an estimated 7.5 per cent or 50.5 million children under 5 globally.\n\nOf that 50.5 million, 17 million were severely wasted\n\nSEVERELY W ASTED m illion 17\n\nTHE GLOBAL BURDEN OF UNDERNUTRITIONFigure 9 The global burden of undernutrition\n\nSource: UNICEF, WHO & World Bank, Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates - Levels and Trends, May 2018\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 934\n\nLimited access to nutritious foods for young children in crises In food crises, when food production and distribution systems are disrupted and purchasing power is weakened, mothers and caregivers can face major challenges in providing children with the key micronutrients they need at critical growth periods. This is reflected in the dismally low number of children consuming a minimum acceptable diet in most of the countries profiled in this report: in Ethiopia, The Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Niger's Diffa region, the makeshift camps for Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, Zimbabwe, Somalia and Malawi, fewer than 10 percent of children between 6-23 months of age were receiving a diet that met the minimum nutritional requirements for adequate growth and development.\n\nDiminished access to basic services and higher disease burden in crises People are often forced to live in overcrowded, unhygienic settings where they are at increased risk of frequent outbreaks of infectious diseases. Displaced populations in many of the crisis-affected countries covered in this report face severely compromised access to safe water and improved sanitation. Lack of access to safe drinking water is particularly poor in the Lac region of Chad (95 percent) and the Central African Republic (70 percent) followed by Madagascar, Kenya, The Democratic Republic of the Congo, north-east Nigeria, Far North Cameroon, Mozambique, Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n\nIn crises health systems may be weakened or even cease to function, trained medical staff may not be available and life-saving medication can become very expensive or unobtainable. In these situations, children have limited access to micronutrient supplementation, and to immunization programmes. Families do not receive basic health services for disease treatment and children are at increased risk of frequent outbreaks of infectious diseases.\n\nIn Afghanistan, Lake Chad basin, The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ukraine, South Sudan and Ethiopia conflict and instability disrupted basic health and nutrition services in 2018. In Yemen less than half of health facilities were functioning.\n\nIn 2018 there were outbreaks of cholera (Cameroon, the Niger, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zimbabwe), polio (Somalia), measles (Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Madagascar) and Ebola (the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Acute Watery Diarrhoea was commonplace among displaced communities.\n\nChild feeding and care practices can be compromised in crises Displacement can result in the break-down of familial and community networks that can provide the necessary support and guidance needed for looking after young children, including their nutritional requirements. Furthermore, the trauma and stress induced by frequent displacement can reduce people's ability to care for themselves and their families with serious negative ramifications for the ability of parents and caregivers to create a nourishing environment for young children. In countries like Chad, high rates of psychological trauma and the lack of socio-affective stimulation between children and caretakers have been identified as aggravating factors for children's malnutrition.\n\nBreastfeeding practices can be influenced negatively in emergencies when mothers and young children are on the move or in temporary shelters and/or when support from health facilities and communities are not available. Without adequate support, mothers may believe that the stress and trauma caused by displacement, along with their inadequate diets, may decrease the production and quality of their breast milk, which might lead them to feed their babies in unsuitable ways compromising the health and nutrition status of children. Children who are bottle fed and/or given infant formula or other forms of powdered milk in unhygienic circumstances have an increased risk of illness. In situations when infants cannot be breastfed, there needs to be access to safe breastmilk substitutes that can be prepared in a hygienic way.\n\nThis report shows very low rates of exclusive breastfeeding in Yemen (10 percent); Chad's Lac region (11 percent); north-east Nigeria (21 percent); the Syrian Arab Republic (24 percent); Iraq (26 percent); the Central African Republic (29 percent); and Cameroon's Far North (31 percent).\n\nMothers may have limited time to adequately prepare and care for younger children. For example, the death of family members, changes in livelihood activities or increased economic pressure can force women to become heads of households and take responsibility for vulnerable family members, thereby reducing the time they have to care for the younger children.\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 35\n\nThe first 1000 days of life - roughly spanning from conception to a child's second birthday - is a critical period for growth and development; consequently, optimal nutrition is essential in these early days for children to reach their full potential.\n\nAppropriate breastfeeding practices, such as early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, and the timely introduction of safe and nutritionally adequate complementary foods, with continued breastfeeding up to two years of age or beyond, ensure that children consume a diet meeting\n\nSPECIAL FOCUS ON INFANT AND YOUNG CHILD FEEDING (IYCF) IN EMERGENCIES their minimum nutrient requirements for healthy growth and development. Appropriate IYCF practices also boost immunity to diseases and infections. Generally, the main bottlenecks to appropriate IYCF practices for children under two years include inadequate community and health system support for mothers to practise appropriate feeding; negative beliefs and practices; and lack of access to nutritious foods. As discussed above, in emergency contexts these vulnerabilities increase, putting children at a much higher risk of consuming inadequate diets.\n\nSource: IFE Core Group, ENN (2017).

In the first nine months of 2018, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) recorded the highest number of civilian deaths (2 798) from armed conflict since the same period in 2014.1 A quarter of the labour force is unemployed, 80 percent of employment is vulnerable and insecure and more than half (54 percent) of the population lives below the national poverty line.2 Given this underlying fragility - at the economic, political and security levels - the country cannot cope with the consequences of the recurrent natural disasters which affect an average of 200 000 people each year.3\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY OVERVIEW\n\nThe number of rural Afghans facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) was projected to reach 10.6 million (47 percent of the rural population) in the winter months (November 2018-February 2019) if urgent food assistance was not provided. Of these, 2.9 million were expected to face Emergency (IPC Phase 4) if they did not receive support. In addition, 6.8 million people were expected to face Stressed (IPC Phase 2) during the same period.\n\nThis marks an increase compared with August-October 2018 when 9.8 million rural Afghans (44 percent of the rural population) were estimated to be in IPC Phase 3 or above while the number of people in IPC Phase 2 persisted.\n\nEven though the 2017 versus 2018 numbers are not directly comparable (the 2018 IPC analysed the rural population of Afghanistan and the 2017 both urban and rural), they confidently support a significant year-on-year deterioration in the food security situation linked to the 2018 drought. The number of people in IPC Phase 3 or above grew from 7.6 million nationally from August- November 2017 to 9.8 million4 in rural areas during the same period in 2018.\n\nUNAMA, Protection of civilians in armed conflict. 3rd quarter report. 10 October 2018 2 World Bank blog: the latest poverty numbers for Afghanistan: a call to action, not a reason for despair, July 2018 3 OCHA Afghanistan: overview of natural disasters (March 2019) 4 The 2018 IPC analysed the rural population of Afghanistan while 1 the 2017 analysed both urban and rural. If the urban population had been taken into account, the number of people in IPC Phase 3 or above would have been the same or slightly higher depending on how the drought conditions affected the urban population and would still result in a deterioration in food security\n\n© F\n\nA O\n\n/A FG\n\nH A\n\nN IS\n\nTA N\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 940\n\nDrought conditions worsened in the first half of 2018, following a winter period during which only 30 percent of necessary rainfall fell across most of the country, diminishing water availability for irrigation and affecting the wheat planting season for a fifth year in a row.\n\nDuring the main cereal post-harvest period (July- August 2018), drought conditions were most severe in the western, northern and southern regions.8 The lack of water had a dramatic effect because local coping capacities were severely depleted by decades of conflict and the ability to deliver aid was highly constrained by the intensification of violence. The majority of households resorted to emergency livelihood coping strategies such as moving to cities (many people fleeing FAO and World Food Programme. Joint Emergency Food Security Assessment. October 2018 8 the hard-hit rural areas of Badghis, Ghor and Herat to provincial capitals of Badghis and Herat), distress-selling of breeding livestock and consuming seeds saved for the next season, thus reducing next season's planted areas and compromising their ability to deal with future shocks.9\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock estimates national wheat production to be 28 percent below the five-year average and a deficit for the 2017/2018 main cropping season of 2-2.5 million tonnes.10 Preliminary production estimates indicated that the 2018 wheat harvest would be the lowest since 2011.11 Livestock farmers faced extensive drying of pastureland, and almost half (48 percent) of pastoralists reported reduced livestock productivity and an increase in animal deaths.\n\nFAO.

Across the year around 343 000 Afghans were newly displaced because of conflict.12 Constrained humanitarian access hindered assessments, preventing verification of the full extent of displacement and undermining the provision of assistance and services.13\n\nBetween January and November, over 258 000 people were displaced by natural disasters throughout the country with 26 out of 34 provinces experiencing either drought, floods, earthquakes or landslides). OCHA's July- September 2018 bulletin reported that despite increased efforts of humanitarian partners, living conditions for families displaced by the drought in Herat City remained harsh as winter approached,14 with many having run out of in-kind food rations and used their cash-for-food to pay debts or for health services, or bought material for shelters.\n\nThe repatriation of Afghanis from neighbouring countries continued. There were over 800 000 undocumented Afghan returnees from Pakistan and Iran in 2018.15 There has been a massive increase in undocumented returns from Iran in particular, largely driven by recent political and economic issues in Iran, including massive currency devaluation.16 Many of the returnees are highly vulnerable to food insecurity as they have no livelihoods or assets. These returns have also put an end to the remittances that the former migrant workers used to send home.\n\nNUTRITION OVERVIEW The most recent national nutrition survey (2013) estimated that 9.5 percent of children under five years were wasted (GAM), four percent severely so, and 41 percent stunted.17 However, the malnutrition situation generally worsened in most provinces in 2018 according to provincial level assessments. The results indicate acute UNHCR 2018.i 13 OCHA Afghanistan, conflict induced displacements 14 OCHA Afghanistan Humanitarian Bulletin Issue 78, 1 July - 30 12\n\nSeptember 2018 15 IOM, December 2018 16 IOM Weekly Situation Report, 9-15 September 2018 17 National Nutrition Survey Afghanistan 2013 malnutrition levels above emergency thresholds in 2218 out of 34 provinces.19 The levels of acute malnutrition were highest in the drought-affected provinces of Jawzjan (27.4 percent), Kandahar (22.3 percent), and Badghis (19.7 percent). High levels of acute malnutrition were also noted among IDPs: a rapid assessment in Herat indicated a GAM rate of 24 percent among long-term IDPs and 25 percent among the new IDPs.20\n\nThis translates to an estimated two million children - or four out of 10 - being acutely malnourished and in need of immediate treatment. Out of these an estimated 600 000 children were severely acutely malnourished, around half of them IDPs, returnees or living in rapid-onset disaster-affected communities. These numbers indicate an increase from 2017 when 1.6 million children were acutely malnourished, 546 000 of them severely so.\n\nAlmost half a million (485 000) pregnant and lactating women were acutely malnourished and required care in 2018, an increase of 42 000 since the previous year. The key drivers of deteriorating nutrition in Afghanistan are increasing food insecurity, especially in the droughtaffected provinces, coupled with a constrained health system. Limited access to clean water (39 percent use unimproved sources) and sanitation (43 percent have unimproved sanitation) increase the risk of child morbidity and recurrent infections.21\n\nOverall, 30 percent of Afghans lack access to basic health services with people living in hard-to-reach districts most likely to be deprived of essential primary health services. Almost four in 10 health facilities do not provide services for the management of SAM. Vaccination coverage in hard-to-reach districts, such as Uruzgan, is now as low as 32 per cent. Drought-affected people are particularly prone to disease including acute watery diarrhoea (AWD), and respiratory and skin infections because of the lack of safe water. Almost half (48 percent) of droughtdisplaced households report cases of AWD.22\n\nPoor infant and young child feeding practices and micronutrient deficiencies further exacerbate the poor nutritional status of vulnerable children.\n\nThe 22 provinces are: Badakhshan, Badghis, Bamyan, Dykundi, Farah, Faryab, Ghazni, Ghor, Hilmand, Jawzjan, Kandahar, Khost, Kunar, Nangarhar, Nuristan, Paktika, Paktya, Parwan, Takhar, Uruzgan, Wardak and Zabul 19 Afghanistan HNO 2019 20 OCHA.

Assistance is mainly provided in the form of food rations although food vouchers are being scaledup.29\n\nWFP Rohingya Refugee Emergency Food Security Update December 2018 29 b a n g l a d e s h c o x ' s b a z a r\n\nSince 25 August 2017, over 738 000 Rohingya refugees23 escaping violence and persecution in Myanmar have settled in camps, settlements and within host communities in Cox's Bazar district, Bangladesh, bringing the total number of refugees in the area to nearly 907 000 by December 2018, which is more than three times the number of the host population in the district.24 The growing refugee population has had a heavy impact on the lives and livelihoods of the local populations in Ukhiya and Teknaf upazilas - already among the poorest in Bangladesh.\n\nIn 2018, almost 1.3 million people were food insecure in Cox's Bazar.25 Trends of food security indicators, as shown by WFP's May-June and August-September monitoring rounds suggest that overall food security among the Rohingya refugee population has improved since the 2017 Refugee Influx Emergency Vulnerability Assessment (REVA) baseline. This is likely thanks to regular and effective general food assistance through in-kind and voucher programmes on which the refugee population is almost 100 percent reliant.\n\nA comparison between the 2017 REVA and the latest monitoring round in 2018 (August-September) showed that 91 percent of displaced households were able to maintain or improve their food consumption status.26 However, food security for host communities showed a marked deterioration, with the percentage of households with poor/borderline food consumption increasing sharply from 31 percent in 2017 to 80 percent by August- September 2018.\n\nWhile displaced households registered a more diverse diet during August-September than at baseline as a result of receiving vouchers and sustained food assistance, the dietary diversity of host community households decreased.27\n\nNearly seven in 10 refugee households borrowed money to meet their food needs in August-September 2018.28 They have also become increasingly likely to sell food\n\nUNHCR Bangladesh Operation Update, 15-31 December 2018 24 Ibid 25 2018 Humanitarian Crisis JRP for Rohingya March-December 2018 26 WFP.

They face movement restrictions, protection issues in highly congested sites, and limited opportunities to earn money.\n\nBesides the general lack of jobs and access to incomegenerating activities and land for food production, lack of firewood, which is used as the main cooking fuel by nearly all displaced households, and the protection risks of collecting it (particularly for children), constrain food access for refugee families, according to WFP monitoring.\n\nTo complicate an already critical situation, the monsoon and cyclone season (May-September) poses an additional threat to the nearly one million households at risk of landslides and flooding. The Kutupalong-Balukhali expansion site camp is the largest and most densely populated refugee camp in the world with a population of 628 000 and despite significant work to improve the site it's unlikely to withstand a direct hit from a cyclone.30 Market access is particularly constrained during monsoon floods/heavy rains and landslides and because of a perception of greater violence and insecurity. After the monsoon higher food prices curtail purchasing power.31\n\nMedicins Sans Frontieres August 2018 31 WFP Rohingha Refugee Emergency food security update December 30\n\nMap 7 Bangladesh, Cox's Bazar, refugee population density\n\nSource: UNHCR, January 2019\n\nBlue ball including number = number of refugees by camp/site Note 1 Kutupalong RC includes 14,277 registered refugees of 2,617 families & Nayapara RC includes 19,895 registered refugees of 3,704 families; Note 2 This map does not include 4,818 refugees residing outside formal camp / camp boundaries Disclaimer The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 45\n\nThe influx of refugees has aggravated the already fragile situation of one of the poorest and most vulnerable districts in Bangladesh, where most local households derive their livelihoods from farming plots of around a hectare or less and/or fishing. Many have lost access to previously farmed lands. Between August 2017 and March 2018, at least 100 hectares of crop land in Teknaf and Ukhiya have been damaged by refugee activities, either occupied by refugee settlements or rendered useless by sandy soil flowing down from the mountain slopes, which are being used for refugee housing.32\n\nLocal farmers in Teknaf and Ukhiya have always faced a lack of fresh water for agricultural production. However, fecal contamination levels in the affected areas has intensified scarcity of clean water for cooking and normal daily hygiene, while the population increase has massively increased overall demand for fresh water.\n\nIn many cases, those who earned a living from forest resources have been deprived of their livelihood. Reportedly, almost 2 000 hectares of forest reserves have been destroyed. Around 750 000 kg of timber, vegetation and roots are collected daily from the forest for cooking fuel.33\n\nSince the crisis escalated in August 2017, a ban has been in place on fishing in the Naf River for security and border control reasons. This prohibition has placed significant pressure on an estimated 30 000 to 35 000 fishermen and their families. Many of them have been compelled to work as wage labourers, but the availability of cheaper refugee labour has made jobs scarce and pushed down daily wage rates.\n\nThese factors along with diminished access to basic services, and an increase in staple food prices because of higher demand could represent the main factors behind the fall in acceptable food consumption levels among host communities over the last year.\n\nOCHA Joint Response Plan for Rohingya humanitarian crisis January-December 2019 33 Ibid 32\n\nThe acute malnutrition rate is below the WHO emergency threshold of >15 percent, according to the SMART nutrition surveys conducted among Rohingya women and children living in camps in Ukhia and Teknaf Upazilas in October/November 2018.34 The findings indicated a decline in GAM rates in makeshift camps from 19.3 percent in October/November 2017 to 11 percent. The SAM rate decreased from three percent to two percent in the same timeframe. In Nayapara Registered Camp (NRC) GAM fell from 14.3 percent to 12.2 percent.\n\nAnaemia among children aged 6-23 months was greater than 30 percent and stunting among children 0-59 months was greater than 40 percent: both remain major concerns.\n\nPoor dietary diversity is a major contributor to malnutrition in the camps. Only 7.3 percent of children (aged 6-23 months) in the makeshift camps and 29.7 percent in NRC were reported to have received minimum acceptable diets. Sub optimal infant and young child feeding practices are reported with almost half of infants under six months in makeshift camps, and just over a quarter in NRC, not exclusively breastfed. One in every four children had an episode of diarrhoea two weeks before the October/November assessment - an indication that inadequate sanitary conditions remain a serious underlying risk to children's health and nutrition status in the crowded camps.\n\nOCHA Emergency Nutrition Assessment round 3 OctoberNovember 2018 34\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 946\n\n• Erratic rains, pest attacks, high winds and hail resulted in localized crop production shortfalls.\n\n• IDPs and returnees have few assets and live in drought-and floodprone communes, straining fragile host communities.

About 140 000 people remained internally displaced in 2018, mainly because of climatic events (77 percent) followed by socio-political reasons (23 percent).39\n\nThe most food-insecure areas tend to be in the Dépressions de l'Est and Buragane livelihood zones bordering the United Republic of Tanzania, where Burundian refugees are being assisted to return from the United Republic of Tanzania at an average rate of 3 800 per month.40 From January to 30 September 2018 a total of 38 390 refugees were assisted to voluntarily repatriate to Burundi from the United Republic of Tanzania.41 As of December, the total of voluntary returns in 2018 almost reached 58 000,42 while an unspecified number repatriated on their own. Registered and non-registered returnees alike have difficulty re-establishing their livelihoods and obtaining agricultural inputs, particularly if they arrive after the start of a season.43 According to monitoring by UNHCR and Caritas 70 percent of these returnees had only one meal a day.44\n\nBurundi is also receiving refugees and asylum-seekers originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo fleeing violence and armed conflict in South Kivu. Approximately 41 percent are living in urban areas, while the remaining 59 percent are living in four refugee camps. By the end of 2018 UNHCR estimated there were around 76 000 Congolese refugees in the country.45\n\nStable food prices made food more accessible during the October-December lean period than during the same period last year. According to the Burundi Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (ISTEEBU), national staple food prices in October declined by 2.7 percent compared to September, which is seasonally atypical given the lesser availability of food supplies during the lean season.46\n\nMultiple structural problems underlie chronic food insecurity in Burundi.

According to the February-March 2018 National Nutritional and Mortality Survey (NNMS) based on SMART methodology,48 six of Burundi's 18 provinces had a GAM prevalence of 5-9.5 percent, compared with nine provinces in the IPC acute malnutrition analysis for October-December 2017.49\n\nAround 115 000 children were expected to suffer from acute malnutrition according to the latest 2018 survey, slightly less than the 125 000 estimated in the IPC analysis, which found that Karusi, Kayanza, and Kirundo provinces required particular attention. The prevalence of chronic malnutrition is 57 percent, the highest rate in Africa.50\n\nMajor contributing factors to acute malnutrition are food insecurity and poor child feeding practices. The 2018 NNMS found just 29 percent of children aged 6-23 months received a minimum acceptable diet.51 Relatively high prevalence of diseases (particularly malaria), and low access to health facilities, clean water and sanitation also contribute to malnutrition. Two in three children were ill in the 15 days before the 2018 NNMS survey. Anaemia is a major public health problem that calls for urgent attention in all provinces.\n\nOn the upside there was a sharp fall in malaria cases and deaths in the first six months of 2018 thanks to increased efforts of health partners and donors contributing to the Malaria Response Plan. According to the Ministry of Health, the cumulative number of malaria cases reported during the first 24 weeks of 2018 was 2.4 million, 44 percent lower than the same period in 2017.52\n\nFAO December 2017 48 ISTEB.

The crisis is driven largely by fighting between about 12 armed groups over cattle routes and lands rich in diamonds, gold and uranium. The groups target civilians and attack health and education facilities and personnel, mosques and churches, as well as sites where displaced people have sought shelter and protection.53 The majority of the population does not have access to clean water, three quarters lack access to basic sanitation and an estimated three out of four live on less than 1.90 USD a day, up from two out of three a decade ago.54 The country ranks out 189 in the 2018 Humanitarian Development Index.55 188\n\nIn August 2018 the number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) amounted to 1.89 million - or 43 percent of the population. Of these, about 550 000 people faced Emergency (IPC Phase 4) conditions.56 An additional 1.8 million people were estimated to be in Stressed (IPC Phase 2). This marks a deterioration compared to 2017. Since late 2017, the quantity of the food intake for large segments of the population reportedly reduced and dietary diversity drastically worsened through the substitution of more nutritious cereals and vegetables with cassava.57\n\nThe areas with the highest levels of food insecurity included the concentrations of Batangafo, Kaga Bandoro and Rafai and the prefectures of Ouham Pendé, NanaGribizi, Ouaka and Haut-Mbomou.58\n\nIn March 2018, before the start of the lean season, already 1.6 million were facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or above. Between March and August 2018 food insecurity worsened, particularly in the prefectures worst-affected by the conflict, including Haut-Mbomou, Nana-Grebizi, Ouaka and Ouham Pendé, where it deteriorated from Crisis to Emergency levels.\n\nUNICEF November 2018 54 Ibid 55 UNDP 2018 Humanitarian Development Index Ranking 56 IPC République Centrafricaine.

Increasing tensions and violence since the beginning of 2018 are now engulfing the country, including several major towns and cities. In 2018 the capital Bangui experienced its highest levels of violence in at least two years.59 Armed groups now control four-fifths of the country.60 According to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), the total number of fatalities was lower in 2018 than 2017, but the level of violence against civilians was 12 percent higher.61\n\nUNICEF.

People have abandoned their farms and armed gangs have often looted crops. Despite favourable weather conditions, crop prospects for 2018 - estimated at three percent below the 2017 production levels - were below-average and significantly below the pre-crisis levels.63\n\nIntercommunal conflict between farmers and nomadic pastoralists in the border areas with Cameroon, Chad, FEWS NET.

Households, therefore, depleted their food stocks, inflating prices, and compelling nearly half to adopt negative coping mechanisms.64\n\nInsecurity, lack of transportation, degradation of roads, and illegal taxes imposed by armed groups disrupt food and livestock markets, especially in northwest, southeast and central conflict-affected areas, undermining food access.65 As of June, the prices of staples were above their December 2017 levels: the maize price was 52 percent higher, sorghum 17 percent higher and local rice 14 percent higher. According to WFP's Alert for Price Spikes, the Bria market was in alert as a result of high maize prices and in stress as a result of high cassava prices.66 Prices were expected to seasonally decline in November thanks to availability of production from harvests.67\n\nConflict has pushed the number of internally displaced people up from about 400 000 in January 2017 to around 581 000 in December 2018, out of a total population of 4.7 million.68 In addition around 376 000 former IDPs and around 119 000 returnees from abroad69 have come back - often to find their houses burned or badly vandalised. Returnees urgently need support as their coping capacities have been exhausted and livelihoods lost.70\n\nAround Bria, the capital of Haute-Kotto, increasing numbers abandoned their homes in 2018 to seek refuge from abuses by armed groups and security forces, mainly in the PK3 site. By the end of September 2018, Bria was hosting around 94 000 displaced people compared to around 50 000 in August 2018, putting huge pressure on humanitarian assistance.71 IDPs live in 'concentrations' in the main cities of the prefectures affected by the conflict,72 most (60 percent) with host families. This adds pressure to the already precarious livelihoods of local host communities: in some prefectures, including Haute Kotto, IDPs outnumber their hosts.\n\nFAO situation report Oct 2018 65 FAO GIEWS.

The 40 percent who live in settlements endure dire living conditions and often have movement restrictions imposed on them by armed groups, preventing them from accessing agricultural fields and buying food.73\n\nAccording to existing SMART surveys, eight subprefectures (out of a total of 71) have very high GAM levels (> 15 percent). SAM rates are above two per cent in more than half the country (39 sub prefectures).74\n\nDisplaced children are particularly vulnerable to malnutrition. According to rapid surveys conducted in Ouaka, Haut-Mbomou and Basse-Kotte prefectures in 2017 and 2018, GAM rates are above the WHO emergency threshold (>15 percent) in 16 out of 18 displacement sites.75\n\nChronic malnutrition, measured by stunting, affects four in every 10 children under five years of age in the country, according to the latest national data.76 Currently, it is estimated that 350 000 children under five years of age are chronically malnourished.77 The rates are particularly concerning in the sub-prefectures of Mamberé-Kadéi and Sangha Mbaéré, where at least half of children under five are stunted.\n\nMalaria and acute diarrhoea are the main illnesses in children under five. Food insecurity remains a major challenge, particularly around main cities in prefectures touched by conflict with large numbers of displaced populations. Poor child feeding practices and low levels of exclusive breastfeeding for infants younger than six months old (less than 30 percent) are major contributory factors.78 Some 70 percent of the population lacks safe drinking water and hygiene and sanitation conditions are poor. Access to primary health services and nutrition support is limited because of interruptions to services, attacks on personnel, destruction of infrastructure and looting of medicines.\n\nFAO.

It is one of the most susceptible regions in the world to climate change and variability.79 The countries that are the most prone to drought and long periods of heatwaves during El Niño years, as well as extreme precipitation, are Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The frequency and intensity of droughts and floods has been increasing in recent years. Small producers of basic grain crops have very limited access to infrastructure and services and little resilience to climate shocks: more than half of the region's 45 million inhabitants live below the poverty line and 20 percent in extreme poverty.80\n\nBetween November 2018 and March 2019, around 1.6 million people were facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) food security conditions in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Around 2.5 million people were in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) conditions in these areas.\n\nIn Guatemala, approximately 838 000 people were food insecure and in need of urgent action (IPC Phase 3 or above).81 Honduras accounted for close to 519 000 people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) in the western region - in the departments of Copán, Lempira, Ocotepeque, and Santa Bárbara - and Fonseca Gulf - Choluteca, El Paraíso, Francisco Morazán, La Paz, and Valle.82 Additionally, around 219 000 people were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) in selected areas of El Salvador - in the departments of La Unión, Morazán, San Miguel, Usulután, Chalatenango (Cayaguanca) and Santa Ana (Candelaría).83\n\nFAO.

The resilience of smallholders was eroded by the cumulative impact of two consecutive reduced harvests in 2014 and 2015, following drought conditions associated with the El Niño phenomenon. Consequently the crop losses in 2018 had a severe impact on their livelihoods.\n\nPrevailing high cereal prices due to inflated production costs, mainly linked to elevated fuel prices, had a negative impact on food access for vulnerable households.\n\nIn Central America, there exists a 2-4 week dry period, called \"canícula\", during the July-August cropping season. 84 c e n t r a l a m e r i c a n d r y c o r r i d o r\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 956\n\nGUATEMALA (DRY CORRIDOR)\n\nIn Guatemala, where the first season harvest accounts for about 60 percent of the national yearly output of maize and 35 percent of the yearly output of beans, severe dryness prevailed in July in the East and Coastal regions. In the areas of the Dry Corridor lying in these regions, no rains were received up to mid-August, resulting in substantial crop losses. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food, the drought affected about one in 10 people nationally, with the areas of major concern being Jutiapa, Chiquimula, El Progreso, Jalapa and Baja Verapaz departments.\n\nAiming to support second season production, the government provided farmers with seeds, tools and small irrigation systems. In addition, food aid was distributed to the farmers who lost more than 75 percent of their expected harvest.85 Markets were adequately supplied thanks to the favourable harvest output in the northern producing region and imports from Mexico. However, prices of white maize in February were about 30 percent higher than year-earlier levels, constraining food access for vulnerable households.\n\nMinisterio de Agricultura, 2018 85\n\nMap 11 Central American Dry Corridor, IPC Acute food insecurity situation, November 2018-March 2019\n\nMap 12 Central American Dry Corridor, IPC Acute food insecurity situation, February-July 2019\n\nSource: El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala IPC Technical Working Groups\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 57\n\nHONDURAS (DRY CORRIDOR)\n\nIn 2018, the Primera and Postrera crop production cycles had lower than normal yields mainly because of the prolonged drought in June and August followed by excessive rainfall in October.86 According to a Government of Honduras survey, the season A maize crop was 17 percent of expected levels and the beans crop 15 percent because of the drought. As production of first season maize represents 80 percent of the total annual production, while that of beans represents 20 percent, the drought had a comparatively greater impact on the domestic availability of maize. The areas most affected by the drought were Choluteca, Valle, El Paraíso, Francisco Morazán, La Paz and Lempira departments, lying in the Dry Corridor, where around 82 percent of both crops were lost. By contrast, crop losses in the rest of the country were estimated at 10 percent.\n\nAs the Dry Corridor area accounts for about 10 percent of the annual aggregated maize output, localized crop losses did not significantly reduce availabilities at the national level. However, they severely affected local livelihoods, and the households in the Dry Corridor, mainly smallholder farmers, had to rely on markets, facing high maize prices as in other countries of the region. To mitigate these severe food availability and access constraints, the government distributed food aid to the affected households, about 10 percent of the national population. To improve the resilience of the farming households in the Dry Corridor, the government is seeking to expand irrigation use by repairing the rainwater harvesting facilities that were already established in the region.87\n\nEL SALVADOR (DRY CORRIDOR)\n\nSince 2014 most of the Dry Corridor of El Salvador has been affected consecutively by irregularities in the distribution of rain, causing periods of prolonged drought and a progressive deterioration of the livelihoods of the affected population.88 According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, the drought-related crop losses in the 2018 Primera main season amounted to 46 000 tonnes,89 about six percent of the expected output of the season, which normally accounts for about 85 percent of the yearly national maize production.\n\nThe areas most affected by the drought were Usulután, San Vicente, San Miguel, La Unión and Morazán\n\nIPC Informe del análisis de inseguridad alimentaria aguda - Situación actual, región 13 Golfo de Fonseca, Honduras, 14 December 2018; IPC Informe del análisis de inseguridad alimentaria aguda - Situación actual 87 El Heraldo, 16 February, 2019 88 IPC Informe de análisis de inseguridad alimentaria aguda -Situación 86\n\nActual,Región Oriental, El Salvador. 27 November 2018 89 La Prensa Grafica, 26 September 2018 departments in the eastern region. Although some of these departments produce more maize in the following Postrera season, the production shortfalls had a severe impact on the livelihoods of smallholder farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture. Subsequently, excessive rainfall in early October resulted in the loss of 10 230 tonnes of Postrera season crops, harvested in November-December, despite the efforts of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock to boost production by distributing maize seeds. As household stocks of maize were depleted earlier than usual in the drought-affected areas, populations in the Dry Corridor had to rely on market purchases. They faced high prices: in February 2019, wholesale prices of white maize were more than 70 percent higher than a year earlier, due to tight supplies and high production costs.\n\nThe most recent national survey in El Salvador (Dry corridor) found that 2.1 percent of children were acutely malnourished and 14 percent stunted (MICS 2014). However, a UNICEF evaluation conducted in 2017 found that 17 percent of children in rural drought-affected households suffered from acute malnutrition.\n\nIn Honduras (Dry corridor) the acute malnutrition of children did not suffer significantly as a result of the drought: only 1.3 percent of children in the regions affected by the 2018 drought were acutely malnourished according to monitoring by UNICEF and WFP. The impact of the drought on the availability of water also seemed to be limited: 80 percent of families said they had enough water for consumption, sanitation and hygiene at the time of being interviewed, although half of them said they had less water compared to the same period in the previous year. According to the available data of ENDESA (2011-2012), no department presented acute malnutrition above five percent.\n\nIn Guatemala (Dry Corridor), although only 0.7 percent of the population under five was affected by acute malnutrition in 2014/15, a field study conducted by WFP and UNICEF among poor rural families in 2017 found that 3.4 percent of children aged 12-23 months were suffering from acute malnutrition, three times higher than the number registered in 2014. Chronic malnutrition continued to be a serious problem, affecting 46.7 percent of the population under five years of age.90 Only 15 percent of children aged 6-24 months received Vitamin A supplementation.91 While 85 percent of the population used water from improved sources, only 64 percent of the population had access to basic sanitation services.92\n\nENSMI 2014/2015. 90\n\nUNICEF Global Database 2018. 92 UNICEF/WHO Joint Monitoring Programme. 91\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 958, N o\n\n01 83M IDPs in the provinces of Kasai, Central Kasai, Eastern Kasai, Lomami, Sankuru, South Kivu and Tanganyika. 534 828 refugees and asylum seekers mainly from Rwanda, the Central African Republic, South Sudan and Burundi.\n\n4.5M returnees in the provinces of Kasai, Central Kasai, Eastern Kasai, Lomami, Sankuru, South Kivu and Tanganyika.\n\nThe number of food-insecure people in need of urgent action increased mainly as a result of an intensification of the protracted conflict, exacerbated by crop pests, floods and diseases, against a backdrop of widespread poverty.\n\n13.1M IPC PHASE 3 OR ABOVE 84.9M\n\n56% RURAL\n\n44% URBAN\n\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO • Conflict and intercommunal violence prompted massive displacement.\n\n• Conflict disrupted agriculture, trade, access to food, safe water and basic services.\n\n• Plant and animal diseases, floods, dry spells and landslides constrained food production.

From the second half of September 2018, maize prices rose significantly as a result of reduced harvests, low market supplies and the export restriction on maize from Zambia. In Haut-Katanga in the Lubumbashi market, maize prices increased by about 56 percent compared to the previous month.\n\nWFP Bulletin trimestriel d'information sur la Sécurité Alimentaire no. 2, June-August 2018 97\n\nThe second largest country in Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is ranked seventh out of 178 countries on the 2017 Fragile States Index, placing it in the highest category of risk and reflecting widespread conflict and insecurity.93 Conflicts have prevailed in eastern provinces for the past two decades and recently broke out in other areas. In addition, the Congolese people suffer the effects of extreme poverty, chronic poverty, underdevelopment, and human rights violations. While the country has the agricultural potential to feed 2 billion people,94 its population of 85 million inhabitants still faces one of the most serious food and nutrition crisis in the world. Presidential elections - originally planned for December 2016 - were subject to continuous delays and finally held on 30 December 2018.\n\nAs of August 2018, some 13.1 million people required urgent action, consisting of 9.8 million people facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and 3.3 million people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4).

Agricultural production in 2017/2018 was well below that of the 2016/2017 campaign, negatively affecting food availability and access. While crops benefited mostly from favourable agro-climatic conditions, localized floods and erratic rainfalls were reported in North-Kivu, South Kivu, Tanganyika and in other localized areas.101\n\nFall armyworm infestations caused maize production losses.102 Conflict in the aforementioned regions as well as dry spells in localized eastern areas also undermined food production.103 Confronted with plant pests and diseases, armed conflicts and lack of quality inputs, farmers significantly reduced planted areas compared to the previous agricultural campaign.104\n\nThe livestock sector was reportedly devastated by conflicts and animal diseases105 (e.g. Peste des Petits Ruminants in North-Kivu106), which reduced the availability of meat and livelihood products as well as purchasing power of livestock-producing households.\n\nBetween February and November 2018 around 2.96 million people were reportedly displaced in the provinces of Kasai, Central Kasai, Eastern Kasai, Lomami, Sankuru, South Kivu and Tanganyika - almost all of them (93 percent) had been displaced by armed attacks and intercommunal conflicts, and more than half (58 percent) had been displaced in 2017. Over the same period, more than 4.5 million people had returned from displacement in these provinces - including over a million returnees in 2018.107\n\nIn August, massive returns of displaced populations were reported in the Kasai region and in the South-Kivu, Tanganyika and Ituri provinces after security improved in these areas - in spite of inter-ethnic conflict in Uvira, South-Kivu's agro-pastoral breadbasket.108 Since early October, an expulsion order issued by the Angolan\n\nFAO GIEWS Country Brief Democratic Republic of the Congo, August, 8, 2018 102 Ministère de l'agriculture, FAO, CAID & WFP Rapport Sécurité alimentaire, August 2018 103 FAO GIEWS Country Brief Democratic Republic of the Congo, February 26, 2018 104 Ministère de l'agriculture, FAO, CAID & WFP Rapport Sécurité alimentaire, August 2018 105 Ibid 106 FEWS NET Key message update, October 2018 107 IOM, Displacement Tracking Matrix The Democratic Republic of 101\n\nCongo - Key findings, February-November 2018 108 FEWS NET.

As of 1 January 2019, there were 608 confirmed cases of Ebola and 368 deaths, according to WHO.111\n\nIn the provinces of Kasai, Kasai Central and Kasai Oriental one in 10 children (at least 770 000) were suffering from acute malnutrition, including 400 000 severely malnourished and at risk of death, according to a May 2018 UNICEF report.112 Displaced children have been denied access to health care, safe drinking water and food in sufficient quantity and quality as displaced families were unable to plant and harvest their crops. The report found that immunization schedules for children were interrupted by the violence and more than 200 health centres were looted, burnt or destroyed. The region faced outbreaks of cholera, yellow fever and measles.\n\nIn the first nine months of the year there were over 19 000 cholera outbreaks nationally, with more than half of all the cases and deaths in Great Kasai. South Kivu and Tanganyika were also badly affected. The outbreaks are related to a lack of access to safe water, lack of medical supplies and a general lack of community interventions.113\n\nInfant and young child feeding practices also underlie the high levels of malnutrition with just 20 percent of children aged 6-23 months meeting minimum dietary diversity requirements, and eight percent a minimum acceptable diet.114 High levels of anaemia among childbearing women and children, inadequate breastfeeding practices and poor access to sanitation and clean drinking water also contribute.\n\nOCHA.

Its reliance on imports (and humanitarian assistance) to meet its food requirements makes it more vulnerable to external market downturns, currency fluctuations and price volatility. Despite rapid and sustained growth over the past 15 years, around 35 percent of the population is below the poverty line, with 20 percent living in extreme poverty.115 Overall, 78 percent of the poor population lives in rural areas.116 Livestock represents the main livelihood for one third of the total population, but it accounts for only three percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).117\n\nAs of April 2018, moderate and severe food insecurity affected 55.5 percent of rural households in the five rural regions of Ali-Sabieh, Arta, Dikhil, Obock and Tadjourah. Of these, three percent were severely food insecure. In addition, almost 40 percent of rural households were marginally food insecure. This marks a 22 percent increase in the number of people in moderate and severe food insecurity since October 2017.118\n\nModerate food insecurity prevailed in almost two in three households of Tadjourah (63 percent) and Dikhil (59 percent) regions, while it affected one in two households in Arta (51 percent) and Ali-Sabieh (39 percent) regions. The regions most affected by severe food insecurity are Ali Sabieh (six percent) and Dikhil (five percent) regions.119\n\nWhile the recourse to negative coping strategies was less pronounced than in 2014, it mainly remained higher than in 2015, 2016 and 2017 as rural households still faced constrained food availability and access and over half of them (51 percent) reported employing negative coping strategies - with 17 percent resorting to emergency strategies such as selling houses or committing illegal acts, 15 percent resorting to crisis strategies such as\n\nWorld Bank 116 WFP Bulletin Djibouti - Système de Suivi et Surveillance de la 115\n\nSécurité Alimentaire (SSSA), May 2018. 117 World Bank 118 WFP Bulletin Djibouti - Système de Suivi et Surveillance de la Sécurité Alimentaire (SSSA), May 2018. 119 Ibid reducing non-food expenses, and 22 percent using stress strategies, such as buying food on credit or using savings. In the region of Dikhil, more than eight households in 10 resorted to negative coping in April 2018.120\n\nIn inland pastoral areas of Dikhil and Tadjourah regions, below-average 2018 March-June \"diraac/sougum\" rains resulted in an incomplete regeneration of rangeland resources and in a reduced availability of animal feed. Subsequently, abundant August-October \"karan/karma\" rains prompted a marked improvement in vegetation conditions, with a positive impact on water and pasture availability. In coastal areas, after very poor OctoberMarch 2017/18 \"heys/dadaa\" rains, Cyclone Sagar struck the country on 19 and 20 May, bringing torrential rains. The precipitations received, about 110 mm, were the equivalent of the average rainfall for an entire year and led to high runoff and low moisture recharge, resulting in limited improvements in vegetation conditions but\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 964 triggering floods that affected about 50 000 people in the capital, Djibouti City, and in the southern Balbala suburb. Subsequently, the first part of the 2018/19 \"heys/dadaa\" rains was characterized by below-average precipitations, and as of late 2018 vegetation conditions were very poor in coastal areas.\n\nRural households in inland areas faced significantly reduced financial access to food as a result of poor rains that curtailed production and sales of livestock products, as well as the governmental ban on coal and firewood sales. Urban households have also faced decreased economic opportunities in the construction industry in recent years.\n\nIn remote rural areas markets were poorly supplied with food product varieties - mainly limited to cereals, sugar and oil - and prices were almost twice as high as in the main regional marketplace, due to high transportation costs and commercial margin. Around 89 percent of moderately and severely food-insecure households relied on markets to access food, with 25 percent of them having to resort to credit to buy it. On average, rural households spent 70 percent of their income on food, and reported at least one shock - mainly lack of rains, lack of food, soaring prices, and drought-related livestock deaths - affecting their income during the three months before the survey. 121\n\nWFP.

With the exception of those who have sufficient financial means to live in small hotels, most live in miserable conditions waiting for the chance to leave for a second country of asylum.\n\nThe prevalence of GAM, measured using mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) among under fives, reached 13 percent in October 2017, up from 7.5 percent in October 2016, but below the October 2015 prevalence of 17 percent.125 Among them 4.5 percent were severely acutely malnourished in 2017. The regions of Obock (24.8 percent) and Dikhil (14 percent) had the highest GAM levels.\n\nThis poor nutritional situation is largely attributable to lack of dietary diversity among poor rural households, as well as inadequate child feeding practices. No child under two has a minimum acceptable diet as a result of limited physical and economic market access.126\n\nWFP, Government of Djibouti, URD Revue Stratégique « Faim zero à Djibouti », June 2018 123 UNHCR East, Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes Region - Refugees and Asylum-seekers by country of asylum, 31 October 2018 124 FAO GIEWS.

Lactating women in poor households, where consumption of animal products is very limited, suffer from insufficient protein intake. In rural areas, poor sanitation, low access to clean drinking water and lack of access to basic healthcare linked to the nomadic lifestyle of the population undermine nutrition. Children's vulnerability to disease is increasing, with inadequate immunization coverage and the continuing influx of refugees intensifying the risk of epidemics.\n\nIn camps the nutritional situation of refugees is worrying. The prevalence of GAM was 17.6 percent in Markazi/ Obock and 11.9 percent in Holl Holl, where new arrivals tend to have even higher levels.

The small, mountainous, landlocked country has very high rates of poverty, inequality and unemployment and the highest rate of HIV infection in the world. The country's economy is closely linked to neighbouring South Africa, on which it depends for about 85 percent of its imports and about 60 percent of exports.130\n\nAccording to the IPC Acute Food Insecurity analysis conducted in November 2018, a peak number of 247 000 people (26 percent of the rural population) were expected to be in IPC Phase 3 or above, and in need of urgent action to save lives, protect livelihoods, reduce food consumption gaps and acute malnutrition. Of these, 79 000 were projected to be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and 168 000 in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Additionally, over 301 000 were in Stressed (IPC Phase 2).\n\nLubombo and Shiselweni showed the highest levels of acute food insecurity with 40 percent of the rural population facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4). In Shiselweni 15 percent and in Lubombo 10 percent of the population faced Emergency conditions.\n\nThis reflects a deterioration towards the end of 2018 compared to the end of the previous year (177 000 people), mainly due to less favourable rainfall conditions in the 2018/2019 agricultural season - but a general improvement compared to the annual peak of 2017 when 350 000 acutely food-insecure people needed urgent assistance, reflecting the prolonged impact of the 2015-2016 El Niño related drought.\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 968\n\nSource: Eswatini IPC Technical Working Group November 2018\n\nMap 15 Eswatini, IPC Acute food insecurity situation, December 2018-March 2019\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 69\n\nFACTORS DRIVING ACUTE\n\nFOOD INSECURITY\n\nProduction shortfalls in eastern Lubombo and southern Shiselweni regions, due mostly to a mid-season dry period, were the main factors underpinning food insecurity in 2018. About nine percent of households nationally could not harvest, mainly due to crop failure and lack of access to arable land rising to 49 percent in Lubombo. Shiselweni had the highest proportion of households whose food reserves would last less than two months.131\n\nIn addition, infestations of the fall armyworm caused yield losses in localized parts, further reducing harvests in affected areas.\n\nAlthough high rates of food insecurity were estimated in southern and eastern regions, nationally an estimated increase in the cereal output to an above-average level improved food availability and resulted in an overall lower number of food-insecure people compared to 2017. Rangelands and livestock conditions were also favourable in most parts of the country throughout 2018, owing to the generally beneficial seasonal rains.\n\nDecreasing prices of maize, the main food staple, reflecting reduced prices in South Africa - the country's main source of imported grains - and good national supplies, also improved food access. In addition, imports of cereals were down in the 2018/19 marketing year, reflecting the larger domestic harvest. Any further improvement in food security in 2018 was curbed by the continuing high rates of poverty and unemployment, as well as sluggish economic growth. An estimated 38 percent of the population lives in extreme poverty (based on the international poverty line of USD 1.90 a day) and almost one in four working age people were unemployed in 2018 (23 percent).132 High prevalence of HIV continued to adversely affect livelihoods, through the loss of productive skills and incomes, for example, further underpinning food insecurity.\n\nSADC. Kingdom of Eswatini - Annual Vulnerability Assessment and Analysis Report 2018 132 World Bank country overview 131\n\nIn 2018 the GAM rate for children under five was 2.4 percent. The SAM rate was 0.8 percent. Chronic malnutrition continued to be of concern, with 21 percent of children under five years of age stunted.133\n\nA range of factors can be associated with malnutrition in Eswatini. They include poor dietary diversity and poor intake of nutrient-rich foods, high HIV prevalence (nearly 27 percent of the adult population134) and poor access to sanitation (nearly 30 percent of households do not have access to improved sanitation facilities).135\n\nThe consumption of nutrient-rich foods has been falling despite improvements in overall food consumption. The percentage of households consuming no vitamin A-rich foods increased from 17 percent in 2017 to 23 percent in 2018, no iron-rich foods from 33 percent to 49 percent and no protein-rich foods from seven percent to 27 percent. Around 38 percent of children aged 6-23 months have a minimum acceptable diet.136\n\nSADC. Kingdom of Eswatini. Annual Vulnerability Assessment and Analysis Report 2018 134 UN AIDS 2017 135 SADC.

In March, around 7.9 million were in need of food-related humanitarian assistance - including 3.2 million in Oromia, 1.8 million in Somali region and 977 000 people in Amhara, according to the Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP) for 2018, released in March.139 In October, the estimate was revised up in the Mid-Year Review to 8 million (7 953 893) - with the largest increase observed in Tigray (15 percent).140\n\nThese 2018 figures represent a decline in the population in need of food assistance in comparison to 2017, when it was estimated that 8.5 million people were in need of assistance, according to the Mid-Year Review document.141\n\nAs of June, the areas most affected by the 2016 and 2017 drought were classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), such as Dollo and large parts of the south-eastern Somali region,142 and such food security outcomes persisted in most of the south-eastern pastoral areas until December 2018.143 In August, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Stressed (IPC Phase 2!) food insecurity levels were reported in areas bordering Oromia and Somali region, and Oromia and SNNPR.144 From October to December, northern pastoral FAO Crop Prospects and Food Situation no.4, December 2018. 138 WFP Food and Nutrition Assistance to IDPs in East and West 137\n\nHararghe zones, September 2018; FEWS NET Ethiopia Food Security Outlook, October 2018\n\nJoint Government and Humanitarian Partners Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan, March 2018 140 Joint Government and Humanitarian Partners Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan Mid-Year Review, October 2018 141 Joint Government and Humanitarian Partners Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan Mid-Year Review, July 2017 142 FEWS NET Ethiopia Food Security Outlook, June 2018 143 FEWS NET Food Security Outlook Update, December 2018 144 FEWS NET Food Security Outlook Update, August 2018 139\n\nFP /P\n\nET ER\n\nS M\n\nER D\n\nO N\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 972\n\nHigh food prices hindered the most vulnerable households' access to food. The devaluation of the Birr against the USD in October 2017 pushed up prices of imported goods, such as wheat grain.163 As of March, general year-on-year inflation was about 15 percent, while food inflation was near 20 percent. The nominal wholesale price of maize reached alarming levels, increasing by up to 56 percent between March 2017 and 2018, with the highest increases in surplus-producing areas (i.e. Dejen, Bahirdar, Nazareth). On average, maize prices were 37 percent above the five-year average in monitored markets.164 At the end of 2018, rising transportation costs also contributed to price increases in anticipation of the Meher harvest.\n\nAccording to the 2018 belg harvest assessment, 3.5 million children under five and around 1 million pregnant and lactating women were acutely malnourished in September, up from 3.8 million in January.165,166 The number of acutely malnourished children increased from 2.1 million in the early 2018 to 2.4 million by September. Some 370 000 of them (up from 350 000 in January) were expected to be severely malnourished, with Oromia (139 000), Somali (99 000), SNNP (54 000) and Amhara (42 000) the worst-affected regions.\n\nIn 2016 around 10 percent of children under five years were acutely malnourished,167 with little change over the last decade. GAM levels were above emergency thresholds (>15 percent) in Somali and Afar states, which have benefitted less from development investment and are frequently affected by drought-induced humanitarian crises.168\n\nAlthough Ethiopia has seen a steady reduction in stunting among children under five from 58 percent in 2000 to 38 percent in 2016, the level remains very high.\n\nThe effect of prolonged drought, particularly in Somali region, water scarcity in pastoral areas, and the increased numbers of IDPs unable to access basic sanitation drive this poor nutrition situation. In addition, political instability in August disrupted all basic services including health and nutrition, during a period when high rates of acute malnutrition prevail.\n\nWFP Ethiopia Monthly Market Watch Report, June 2018. 164 WFP Ethiopia Monthly Market Watch Report, March 2018 165 Humanitarian Disaster and Resilience Plan mid-year Review 2018 166 Ethiopia Humanitarian Disaster and Resilience Plan 2018 167 2016 Demographic Health Survey (DHS) 168 Ibid 163 conception rates.151 Parts of southern Somali and Oromia faced below-average pasture regeneration as the Deyr/ Hageya rainy season (October-December) was delayed and dry spells were reported in most southern pastoral areas - except in and around Shabelle and Nogob.152\n\nDespite an increase in cereal prices, pastoralist terms-oftrade were generally stable, thanks to improved livestock body conditions and high demand for holiday festivities. In certain areas, however, households had few livestock to sell as a result of the reduced herd size from the 2016 and 2017 droughts.153\n\nThe 2018 national crop production of the main agricultural season (Meher) was average.154 In spite of favourable prospects in the key producing areas of the western highlands - western Oromia, Amhara and Benishangul Gumuz regions - erratic rainfall in central and eastern areas as well as unseasonal rains at harvest time caused local crop production shortfalls.155,156 In SNNPR close to 19 000 hectares of maize crops were infested with fall armyworm during the 2018 Belg season,157 while in East and West Hararghe planted areas were 60 percent below average as a result of conflict.158\n\nIntercommunal conflicts between Somali and Oromia, and between SNNPR and Oromia triggered massive population displacement across the country. As of December, 2.3 million people were internally displaced, of whom 1.8 million were displaced by conflict and more than 498 000 by climate shocks.159 Almost the totality of the IDP population (93 percent) was located in Oromia and Somali regions.160\n\nIn addition, as of 31 August, Ethiopia was hosting nearly 906 000 registered refugees and asylum seekers - mostly from South Sudan, Somalia, Eritrea and the Sudan.161 The presence of large displaced populations increased competition with host communities over land resources, food and labour opportunities.162\n\nFEWS NET Ethiopia Food Security Outlook Update, August 2018 152 FEWS NET Ethiopia Key Message Update, November 2018 153 FEWS NET Ethiopia Food Security Outlook, October 201 154 FEWS NET Ethiopia Food Security Outlook Update, December 2018. 155 FAO GIEWS Country Brief 156 FEWS NET Ethiopia Key Message Update, July 2018 157 FEWS NET Ethiopia Food Security Outlook, June 2018 158 FEWS NET Ethiopia Food Security Outlook Update, August 2018 159 IOM, Dec 2018 160 IOM Ethiopia DTM Round 13, October 2018 161 UNHCR Ethiopia Factsheet, December 2018 162 FEWS NET Ethiopia Food Security Outlook, October 2018 151\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 73\n\nMap 16 Ethiopia IPC Acute Food Insecurity Phase Classification, June-September 2018\n\nThe lack of health services capable of managing periodic spikes in acute malnutrition caseloads further exacerbate the risk of opportunistic disease outbreak, notably acute watery diarrhoea.

In 2010 a devastating earthquake hit Haiti; in 2016 during the third consecutive year of El Niño-related drought Hurricane Matthew shattered western Haiti; in 2017 Hurricanes Irma and Maria caused significant flooding in the north and in 2018 the El Niño-induced drought affected the production of major crops and resulted in a significant decline in households' income.\n\nFrom October 2018 to February 2019, 2.3 million people, representing 32 percent of the population analysed, were in need of urgent food and livelihood support (IPC Phase 3 or above). Of these around 1.9 million (27 percent) were classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and 386 000 (six percent of the analysed population) were classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4).\n\nThis is the same as the peak (February-May) lean season figure for 2017. It marks a significant deterioration compared to early 2018 when 1.3 million Haitians (18 percent of the population analysed) were estimated to be in IPC Phase 3 or above. In October 2017-February 2018 over 3 million were classified in Stressed, falling to 2.4 million people in October 2018-February 2019 as people slipped into Crisis or worse.\n\nExcept for three districts located in the coastal area of the Southern department, lower North West and rice producing area of Artibonite, which were classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2), all districts (18 out of 21) were classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). In terms of magnitude, the North West department had the highest percentage of food insecure (45 percent) in IPC Phase 3 or above while the West department had the highest number of people (more than 500 000) in Crisis or Emergency.\n\n3.09 2.42\n\n1.19 1.87\n\n0.13 0.39\n\nOct 2017- Feb 2018 Oct 2018- Feb 2019\n\nStressed 3 Crisis 4 Emergency 5 Catastrophe 2\n\nSource: Haiti IPC Technical Working Group\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 976\n\nClimate shocks and natural disasters\n\nOver two-thirds of Haitians depend on agriculture as their main source of food and income, therefore when a disaster strikes, it can wipe out a household's means to make a living.173\n\nThe worsening food security situation is driven by the prolonged effects of several years of recurrent natural shocks, reduced agricultural production of major cereals and food price volatility which have particularly affected very poor and poor households.174 Recurrent droughts and back-to-back emergencies make it difficult for many Haitians to rebound, weakening their resilience against future shocks.\n\nAfter a good start to the rainy season in April and May 2018, when main season beans, maize and other crops were sown, a period of drought caused by the El Niño phenomenon followed in June, which is a critical time for beans and maize crops. The drought affected a large part of the country, depressing production of the main cereal crops (except rice). Poor rainfall distribution in the spring and summer in other areas also affected crop production.\n\nFAO country overview 174 IPC country analysis 173\n\nHaiti is the poorest country of the Americas with 59 percent living below the national poverty line and 24 percent below the extreme poverty line,175 making Haitians extremely vulnerable to repeated disasters as well as to global food price spikes as it does not produce enough food to meet its needs. In October 2018 commodity prices had risen by nine percent from 2017 and general inflation stood at 14.1 percent undermining purchasing power and food access, especially for the poorest households.176 At the end of 2018 markets were well supplied but prices of imported rice, maize meal and vegetable oil were well above the five-year average in monitored markets, while prices of black beans declined slightly.177 The weakened value of the Haitian gourde against the US dollar178 also heightened the price of imported rice and maize.\n\nSocio-political unrest - with protests against political corruption and economic malaise - sometimes disrupted distribution and caused rises in the prices of essential goods.179\n\nDespite the resumption of agricultural activities, demand for agricultural labour was still low in October following World Bank country overview 176 IPC country analysis 177 FEWS NET.

Smallholder farmers generally lack access to credit, appropriate technology and key production factors, especially irrigation water.182 Post-harvest losses are considerable, often the result of a lack of storage and processing facilities and road infrastructure is poor.\n\nThe most recent national health survey (DHS 2016-2017) showed high rates of chronic malnutrition (according to WHO thresholds), with one in five children under five years of age (22 percent) affected by stunting. The survey showed that four percent of children under five years suffered from GAM, and one percent from SAM.\n\nIn 2018, 228 800 people were estimated to be in need of nutrition humanitarian assistance in the departments of FEWS NET.

This included 75 900 children under five years affected by GAM, 25 200 of them with SAM.183\n\nInadequate feeding practices, the persistent risk of food insecurity, exposure to natural disasters, high incidence of infectious diseases (especially acute watery diarrhea and cholera) and inadequate access to services continue to make Haiti's population vulnerable to malnutrition. Nearly half of the population (45 percent) is without access to improved water, 31 percent defecate in the open and 75 percent are without access to a handwashing facility with soap.184 Infant and child feeding practices are poor. Only two in five infants under six months are exclusively breastfed, and just one in four 6-23 month-olds are fed according to minimum dietary diversity criteria.185\n\nThe incidence rate of cholera in the first seven months of the year was the lowest since the beginning of the outbreak in 2011. Around 2 900 cases were reported including 35 deaths - mainly in the departments of Artibonite, Centre and Ouest - with a spike in April and May 2018 because of localized outbreaks following heavy rains.186\n\nRevised Humanitarian Response Plan 2017-2018 (JanuaryDecember 2018). 184 Ibid 185 EMMUS-VI 2016-2017. 186 OCHA.

June 2018 193\n\nIraq has been a battleground for competing global forces since 2003, enjoying only brief periods of respite from high levels of violence. This instability has hindered efforts to rebuild an economy shattered by decades of conflict and sanctions, even though Iraq has the world's second-largest reserves of crude oil. In late 2017, three years after the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) started to seize control of major areas of Iraqi territory - leading to it controlling around one-third of the country in 2015 - the country's Prime Minister officially announced government forces had regained control.187 Four years of active fighting across large swathes of the country led to large-scale, multidirectional, and protracted displacement, and areas that experienced active conflict remain heavily damaged or destroyed.188\n\nOut of the 6.7 million people in Iraq who are in need of humanitarian assistance, about 2.5 million are food insecure with most of those in need of food and livelihoods assistance concentrated in Diyala, Ninewa, Dahuk, Anbar and Erbil governorates.189\n\nMeeting food security needs is particularly challenging for three population groups: displaced households (62 percent live among host communities and 30 percent live in camps), those non-displaced but living in areas that were recently retaken or are still experiencing sporadic conflict, and those returning home.\n\nThe rates of food insecurity vary little between these groups with IDPs slightly more likely to face food gaps: around 10 percent (380 000) of returnees and nondisplaced people, 11 percent of in-camp IDPs and 12 percent of out-of-camp IDPs are in need of food and livelihood assistance.190\n\nReturnees face significant food consumption gaps, spend a high share of their expenditure on food and routinely resort to negative coping strategies.191 The three governorates with the highest number of food-insecure returnee populations are Ninewa (162 000), Salah al-Din (76 000) and Anbar (63 000).\n\nAn estimated seven percent of the approximately 253 000 Syrian refugees in Iraq192 are food insecure, with UNSC.

Each employed adult in an IDP household must support more than six other household members.206 Over the past few years, more than 4.2 million IDPs have returned to their areas of origin.207 Significant barriers still exist to re-building their lives and livelihoods, including security concerns, lack of job opportunities and destroyed or damaged housing.\n\nJust over half of IDP households in and out of camps had accessed Iraq's Public Distribution System (PDS), an important safety net that provides subsidized food items, versus 87 percent of returnee and non-displaced households.208 While IDP households registered in formal camps had regular access to humanitarian food distributions, a significant portion of IDPs living out of camps had lower access to both forms of food assistance.209\n\nReturnees and vulnerable households in communities hosting displaced people faced limited livelihood opportunities in addition to security concerns, lack of social cohesion, damaged housing and lack of services. The most urgent needs remained in areas affected by past hostilities where infrastructure was destroyed and services disrupted. For seven governorates affected by conflict, unemployment rates increased from 13 percent to 18 percent between 2014 and 2017.210\n\nIDPs cited damage and destruction to housing, lack of job opportunities and lack of safety in their locations of origin as key main obstacles to returning to their homes.211 In addition they feared discrimination, trauma associated with returning, contamination with explosive hazards and lack of security forces.212\n\nIOM Iraq Mission Displacement Tracking Matrix, December 2018 204 OCHA.

Analysis of the nutrition situation at governorate level indicated high rates of severe acute malnutrition in Babylon, Thi Oar and Qadisiya, and among IDPs in Diyala, Salah al-Deen and Najaf governorates. The prevalence of stunting was 16.6 percent among resident children and 19.2 percent among IDP children. The highest severe stunting rates for both resident and IDP children were recorded in the Baghdad region.\n\nThe recently conducted analysis at governate level (MICS 2018)214 indicated high rates of moderate and severe acute malnutrition in Basra, Kirkuk, Anbar, Kerbala, Najaf, Qadisiya, and Sulaimanya. The highest severe stunting rates were recorded in Baghdad, Thiqar and Munthana.\n\nRates of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for the recommended six months are extremely low at 19.6 percent, and only 42.8 percent of women initiate breastfeeding within the first hour of a child's life. Micronutrient deficiencies and sub-optimal infant and child feeding practices remain a concern and contribute to malnutrition. More than one in five children aged 12-59 months had anaemia, iron deficiency, or iron deficiency anaemia.215\n\nWFP.

By August this number had fallen to 700 000.\n\nIn mid-2018, food security was buoyed by exceptionally abundant March-May 2018 \"long rains\" (one of the wettest seasons in about 70 years), markedly improving crop and livestock production. In key growing areas of the Rift Valley and Western provinces, the major longrains harvest, accounting for about 75 percent of the national yearly cereal production, was estimated at 10-15 percent above-average despite localized crop losses due to floods.220 By contrast, the output of beans, more vulnerable to excess moisture, was below-average. In pastoral areas, abundant pasture and water availability drove atypically good livestock body conditions, resulting in above average milk production and livestock prices.\n\nHowever, at the peak of the rains in April, flooding caused widespread damage. By May, approximately 150 people had died and around 310 000 were displaced across 40 counties.221 Cropland and irrigation infrastructure, including pumps and pipes, were extensively damaged. Standing crops in Turkana, Tana River, Embu, Kitui, Makueni, Narok, Taita Taveta, and FAO 221 https://reliefweb.int/disaster/ff-2018-000030-ken 220\n\nThe World Bank reclassified Kenya's economy as lowermiddle income in 2014, but poverty, food insecurity, under-nutrition and income inequality remain high. Nearly half of Kenyans live below the poverty line.216 The most severe conditions exist in the arid and semi-arid drought-prone north, which accounts for 80 percent of the country's land-mass and is often disrupted by local conflicts. After three consecutive poor rainy seasons, households in the pastoral and agro-pastoralist northeast and north-west counties had not fully recovered or replenished their productive assets by early 2018. The\n\n2016-2017 drought had caused livestock emaciation and animal deaths, and led to severe shortages of livestock products (mainly milk).\n\nThe overall number of acutely food-insecure people was estimated at 2.35 million in January 2018, 30 percent down from the estimate of 3.4 million in October 2017, but still seven percent higher than the caseload of 2.2 million estimated in January 2017.217 Despite the significant improvements recorded in most livelihood zones, in January 2018, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) food insecurity levels still persisted in several pastoral and agro-pastoral areas, including parts of Turkana, Marsabit, Mandera, Wajir, Tana River, Kajado, Isiolo and Garissa counties.\n\nIn August 2018, 700 000 people in arid and semi-arid (ASAL) counties were facing acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 and higher) and required urgent humanitarian assistance, a significantly lower figure than the 2.55 million identified in February 2018 after the last short rains assessment.218\n\nFEWS NET predicted a deterioration in food security in the latter quarter of the year with the number of poor households in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) expected to increase in Turkana, Samburu, Wajir and Garissa counties.219 While most households in marginal agricultural areas were able to meet their minimum food needs (IPC Phase 1), consuming two to three meals per day, most households in pastoral areas were Stressed (IPC Phase 2), reportedly consuming one to two meals per day.\n\nThe number of people in need of urgent humanitarian food and livelihood assistance peaked in February when 2.6 million people in the conflict-affected arid and semi-\n\nWFP country brief November 2018. 217 FAO GIEWS.

Health facilities, schools, markets and roads were destroyed, affecting access to health and education, the supply of food commodities and medical provisions.222\n\nThe short rains harvest, which accounts for just 25 percent of the yearly aggregate cereal production but is critical in south-eastern and coastal marginal agricultural areas, where it provides up to 60 percent of the total annual cereal output, was expected to be 70 percent below-average, as the October-December rains were characterized by an erratic distribution and poor precipitation amounts.\n\nGovt. Kenya, 31 Aug 2018. 222\n\nThe short rains are also vital for replenishment of rangeland resources in northern and eastern pastoral livelihood zones, where poor rainfall distribution and long dry spells undermined water and forage resources. As a result, an increased reliance on consumption-based coping strategies was reported in pastoral north-eastern Garissa and Wajir counties and in agro-pastoral eastern and coastal Makueni, Tharaka Nithi, Kilifiand Taita Taveta counties in November.223\n\nFall armyworm infestations in the mixed farming and agro-pastoral livelihood zones caused substantial destruction to the maize crop and subsequent reduction in maize production. Locust invasions, mainly in Marsabit and Turkana, invaded both pasture and browse.\n\nFEWS NET. Kenya Food Security Outlook.

However, following the poor performance of the short rains, large numbers of camels from Isiolo county migrated into Tharaka Nithi county in October, increasing the potential for conflict. Conflict incidents over forage were reported in Kitui county, while in Isiolo, border disputes and communal tensions were reported along the Isiolo-Garissa border resulting in population displacement.224 Terror-related incidences were reported in Lamu, Isiolo, Mandera and Moyale in Marsabit.\n\nFEWS NET Kenya Food Security Outlook, December 2018 to May 2019. 224\n\nIn November, maize prices across key urban and rural reference markets ranged from near-average to 36 percent below the five-year average. The exception was in Garissa market, where maize prices were seven percent above the five-year average.225 The proportion of Kenyans living on less than the international poverty line226 declined from around 47 percent in 2005/06 to 36 percent in 2015/16. In the remote, sparsely populated north-eastern parts of the country (Turkana, Mandera, and Wajir), agro-climatic shocks affect those who depend on livestock and low-productivity agricultural activities. Here poverty rates are above 80 percent.227\n\nIbid. 226 US$1.90 per day in 2011 227 World Bank 225\n\nMap 22 Kenya IPC Acute Food Insecurity Phase Classification, June-September 2018\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 986\n\nKenya hosts over 470 000 refugees and asylum seekers, with around 257 000 from Somalia followed by 115 000 from South Sudan, 41 000 from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 28 000 from Ethiopia.228 About 44 percent of them reside in the Dadaab refugee camp in north-eastern Garissa county and 40 percent in Kukuma camp in north-western Turkana. Access to basic necessities including food, shelter, water and sanitation is often precarious because of the high concentration of people.

Attacks persisted in northeast Nigeria and Far North region of Cameroon,236 as well as in Chad near the border with Nigeria, which limited humanitarian access.237 In the Niger's Diffa region, the violence disrupted aid operations in some locations.238 Armed groups stepped up raids across Lake Chad Basin conflict-affected areas in 2018. Tens of thousands of people were displaced as a result of poor living conditions, lack of access to humanitarian assistance, military operations and fear of attacks on villages, towns and camps for displaced people.\n\nDuring the June-August lean season, around 3.4 million people faced Crisis (CH Phase 3) and Emergency (CH Phase 4) food security outcomes in the four sub-national areas of the Lake Chad Basin. This represents a significant decrease compared to the same period in 2017 when 5.5 million people were in Crisis (CH Phase 3) or above in three sub-national areas - north-east Nigeria, the Lac region of Chad and Diffa region of the Niger. In addition, 1.5 million people (34 percent of households) were considered moderately or severely food-insecure in Cameroon's Far-North as of December 2017.239 In 2018, no one was classified in Famine (CH Phase 5) throughout the year.\n\nMost of these people in need of urgent food, nutrition and livelihood assistance were in the three states of northeast Nigeria, where three million people were facing Crisis (CH Phase 3) or Emergency (CH Phase 4) in June-August 2018. The situation remained worst in the state of Borno, which accounted for 44 percent of Lake Chad Basin's population in Crisis (CH Phase 3) and over 80 percent of the population in Emergency (CH Phase 4).\n\nIn both years the situation improved following the harvest and was better in 2018 than 2017. From October- December the number of people in Crisis (CH Phase 3) and above in northeast Nigeria, Chad's Lac region and the Niger's Diffa region decreased considerably from 2.7 million - including 1 800 people in Famine (CH Phase 5) - in 2017 to 1.8 million in 2018.\n\nOCHA.

SAM ranged between 0.3-2.5 percent, with the highest levels in Central Borno and North Yobe. In Borno there was a significant increase in the prevalence of acute malnutrition since the previous surveillance round (November-December 2017), consistent with seasonal variation but also suggestive of a worsening nutrition situation. The prevalence was not significantly different in Adamawa and Yobe.\n\nChronic malnutrition or stunting is estimated to be serious in Adamawa (33 percent) and Borno (37 percent) and critical in Yobe (52 percent), according to the 2015 National Nutrition and Health Survey.\n\nIn Cameroon's Far North GAM rates were 9.7 percent and SAM rates 1.4 percent.240 Stunting is a major public health issue with levels reaching 41 percent.241\n\nThe acute malnutrition estimates for the Lac region in Chad have fallen from 18.1 percent in 2017 to 10.5 percent and, unlike the previous years, were better than the national rates.\n\nIn the Diffa region of the Niger nutrition improved very slightly with GAM rates dropping from 13.9 percent in 2017 to 12.6 percent and SAM rates from 2.5 percent to\n\nUnited Nations Children's Fund and Government of Cameroon Ministry of Public Health, Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) survey, 2018 241 SMART survey 2017 240\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 990\n\n2.4 percent at the end of 2018.242 In Mainé Soroa, where children's security is reportedly poor, the GAM rate was 20.7 percent while in N'Gourti it was 16.6 percent.243 Around 15 600 children suffering from acute malnutrition were in need of nutritional support in 2018.244\n\nBesides high levels of food insecurity, the main drivers of malnutrition across the LCB conflict zone included ill-equipped health centres being overwhelmed by casualties of the regional conflict.

These practices are often driven by strong social norms. In north-east Nigeria, for instance, just 16 percent of children aged 6-23 months receive a minimum acceptable diet and 21 percent of children are exclusively breastfed for the recommended six months.246 In Chad it is even lower: 13 percent of 6-23 month-olds have a minimum acceptable diet and 18 percent of infants are exclusively breastfed.247 High rates of psychological trauma and family upheavals due to conflict are also identified as aggravating factors for children's malnutrition in Chad.248\n\nNIGERIA (16 STATES AND FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY 249)\n\nDuring the lean season in June-August, 5.3 million people were classified in Crisis (CH Phase 3) and Emergency (CH Phase 4) in the 16 states of north Nigeria and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), up from 3.7 million from March-May.250 Between October and December, the number fell by 53 percent to 2.5 million in need of urgent assistance for food, nutrition and livelihoods.

In the north-east, almost four in five households had to resort to negative coping strategies during the peak of the lean season in August with displaced households and those headed by women the worst affected.252 In addition, some 5 million people were classified in Stressed (CH Phase 2) in the conflict-affected states.\n\nWFP mVAM bulletin n.10 August 2018. 252\n\n4.75 4.99 4.17 4.57 5.03 4.54\n\n3.24 3.72\n\n2.11 2.13\n\n2.75\n\n1.58\n\n1.38\n\n1.48\n\n0.46 0.20\n\n0.23\n\n0.13\n\n0.04\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\n8.0\n\n10.0\n\n12.0\n\nMar-May 2017 Jun-Aug 2017 Oct-Dec 2017 Mar-May 2018 Jun-Aug 2018 Oct-Dec 2018\n\nStressed 3 Crisis 4 Emergency 5 Famine 2\n\nSource: Cadre Harmonisé\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 992\n\nConflict\n\nIntensified attacks on military checkpoints, worship centres and civilians increased displacement: in October 2018, Nigeria hosted two million IDPs, with the vast majority (1.8 million) of them located in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, a 16 percent increase compared to early 2018. There were also 1.6 million returnees.253\n\nMilitary operations and checkpoints disrupted agricultural production as well as markets and other livelihood activities. While four households in five had access to farmland in Yobe and two in three in Adamawa, almost half of them were not able to cultivate. In Borno two households in three had no access to farmland.254 In Adamawa, floods and conflicts between pastoralists and farmers also weakened household food security.255\n\nFood availability reportedly improved in late 2018 in the north-east as a result of better security conditions IOM DTM round 25-Oct; IOM DTM round 21 - Feb 254 WFP EFSOM, August 2018 255 WFP mVAM bulletin n.10 August 2018 253 and access to land, favourable agro-climatic conditions, gradual recovery of markets, and restoration of livelihoods following continuous provision of assistance. However, the 2018 harvest prospects in the three states were below-average mainly because of the ongoing impact of insecurity in Adamawa and Borno.256,257\n\nLivestock production was hindered by limited access to pasture in north-eastern conflict-affected areas and intercommunal conflicts in central states - Kaduna, Benue, Taraba, and Adamawa - as well as cattle rustling in the north-west.258\n\nIn April, prices in north-eastern markets were higher than in the rest of the country, particularly in parts of Borno,259 because of persisting conflict, interrupted trade, poor road infrastructure, unavailability of trucks and high transportation costs.260 In August maize prices were 50\n\nFEWS NET Food Security Outlook, October 2018 257 CHAnalysis, November 2018; FEWS NET Key message updat 258 FAO GIEWS Country Brief Nigeria, August 2018; FEWS NET Food 256\n\nSecurity Outlook, October 2018 259 FAO GIEWS Country Brief Nigeria, August 2018. 260 FEWS NET & WFP Nigeria Market Monitoring Bulletin, November 13, 2018.\n\nMap 26 Nigeria (16 states and FCT), CH Acute Food Insecurity Situation, June-August 2018\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 93 percent above their two-year average in Borno261 and remained high in November as a result of high demand and low supply following reduced agricultural output.262\n\nCurrency depreciation undermined households' purchasing power - particularly that of livestock owners and cash-crop exporters who rely on cross-border trade.263\n\nAt the national level, the 2017 cereal output was well-above the five-year average despite substantial outbreaks of pests, such as fall armyworm, and floods.264 The 2018 main harvest was also forecast to be favourable across Nigeria except in areas affected by the insurgency and floods.265 In August, 25 states were reportedly affected by major flooding that led to population displacement, damage to houses, infrastructures, livestock and farmland.266 Among the 17 northern states, national disasters were declared in the Niger, Adamawa, Kebbi, and Taraba by October.267\n\nDuring the June-August lean season, almost one million people were classified in Crisis (CH Phase 3) and Emergency (CH Phase 4) across Chad. This corresponds to a 57 percent increase compared to March-May 2018268 and to a 10 percent increase compared to the same period last year.269 By October-December 2018 the number in need had decreased dramatically to around 190 000 people.270\n\nBetween June and August, 19 departments were classified in Crisis (CH Phase 3) and 19 in Stressed (CH Phase 2).

In addition, around 169 000 were classified in Stressed (CH Phase 2).

Transhumance from Sahelian regions to Sudanian areas occurred earlier than normal, triggering intercommunal conflicts between farmers and herders.273\n\nDuring the 2018/2019 campaign, average to aboveaverage rainfall led to favourable cereal production prospects,274 except in the Sudanian areas where cereal production decreased by 4.5 percent compared to 2017 because of dry spells.275\n\nDecreasing incomes, low livestock prices, scant demand for local labour, lack of monetary transfers, and poor agricultural production as a result of the difficult climatic conditions during the 2017/2018 campaign squeezed households' purchasing power. While cereal prices fell below the five-year average in October, terms of trade did not improve for pastoralists, as livestock prices remained low276 because suspended exports to Nigeria and reduced flows to the Sudan and Libya meant there was an excess of supply, which depressed prices.277\n\nPopulation displacement, which mainly stemmed from conflict and insecurity in neighbouring countries, increased pressure on host communities' already stressed economic and natural resources. Approximately 662 000 people were displaced in the country by the end of December, including around 455 000 refugees and asylum seekers, mostly from the Sudan, the Central African Republic and Nigeria.278 In September around 2 700 Nigerian and Cameroonian transhumant herder households affected by the Boko Haram conflict arrived in the regions of Hadjer-Lamis and Chari-Baguirmi, raising the risks of disease outbreaks and exhausted natural resources.279\n\nCH analysis, March 2018. 274 FEWS NET Chad Food Security Outlook Update, September 2018. 275 CH analysis, November 2018. 276 Ibid 277 CH analysis, March 2018. 278 UNHCR Chiffres des Personnes relevant de la compétence du HCR 273 au Tchad - Résumé, December 31, 2018. 279 SISAAP & Food Security Cluster Rapport de mission conjointe (Hadjet Lamis et Chari Baguirmi), September 2018.\n\nMap 27 Chad, CH Acute Food Insecurity Situation, June-August 2018\n\nNational level\n\nStructural factors that affect food security in Sahelian regions even in normal years include degraded land and soil, low agricultural production, poverty and limited access to safe drinking water and sanitation.271 During the 2017/2018 campaign aggregate cereal production was 2.1 percent below the five-year average and five percent below year-earlier levels as localized dry spells affected crop production in Kanem, Lac, Wadi Fira, Batha Hadjer Lamis and Bahr El Ghazal.272\n\nWFP Republic of Chad: EFSA in Sahelian Departments affected by rainfall anomalies, June 2018. 272 FAO GIEWS Country Brief Chad, June 15, 2018. 271\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 95\n\nLac region\n\nIn 2018, localized dry spells in tandem with civil conflict, which disrupted maize and sorghum production, trade and market supplies, drove food insecurity.280\n\nAs of April, the pastoral situation in Lac was characterized by a complete exhaustion of inland pastures, while pastures on islands could not be exploited because of the presence of Boko Haram.281 For security reasons the government restricted other sectors of food production, such as fishing.282\n\nPopulation displacements were also considerable in the Lac region: 126 000 people were internally displaced in addition to around 39 000 returnees, as of December.283 As a result of disrupted livelihoods, households resorted to negative coping strategies such as reducing non-food expenses earlier in 2018 than usual.284 At the peak of the lean season, in August, food prices were lower than the five-year average because of low demand.285\n\nNATIONAL NUTRITION OVERVIEW Nationally 13.5 percent of children were acutely malnourished, reaching beyond the 15 percent Emergency threshold in 12 out of 23 provinces and peaking at 25 percent in Kanem and 23 percent in Ennedi Ouest.286 Nationally four percent of Chadian children were severely acutely malnourished.287 Chronic malnutrition has increased from 26 percent in 2016 to 32 percent in 2017, exceeding the critical threshold of 40 percent in five regions.288\n\nBesides high levels of food insecurity other contributory factors to malnutrition across the country include: high prevalence of diseases like malaria, respiratory infections and diarrhoea,289 along with low vaccination rates (22 percent of children completed vaccinations) and vitamin A supplementation coverage. Nationally levels of anaemia were very high among children aged 6-59 months (65.6 percent) and among women of reproductive age (42 percent).290\n\nFEWS NET Chad Food Security Outlook Update, September 2018. 281 FEWS NET Chad Key message update, April 2018. 282 FEWS NET Chad Food Security Outlook, June 2018. 283 IOM DTM Round 6, January 2019. 284 WFP Republic of Chad: EFSA in Sahelian Departments affected by 280 rainfall anomalies, June 2018. 285 FEWS NET Chad Key message update, August 2018. 286 Ministère de la Santé.

This number represents a slight increase compared to March-May (787 000),293 but a significant decrease compared to the 2017 lean season when over 1.3 million people were in Crisis (CH Phase 3) and Emergency (CH Phase 4).294 A further decrease was reported between October and December, although Ministère de l'Agriculture et de l'Elevage - Rapport du Niger, March 2018. 294 Cadre Harmonisé, situation de la sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle au Sahel et en Afrique de l'Ouest - Niger, March 2017. 293 around 600 000 people remained in Crisis (CH Phase 3) and Emergency (CH Phase 4) during this period.\n\nBetween June and August, 11 areas were classified in Crisis (CH Phase 3) - including five in the Diffa region - and 49 areas in Stressed (CH Phase 2). Between October and December the number of areas in Crisis decreased to four - all of them in the Tillaberi region - and the number of areas in Stressed (CH Phase 2) to 33.295\n\nIn Diffa, around 118 000 people faced Crisis (CH Phase 3) and Emergency (CH Phase 4) food security outcomes between June and August - compared to 135 000 a year earlier.296 This represented a slight increase compared to March-May 2018, when close to 91 000 people were in urgent need of food, nutrition and livelihood Internal sources - no public document reporting the figures was available as of 12 Dec. 296 Cadre Harmonisé, situation de la sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle au Sahel et en Afrique de l'Ouest - Niger, March 2017. 295 l a c c h a d b a s i n r e g i o n a l c r i s i s n i g e r\n\nMap 28 Niger, CH Acute Food Insecurity Situation, June-August 2018\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 97 assistance.297 Between October and December, the number decreased to around 55 000 people.\n\nWhile the 2017/2018 agricultural campaign was characterized by an above-average cereal aggregate output, the deficit in fodder was such that only 41 percent of livestock needs could be covered.298 This prompted the pastoral lean season to start earlier - in February instead of March - and led to high livestock supply on markets and herd concentration in some areas, which risked triggering conflicts.299 As of March, the situation was critical in 69 communes and deteriorated even further between April and May.300\n\nThe pastoral and crop situation improved from August thanks to favourable rainfall,301 with the exception of Tillabery and Diffa where significant deficits were reported.302 Flooding also affected cropping areas in Maradi and Zinder.303 In November, the 2018/2019 national production prospects indicated an increased cereal output by 13 percent above-average and one percent above the 2017 levels.304\n\nThe Nigerian Naira depreciation negatively affected the purchasing power of those who sold livestock across the border,305 while poor livestock body conditions reportedly pushed down prices.306 This situation compelled increasing numbers of the poorest pastoral households to migrate, sell animals and/or borrow money so that they could buy food.307\n\nDuring the lean season, staple prices on most monitored markets were still above the seasonal average as a result of reduced - although continuous - flows in domestic Ministère de l'Agriculture et de l'Elevage - Rapport du Niger, March 2018. 298 Ministère de l'Agriculture et de l'Elevage - Rapport du Niger, March 2018. 299 FEWS NET Niger Mise à jour sur la sécurité alimentaire, Avril 2018. 300 Ministère de l'Agriculture et de l'Elevage - Rapport du Niger, March 297\n\n2018. 301 FEWS NET Niger Key Message Update, August 2018. 302 FEWS NET Niger Key Message Update, November 2018. 303 FEWS NET Niger Mise à jour sur la sécurité alimentaire, September 2018. 304 FEWS NET Niger Key Message Update, November 2018. 305 FEWS NET Niger Mise à jour sur la sécurité alimentaire, Avril 2018. 306 FEWS NET Niger Key message update, May 2018. 307 FEWS NET Niger Mise à jour sur la sécurité alimentaire, Avril 2018. and cross-border trade. At the same time, demand for livestock was low and terms of trade decreased significantly to the detriment of pastoralist households.308\n\nConflict /insecurity\n\nCivil insecurity also persisted throughout 2018 and even deteriorated in several areas of the country, such as Tahoua and Tillaberi with repeated terrorist attacks and population displacements. It hindered the movement of people and goods, hampering trade and provision of humanitarian assistance, in particular.309 As of December, around 362 000 people were displaced in the Niger, including 175 000 refugees mainly from Nigeria and Mali, 158 000 IDPs and 26 000 returnees.310\n\nDiffa region\n\nIn Diffa, food insecurity continued to be driven by disrupted livelihoods, limited trade opportunities, poor access to rainfed and irrigated fields, limited humanitarian access and continuous flows of IDPs, refugees and returnees.\n\nLow food stocks were reported in markets in early 2018 as a result of insecurity and stagnated domestic and cross-border trade flows. In June, the pastoral crisis was most pronounced in N'Gourti as a result of lack of access to Lake Chad's fall-back areas and to Komadougou because of the security restrictions.311\n\nDespite improvements in economic activity in the first quarter of 2018 people's purchasing power remained well below-average.312 Households surveyed by WFP resorted at least once every five days, on average, to negative coping strategies, such as borrowing food, diminishing the number of daily meals or using credit to buy food.313 Displaced populations added pressure on host communities' already stressed sources of income and food. In December, Diffa hosted almost 119 000 Nigerian refugees in addition to around 104 000 IDPs and 26 000 returnees.314\n\nFEWS NET Niger Perspectives sur la sécurité alimentaire, June 2018. 309 Ibid. 310 UNHCR Population of concern, 31 December, 2018. 311 FEWS NET Niger Perspectives sur la sécurité alimentaire, June 2018. 312 FEWS NET Niger Mise à jour sur la sécurité alimentaire, Avril 2018. 313 WFP Niger mVAM bulletin no. 13, July 2018. 314 UNHCR Population of concern, 31 December 2018. 308\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 998\n\nNational nutrition overview\n\nThe nutrition situation deteriorated with the national GAM prevalence among children under five at 15 percent315 compared to 10.3 percent in 2016.316 The SAM rate was estimated at 3.2 percent versus 1.9 percent in 2016. The regions of Maradi, Tahoua and Zinder had the highest estimates - between 15 and 20 percent. An estimated 1.7 million people needed nutritional assistance, including 380 166 children below five years in need of treatment for SAM.317\n\nChronic malnutrition rates remain 'Critical' with a national prevalence of 48 percent, rising to more than 60 percent in Maradi and Zinder.318\n\nINS Niger.

Just 37 percent of the region's population has access to improved water sources, and 10 percent to basic sanitation.319 Besides food insecurity, the main drivers of malnutrition are the limited access to basic services, the lack of safe water and improved sanitation, and the inadequate diets of young children and women of reproductive age.\n\nDuring the lean season (June-August), around 495 000 people were in Crisis (CH Phase 3) across Cameroon. The Southwest, North, Northwest and Far-North regions were the most affected in terms of magnitude of food insecurity, with the latter two classified in Stressed (CH Phase 2).320\n\nIn the Far-North region, the number of people in need of urgent food, nutrition and livelihood assistance increased from around 111 000 in March-May to over 175 000 during the lean season. A further one million people were classified in Stressed (CH Phase 2) during the lean period. Between these two periods, the number of departments classified in Stressed (CH Phase 2) increased from four to six out of seven.321\n\nThe 2018 aggregated agricultural output is estimated at below-average levels,322 mainly due to the negative impact on agricultural operations of insecurity in northern areas and of the civil unrest that erupted in Anglophone Northwest and Southwest regions, where households abandoned crop fields, and storage infrastructures were destroyed. In these two regions (Northwest and Southwest), over 70 percent of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihoods.323\n\nEnfants de 0 à 59 mois. Octobre-Novembre 2018. 319 WHO.

In the East, 12 percent of households reported being affected by poor rains leading to a lack of food availability in markets.326\n\nIn early 2018, high prices significantly limited the poorest households' access to food in the four monitored regions of Adamawa, East, Far-North and North. More than half of households resorted to food coping strategies such as consuming less expensive food, reducing portion sizes, or diminishing the number of meals per day.327\n\nAs of April, households' food stocks were depleted, forcing the poorest households to become marketdependent earlier than usual. From March staple food (sorghum and maize) prices were higher than average, despite the interdiction from authorities to export cereals, and increased imports of cereals from Nigeria and Chad. Prices of livestock also started falling from March, leading to detrimental terms of trade for pastoralists.328 At the end of 2018, prices were mostly stable as a result of low inflation, maize inflows from Nigeria in the Far-North, supplies from the 2018 harvests and delivery of food assistance,329 except in the urban areas of Northwest and Southwest regions where insecurity and increased exports to Nigeria pushed food prices upwards.330\n\nFar-North region\n\nAlthough Boko Haram incursions and suicide attacks decreased in 2018, the security situation remained precarious in the Far-North.331\n\n2018. 324 OCHA Cameroun: Aperçu Humanitaire (mise à jour pour décembre\n\n2018) 325 UNHCR Operational Portal : country/Cameroon, Dec 2018\n\n[consulted on 11 February 2019] 326 WFP Cameroun Suivi de la sécurité alimentaire Bulletin no. 4, February 2018. 327 Ibid. 328 FEWS NET Cameroon Mise à jour du suivi à distance, April 2018. 329 FAO GIEWS Country Brief Cameroon, November 9, 2018. 330 FEWS NET Cameroon Key Message Update, November 2018. 331 FEWS NET Cameroon Mise à jour du suivi à distance, April 2018.\n\nFalling production, high demand from other regions and companies, and stock depletion weakened food supply. Cereal production for 2017/2018 was 21 percent belowaverage,332 with the situation worse in the departments of Diamaré, Logone-et-Chari and Mayo Sava,333 mainly as a result of the ongoing conflict, displacement, input shortages and depletion of households' already inadequate productive assets. As of March, planting operations remained severely hampered by the Boko Harm insurgency and insecurity.334 Persistent insecurity and cattle-raiding compelled pastoralists to migrate to drier areas in the South.335 However, given the overall improved security conditions and favourable rainfalls in 2018, households' harvests were above average, as of November.336\n\nBy November, the region hosted around 246 000 IDPs and 106 000 returnees337 as well as a rapidly growing number of refugees (100 000 by the end of the year) mainly from the Central African Republic and Nigeria.338 Almost all of them were displaced because of the conflict, while six percent were displaced because of floods, drought and other climate hazards.339\n\nIn early 2018, sorghum and maize prices were higher than their year-earlier levels and higher than the fiveyear average as a result of private companies stockpiling cereals with a view to selling them during the lean season or exporting to Chad and the Sudan, which created market shortages.340\n\nNATIONAL NUTRITION SITUATION\n\nThe 2018 Cameroon Humanitarian Needs Overview estimated that 541 000 people - mainly women and children under five years - were likely to be nutritionally vulnerable and at least 175 600 people were likely to suffer from acute malnutrition across the country in 2018, around 100 000 fewer than in 2017. Those estimated to suffer from acute malnutrition include 17 000 pregnant and lactating women compared to 50 000 in 2017. The number of children under five with acute malnutrition was expected to be around 158 600, including 6 500 the Central African Republic refugees and more than 1 100 Nigerian refugees.\n\nFEWS NET Cameroon Mise à jour du suivi à distance, February 2018. 333 WFP Cameroun Suivi de la sécurité alimentaire Bulletin no. 4, 332\n\nFebruary 2018. 334 FAO GIEWS Country Brief Cameroon, March 26, 2018. 335 FEWS NET Cameroon Mise à jour du suivi à distance, June 2018. 336 FEWS NET Cameroon Key Message Update, November 2018. 337 IOM 2018. 338 UNHCR December 2018. 339 IOM DTM Cameroun Région de l'Extrême-Nord Rapport sur les déplacements Round 16, November 16-23, 2018. 340 WFP Cameroun Suivi de la sécurité alimentaire Bulletin no. 4, February 2018.\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9100\n\n• Farmers had not replenished their lost assets from the preceding two years of drought.\n\n• Acute dry spells and cyclonerelated flooding undermined the 2017/2018 agricultural season.\n\n• Incomplete pasture regeneration, animal diseases and theft constrained livestock production.\n\n• Lack of seeds, fertilizers and technologies constrained agricultural productivity and exposed farmers to climatic events.\n\n• Reduced food availability, a declining exchange rate and rising fuel costs inflated food prices.\n\n20 200 children under five years acutely malnourished, of whom 1 400 affected by SAM.\n\nPoor access to nutrient-rich foods, safe water and health services as well as high levels of food insecurity and diseases affect malnutrition in droughtprone southern districts 30% of children aged 6-23 months received 'Minimum Acceptable Diet' for growth and development.\n\n66% of households lacking access to safe drinking water.\n\n42% of infants (up to 6 months old) exclusively breastfed.\n\n47% of children aged 0-59 months stunted (>30% = very high). l S ur ve y,, 2 01\n\n5 700 persons have been internally displaced in the Grand-Sud mainly as a result of drought and insecurity.\n\nRemittances to Madagascar have more than tripled between 2005 and 2017 and represented 2 percent of the GDP in 2017.\n\nThe number of food-insecure in need of urgent action remained stable mainly as a result of lingering effects of past shocks and 2016 drought.\n\n1.5M IPC PHASE 3 OR ABOVE 1.1M CRISIS 400 000 EMERGENCY\n\n670 000 IPC PHASE 2\n\n24.3M\n\n63% RURAL\n\n37% URBAN\n\nMADAGASCAR SOUTHERN AND SOUTH-EASTERN DISTRICTS\n\n2- 13, S ep t 2 01\n\nTD, at io na l S ur ve y, 2 01 2- 13\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 101 m a d a g a s c a r s o u t h e r n a n d s o u t h - e a s t e r n d i s t r i c t s\n\nFollowing a prolonged period of dry weather conditions between December 2017 and April 2018, staple food production in 2018 fell to well below-average levels in southern and south-western regions, where food insecurity is most prevalent.344\n\nBoth the minor and main harvests were affected.

Absolute poverty levels rose, reducing the population's ability to recover from shocks and mitigate their impacts. Madagascar is among the 10 most vulnerable countries to natural disasters, and considered the most cyclone-exposed country in Africa, with an average of three to four cyclones affecting the country each year.341 With an agricultural system mainly based on rain-fed small-scale subsistence farming, households are very vulnerable to the impact of cyclones, drought and floods. The Grand Sud region suffered several consecutive years of rain shortfalls, further aggravated by the El Niño weather event in 2016 and 2017. In 2018, the political situation was marked by presidential elections in December.\n\nIn 2018, in southern and south eastern districts of Madagascar, the number of people in IPC Phase 3 and above peaked at 1.52 million during the January to March 2018 lean season. This accounted for half of the population analysed and included 392 000 (13 percent) in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and 1.13 million (38 percent) in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). An additional 668 000 people (22 percent) were in Stressed (IPC Phase 2).\n\nThe situation slightly improved between March and June 2018 - the end of the lean season and start of the main harvest - when just over a million needed urgent assistance, including around 350 000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4).342 This positive trend prevailed in the August-October 2018 period, which corresponds to post-harvest and early lean season. Compared to the same period the previous year, food security was better in most districts, in particular in the South East (Taolagnaro, Vangaindrano and Farafangana), while it deteriorated in parts of the South (Ampanihy and Beloha).343\n\nLate 2018 was marked by a deterioration coinciding with the beginning of the lean season with 1.3 million people (28 percent of the population analysed) in IPC Phase 3 or above, including 366 000 in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). The most affected areas were southern districts (Beloha, Ampanihy, Tsihombe and Ambovombe, Betioky, Bekily, Amboasary and parts of Taolagnaro).\n\nWFP.

The elevated price levels particularly affected households that had experienced consecutive years of reduced harvests, which had eroded their coping capacities.350\n\nMaize prices were also at high levels during most of the year in southern regions. For instance, in November 2018, the price of white maize grain was 40 percent higher than the two-year average and 75 percent above 2017 levels in Ambovombe district (Androy region).351\n\nFollowing the low harvests in 2018, households exhausted their food stocks by August, resulting in an earlier-than-normal dependency on market supplies, heightening households' vulnerabilities to sharp price gains. Many households were forced to sell livestock and engage in survival strategies to obtain food, further eroding livelihoods.352At the end of 2018 currency depreciation and rising fuel prices also contributed to raising the cost of transporting food, adding inflationary pressure and affecting households' access to food.353\n\nThe nutritional situation in the south remained concerning. SMART surveys conducted in February and March 2018 in four southern districts (Amboasary, Ampanihy, Beloha and Tsihombe) showed a GAM prevalence ranging from 7.1 percent in Tsihombe to 12.9 percent in Amboasary, with the prevalence of SAM reaching 3.1 percent in Amboasary. These results indicate no significant improvements since the 2017 results, except for the district of Beloha, where there was a slight improvement.354\n\nSADC Madagascar Vulnerability Assessment Committee results 2018, July 2018. 349 FEWS NET Key Message Update, March 2018. 350 Analyse IPC Grand Sud et Grand Sud Est de Madagascar, June 9, 348\n\n2018. 351 FEWS NET Southern Africa Price Bulletin, December 2018. 352 Ibid. 353 FEWS NET Madagascar Food Security Outlook, December 2018-\n\nMay 2019 354 Southern Africa Food and Nutrition Security Working Group Bulletin,\n\nApril 2018\n\nMap 30 Madagascar (southern and south-eastern), IPC Acute food insecurity situation, November 2017-March 2018\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 103\n\nChronic malnutrition rates were also reported to be high ranging from 28 percent in Ampanihy to 41 percent in Amboasary.\n\nIn the south-east, a SMART survey conducted in April 2018 showed that the prevalence of GAM reached 10.4 percent in Nosy Varika. Chronic malnutrition rates were above 45 percent in Farafangana, Mananjary, Nosy Varika and Vangaindrano.\n\nIn 2018, according to a newly piloted Nutrition Surveillance System, 20 234 children were acutely malnourished in the eight drought-prone southern districts (Betioky Atsimo, Ampanithy Ouest, Beloha, Bekily, Tsihombe, Anbovombe-Androy, Amboasary Atsimo, Taolagnaro). Of these, 1 419 were suffering from SAM.355\n\nFactors affecting malnutrition in these eight districts included inadequate access to diverse and nutrient-rich foods; poor access to improved water sources; high levels of food insecurity; high prevalence of diseases such as diarrhoea and malaria; lack of access to health services, including maternal health; and suboptimal breastfeeding practices.356\n\nHumanitarian snapshot: malnutrition, August to November 2018 (OCHA) 356 National survey 2012-2013 355\n\nMap 31 Madagascar, IPC Acute food insecurity situation, November 2018-March 2019\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9104\n\n• Prolonged dry spells cut maize production, particularly in southern and central Malawi - nationally the maize harvest was expected to be 19 percent below 2017.\n\n• Poor farming households generally lack resources to cope and recover from increasingly frequent and intense weather events.\n\n• Having depleted their food stocks households increased their reliance on market purchases earlier than normal.\n\n• Decreased production pushed up maize prices, squeezing household food access, which was already limited by dwindling income sources and low wage rates.\n\n100 000 children under five years acutely malnourished, of whom 35 000 affected by SAM.\n\nPoor maternal nutrition and education, child morbidity, lack of sanitation and dietary diversity, and poor access to healthcare drove malnutrition.\n\n13% of households lacking access to safe drinking water.\n\n61% of infants (up to 6 months old) exclusively breastfed.\n\n37% of children aged 0-59 months stunted (>30% = very high).\n\n-1 6\n\n20 1822 970 refugees and asylum-seekers from the Democratic Republic of the Congo hosted in Malawi; 3 000 asylum-seekers from Mozambique hosted in Malawi.

Even during a good year (2014/2015) 1.3 million people were in need of food assistance, escalating to 6.7 million in 2015/2016 (El Niño year). Over 80 percent of Malawians are smallholder farmers,357 practising rain-fed agriculture, making them highly vulnerable to climate shocks. With a poverty rate of 38 percent,358 households lack the resources to cope with and recover from consecutive shocks, which can significantly erode their resilience and further increase their vulnerabilities to hazards.\n\nApproximately 3.3 million people (22 percent of the population analysed) needed urgent humanitarian food assistance between October and December 2018 to save lives, protect livelihoods, reduce food consumption gaps and acute malnutrition. Of these, 2.9 million faced Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and approximately 449 000 faced Emergency (IPC Phase 4) conditions. A very high number of people (5 million) were in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) with minimally adequate food consumption.\n\nThis reflects a deterioration of the acute food security situation as the year progressed towards the lean season: in July the number of people in IPC Phase 3 and above was 2.2 million.\n\nThe situation was worse in the 12 southern districts. In nine districts (Balaka, Blantyre, Chikhwawa, Mangochi, Mulanje, Mwanza, Neno and Nsanje) around one in three people were classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4).\n\nThis figure marks an improvement compared to the previous year, when the number of food insecure people in need of urgent action peaked at 5.1 million from January-March and the same October-December period in 2016 when there were 6.7 million people in Phase 3 and above.359\n\nUSAID Malawi Agriculture and Food Security (Accessed March 2019) 358 Ibid 359 FSIN.

In the southern region, households were estimated to have 3-4 months of food stock from own production for consumption, while in the central region households were expected to have about nine months.363 As a result, poorer households engaged in multiple coping strategies, including reducing food consumption, increasing livestock sales, as well as increasing the intensity and frequency of other income generating activities, such as selling firewood and charcoal.364 \n\nAlthough low prices of maize were registered at the start of 2018, they began increasing from the second quarter of the year and by November the national average maize price was 25 percent higher on a yearly basis.365 These higher prices, mostly the result of the decrease in production and consequent supply pressure, diminished households' food access and further aggravated food insecurity. Household incomes were also estimated at below-average levels in 2018, reflecting lower crop sales, as well as a decline in agricultural and non-agricultural labour opportunities.366\n\nFood assistance in late October-beginning of November 2018 helped foster a short-term improvement in food security outcomes. However, there were delays in the continuation of interventions.367\n\nMalawi is also hosting more than 23 000 refugees, primarily from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mozambique, the majority of whom are dependent on humanitarian assistance to meet their daily food needs.368\n\nMinistry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development, Malawi, 2018 363 FEWS NET 364 Ibid 365 WFP Southern Africa Region Monthly Food Price Update November 362\n\n2018 366 FEWS NET Malawi Food Security Outlook, June 2018 367 FEWS NET Malawi Key Message Update November 2018 368 UNHCR Operational Portal - Refugee Situations Democratic\n\nRepublic of the Congo/Mozambique December 2018 (consulted 20 March 2019)\n\nThe SMART survey conducted in January/February 2018 in seven livelihood zones indicated that the GAM rate during the peak of the lean season was 1.3 percent, a decrease from 2.2 percent in May 2017 and 4.1 percent in the lean period of December 2016.\n\nThis survey also collected information on adolescents' and adults' nutritional status, showing that underweight was at four percent among adolescents and at 5.3 percent among adults, suggesting a greater burden of undernutrition in older age groups. Increasing rates of overweight (4.4 percent among adolescents and 16.3 percent among adults) were also reported, showing that over-nutrition may be a bigger problem than acute malnutrition in these population groups.369 Micronutrient deficiencies are also prevalent among preschool children with 28 percent showing iron deficiency and more than 60 percent zinc deficiency.370 The most recent data on stunting, reported in the DHS 2015-2016, showed a very high rate at 37 percent.\n\nFactors contributing to the high rates of stunting in Malawi included low birth weight, poor maternal nutrition, low levels of maternal education, child morbidity, lack of sanitation, lack of dietary diversity in under-fives, and poor access to healthcare.371 The DHS 2015-16 found that nearly eight in 10 rural women in Malawi reported at least one problem accessing health care.\n\nAccording to the 2018 SMART survey the morbidity rate was high, at 56 percent among children aged 6 to 59 months and just 11 percent of under-fives were given a minimum acceptable diet.

Although it is now emerging from this period of volatility, high inequality continues to impede inclusive growth.374 Mozambique is one of world's most disasterprone countries, with floods, cyclones and droughts. An estimated 25 percent of the population face mortality risks from such events.375\n\nFrom September-December 2018, about 1.78 million people were classified in IPC Phase 3 and above, with over 1.3 million in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and 0.4 million in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and required urgent action to save lives, protect livelihoods, reduce food consumption gaps and acute malnutrition.376 A very large number of people (7.8 million) were in Stressed (Phase 2).\n\nGaza province was the hardest hit with more than 20 percent of its population in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and above, accounting for 318 000 people. Most other provinces were classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2). These numbers reflect a deterioration of the food security situation in the second half of 2018 compared to early 2018, largely as a result of lower agricultural production.\n\nOverall, the food security situation in 2018 improved compared with 2017, which was marked by the prolonged impact of the 2015-2016 El Niño drought felt in the first quarter of 2017.\n\nThe World Bank. 2015.

Anaemia is also a major health problem, affecting 69 percent of children aged 6-59 months and 54 percent of women of reproductive age across the country.387 Only 45 percent of children with undernutrition are estimated to be receiving proper health care.388\n\nWater and sanitation services are poor: according to the DHS 2011 just 51 percent of people had access to improved drinking water and 22 percent had access to improved sanitation.

It is prone to multiple hazards including floods and drought. Although Sindh has not experienced a major flood since 2015, drought/ drought-like conditions have been prevailing since in the arid south-eastern and western areas of the province, resulting in successive crop failures and significant livestock losses, with severe consequences 2013 for the livelihoods of the local population.390 While nearly 55 percent of Pakistan's rural population is poor based on the multidimensional poverty index (MPI),391 poverty levels are even higher in Sindh where 76 percent of the rural population is multi-dimensionally poor.\n\nAlmost half (46 percent) of households were moderately food insecure and more than a third (36 percent) severely food insecure, according to the Consolidated Approach to Reporting Indicators of Food Security (CARI). Prevalence of food insecurity was higher among households in desert/arid areas and women-headed households.392\n\nThe majority of surveyed households had either poor or borderline food consumption: 18 percent had acceptable food consumption, 41 percent poor consumption and another 41 percent borderline.\n\nFAO GIEWS country brief 391 MPI was calculated from 15 indicators related to education, health 390 and standard of living.

Own production of cereals for household consumption was only sufficient for about 2.8 months. Half of farming households reported water not being available at all for agriculture, while 30 percent reported less water availability than in 2017.\n\nBesides lack of water to irrigate crops, farming households face lack of access to high-yielding seeds, fertilizer, agricultural services, tools and credit. The drought led to the deaths and distress sales of livestock because of diseases, lack of water and fodder. Some 96 percent of surveyed livestock-holders reported lack of fodder for animals, 89 percent reported lack of drinking water, and 83 percent livestock diseases.\n\nMap 35 Pakistan - Sindh Province, drought notified areas\n\nSource: Natural Disasters Consortium, January 2019\n\nDisclaimer The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.

Sale of agricultural produce reduced over the six months preceding the survey, particularly in desert/arid areas. Average monthly income of surveyed households fell by 11 percent between April and October 2018. Women-headed households had lower average monthly income than those headed by men.395\n\nThe surveyed households spent a major proportion of their income on food purchases, compromising their spending on other basic needs such as healthcare. Overall, 36 percent spent a very high share (more than 75 percent of total household expenditure) on food, while 31 percent spent a high share (65-75 percent of total expenditure) on food. 396\n\nPrices of wheat grain and wheat flour, the country's main staples, increased for the fifth consecutive month in December 2018, reflecting seasonally tightening market availabilities and strong exports in recent months.

In the Umerkot and Tharparker districts the acute malnutrition rate increased from 18 percent to 29 percent and 23 percent respectively from the IPC analysis of 2017.398 Severe acute malnutrition rates were also very high, estimated at 10 percent and 12 percent in Badin and Kambar districts respectively.\n\nThe main factors contributing to acute malnutrition included very poor food consumption with the majority of households with low dietary diversity, high prevalence of diseases (over 80 percent among children under five years of age), and poor sanitation infrastructures (more than four out of five households within the eight districts do not have access to a toilet.\n\nAccess to healthcare was also critical in these districts, with households reporting challenges as long distance to healthcare facilities, poor road infrastructure, lack of transport and high cost of services.

Food insecurity levels continued to be alarmingly high in Gaza where 68 percent of households were severely or moderately food insecure, in contrast to 12 percent in the West Bank.401 Comparing with the 2013 SEFSec Survey, the prevalence of food insecurity in the West Bank was 18.6 percent (a reduction of seven percentage points in 2018) and 61 percent in Gaza (an increase in 7.5 percentage points). Food insecurity increased particularly in Hebron, the Middle Area and Rafah governorates with over 20 000 more people becoming food insecure in each governorate.402\n\nIn 2018, there were about 1.4 million Palestine registered refugees residing in Gaza, and around 837 000 in the West Bank. Palestine refugees accounted for 43 percent of the total population - or 70 percent of the population of Gaza and 33 percent of the population of the West Bank. In Gaza, 67 percent of refugees and 70 percent of non-refugees were food-insecure, and in the West Bank 11 percent of refugees and 14 percent of non-refugees were food-insecure.403\n\nOther populations particularly vulnerable to food insecurity included female-headed households and pregnant and lactating women. Farmers and herders were also vulnerable because of their exposure to conflict and dependence on small-scale production to meet their food needs.404\n\nPCBS, The Levels Of Living In Palestine, 2017 400 HNO 2019 Palestine 401 HNO 2019 Palestine using CARI 402 HNO 2019 Palestine and HNO 2018 Palestine (comparing figures 399 between different governorates). 403 SEFsec 2018 Preliminary Results PCBS Ramallah, 10th December\n\n2018 404 HNO 2019 Palestine\n\nFP /W\n\nIS SA\n\nM N\n\nA SS\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9118\n\nThe economy, infrastructure, livelihoods and public services have all been severely damaged by the three escalations of conflict in the Gaza strip since late 2008.

In Gaza, the unemployment rate was 54 percent in the second quarter of the year, substantially higher than the relatively stable rate of about 18 percent in the West Bank over the past five years.410 With heads of households in Gaza and the West Bank reporting an average of 6.4 and 8.8 days of work in the month of November 2018, households were only earning an average of 177 USD in Gaza and 320 USD in the West Bank.411\n\nIn Gaza, power cuts of 18-20 hours a day impeded the delivery of basic services and crippled productive activity. The coastal aquifer, Gaza's sole water source, has been virtually depleted by over-extraction and the intrusion of seawater, forcing the people to buy trucked water, often of poor quality, at up to 20 times the expense of water from the network.412\n\nAlthough food prices did not increase much in Palestine overall in 2018 (by 0.01 percent between June 2017 and June 2018413), persistent poverty, low purchasing power and debt have limited households' ability to afford their basic food and living needs. Consequently, households reported using negative coping strategies to compensate for the gap in their food needs, even for those receiving food assistance.414\n\nWorld Bank. 2018.

Most state services ceased in the 1990s, affecting education, health and food production. Since 2012, Somalia has slowly emerged from a \"failed\" to a \"fragile\" state with the establishment of the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS). In 2013, the FGS and the international community endorsed the 'New Deal for Somalia' aiming to rebuild the country, stabilize institutions and develop the federal state.420 Many political, social and economic challenges remain. Half of Somalis live in poverty.421 In 2016 and 2017, a drought led to large-scale food insecurity, affecting more than six million people, although humanitarian assistance prevented many households from facing catastrophic conditions.\n\nAccording to the IPC Acute Food Insecurity analysis conducted in January 2018, between February and June 2018 an estimated 2.7 million people were in IPC Phase 3 and above in the absence of humanitarian food assistance (HFA). Of these 2.2 million were in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and 496 000 in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). Even though this was estimated excluding the mitigating effects of planned HFA, the 2018 peak number in IPC Phases 3 and 4 represents a slight decrease compared with the July 2017 peak figure of 3.3 million when the country was in the grip of a severe drought.\n\nAnother 2.7 million Somalis were classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) between February and June 2018, and required livelihood support to prevent future food security deterioration.\n\nOf greatest concern were pastoralist areas in northern parts of Awdal and Woqooyi Galbeed regions, in southern parts of Sanaag region, and in eastern parts of Mudug and Galgaduud regions, where Emergency (IPC Phase 4) levels of food insecurity were likely through June.\n\nFor the period August-December 2018, the number of people in IPC Phase 3 and above was expected to drop to 1.6 million in the absence of HFA. However, pressing humanitarian needs persisted among 17 000 people estimated to be facing Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) levels of food insecurity.\n\nWFP Somali country brief 421 World Bank 420\n\nIL T\n\nA X\n\nTA\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9122\n\nRecovery from the devastation caused by drought that spanned four consecutive rainy seasons in 2016 and 2017 has been challenged by intense climatic events.

By June, flooding had affected 830 000 people and displaced 290 000.422 In May, Cyclone Sagar brought torrential rainfall and flooding to the northwest along the coast of Puntland and flash flooding in the Bari region, resulting in livestock deaths, mass displacement and the destruction of farms, property and infrastructure, including roads, fishing boats, medical facilities, boreholes and water wells.

As a result the cereal output was estimated at almost 60 percent above the average of the previous five years.424\n\nAcute food insecurity remained prevalent among pastoralist households who lost most of their animals during the 2016-2017 drought, among those affected by the April-May flooding and others who were affected by large-scale and protracted displacement due to a combination of conflict and natural hazards.

Durable peace could allow the government to tackle the underlying causes of the country's macroeconomic crisis, improve food production, boost employment, build infrastructure and diversify the economy. While the intensity of conflict reduced in 2018, with clashes contained to certain regions, vulnerable people continued to experience the impacts of it.438 In addition, more than 600 000 people returned to their homestead resulting in another round of challenges for recovery and rehabilitation.\n\nAs of September 2018, corresponding to the end of the lean season/green harvest period, the number of people facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse acute food insecurity reached 6.06 million people, accounting for nearly 60 per cent of the population.

Most counties in the Greater Upper Nile, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap and parts of Eastern Equatoria were expected to reach Critical (IPC Phase 4) levels.\n\nBy September, acute malnutrition levels had improved and were slightly better than during the same period the previous year with no county reporting GAM rates above 30 percent. Nutrition was expected to further improve between October and December 2018 thanks to the seasonal availability of local produce, increased\n\nIPC country analysis 451 availability of fish and milk, and better access to markets and key services.\n\nLevels of acute malnutrition are attributed to severe food insecurity, poor access to health and nutrition services, high illness levels, extremely poor diets and poor sanitation and hygiene.452 Only 12 percent of 6-23 month olds are given meals frequently enough and 45 percent of infants aged under six months are exclusively breastfed. Sanitation levels are extremely low with two thirds of the population defecating in the open.453 Insecurity continues to affect humanitarian assistance, with reports of confiscation of nutrition supplies.

This represents an increase compared to 2017 as the prevalence of people in need of urgent assistance rose from nine to 14 percent.460 A further 13.7 million people were classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2).\n\nThe states of Darfur were of particular concern as they accounted for nearly half (43 percent) of the population in IPC Phase 3 and above. North Darfur, alone, accounted for one million people. The states of North, East, Central and West Darfur and Blue Nile were classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), and two localities (Tawila and Fashir) were classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). The states of Red Sea and Kassala were also facing particularly high prevalence of food-insecure people.461\n\nThe food security situation seasonally improved in late 2018 as newly-harvested crops became available, but the number classified in IPC Phase 3 and above was still 5.7 million, accounting for 13 percent of the population.462 This was almost 50 percent higher than the same period the previous year, indicating a severe deterioration of the food security situation in 2018.\n\nFAO GIEWS Update The Sudan, September 11, 2018 456 Sudan IPC Technical Working Group.

An upsurge in demand for US dollars from importers, coupled with limited foreign currency reserves, resulted in a sharp depreciation of the local currency in the parallel market that triggered a significant rise in the general inflation rate. In early 2018, following the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the government removed wheat subsidies. This, in turn, increased demand for millet and sorghum as substitutes for wheat and exerted additional upward pressure on cereal prices.464\n\nIn an effort to narrow the gap between the official and the parallel exchange rates, the Central Bank of Sudan devalued the official exchange rate twice during 2018, thus intensifying inflationary pressures. Food prices and inflation were also underpinned by fuel shortages, which pushed up production and transport costs. In November 2018, the year-on-year inflation rate reached almost 70 percent, compared to about 25 percent in November 2017, and in December prices of sorghum, millet and wheat, despite the re-introduction of wheat subsidies, were at record levels and up to three times their yearearlier levels.465\n\nBy the end of the year around 1.1 million466 refugees were in the Sudan, most of them escaping the effects of conflict and insecurity in South Sudan as well as Eritrea, the Syrian Arab Republic and Ethiopia.\n\nThe Sudan also received over 30 000 arrivals in 2018.467 The refugee population remained among the most vulnerable because of lack of income-earning opportunities, especially during the lean season.468\n\nIbid 464 FAO GIEWS Special Alert no. 342 The Sudan, January 26, 2018 465 FAO GIEWS Food Price Monitoring and Analysis bulletin, December 463\n\n2018 466 UNHCR December 2018 467 UNHCR Sudan population dashboard Refugees from South Sudan,\n\nOctober 31, 2018 468 WFP Sudan Food Security Monitoring, May 2018\n\nThe impact of conflict and population displacement in Darfur fuelled persisting conflicts between herders and farmers over land and natural resources.469\n\nIn 2017, aggregate cereal production was estimated at 5.2 million tonnes, about 10 percent above the five-year average but 40 percent lower than the bumper 2016 harvest.470 The output contraction was mainly because of a decline in the area planted with sorghum and millet after farmers switched to more profitable cash crops, mainly sesame and cotton, and to drought-induced production shortfalls in northern Gedaref, North Darfur and Kassala states, where cereal production was 65- 90 percent lower than in the previous year.471\n\nHeavy June-September seasonal rains triggered widespread floods and displacements, affecting over 222 000 people across 15 of the Sudan's 18 states.472\n\nIn Kassala, as of April 2018, the fodder gap was estimated at around 3.5 million tonnes, which significantly affected the livestock sector and the livelihoods of pastoral communities.473\n\nThe Sudan has experienced persistently high levels of undernutrition since records began in 1987.

Some 29 percent of returnees are adopting emergency coping strategies compared to 19 percent reported across all groups at national level.\n\nThe HNO also highlights the vulnerability of 600 000481 farming households and 200 000 livestock breeder households.\n\nWFP mobile surveys of nine governorates show that 27 percent of households were highly vulnerable or vulnerable to food insecurity in January-June 2018 compared with 40 percent during the same period in 2017.482\n\nAugust 2018 481 Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform 482 CFSAM Oct 2018 480\n\nW A\n\nA W\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9138 feeding just one child a day for households that could not feed all their children at once.485\n\nBetween January and June 2018 1.3 million people were newly displaced, forced out of their homes by fighting and/or loss of livelihoods.486 While 6.2 million were displaced within the country - the largest internal displacement in the world 487 -1.2 million IDPs returned to their area of origin in the first 10 months of 2018.488 Besides the pull factor of improved safety in their community of origin, a significant push factor was the lack of basic services and lack of safety/security at the location of displacement.489\n\nMonthly telephone surveys carried out by WFP's mVAM unit throughout 2018 consistently showed that IDPs and returnees were more food insecure and more likely to employ food-related coping strategies than residents.\n\nThe worst drought in 30 years was followed by heavy, out-of-season rains. Coupled with the effects of conflict, the Syrian Arab Republic's wheat production hit its lowest level since 1989. In 2018 it was about two-thirds of 2017 levels and less than one-third of pre-conflict 2002-2011 averages.490 This marks a shortfall of 1.2 million metric tonnes to meet domestic requirements (food use) of 3.4 million metric tonnes.491\n\nIn north-east Syria, most of the wheat and barley crops failed because of drought. There were substantial crop losses in Faqqa, Hama, Homs and Rural Damascus and Dar'a.492 Livestock farmers had to contend with damaged and reduced pasture and increased fodder prices493 leading to irreversible coping strategies.494\n\nThe import sanctions imposed on the Syrian Arab Republic have contributed to substantial reduction in the availability of quality inputs and a severe shortfall in certified seed for the 2018/2019 winter planting season.495\n\nWFP mVAM Bulletin, March 2018 486 FAO/WFP Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission to the Syrian 485\n\nArab Republic (CFSAM) Oct 2018 487 UNHCR, Nov 2018 488 3RP Regional Strategic Review, 2019-2020 489 https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/picking-pieces- realities-return-and-reintegration-north-east-syria 490 CFSAM Oct 2018 491 HNO 2019 492 GIEWS Oct 2018 493 CFSAM Oct 2018 494 HNO 2019 495 Ibid\n\nThe HNO 2019 highlights the inseparable link between poverty and food insecurity in the Syrian Arab Republic. An estimated 83 percent of Syrians live below the upper (moderate) poverty line versus 28 percent in 2010.496 According to the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI),497 which takes into account health, education and basic needs-related indicators, the national poverty rate in the Syrian Arab Republic is 39 percent. Unemployment has risen to 55 percent and purchasing power has declined to a tenth of pre-crisis levels. A monthly food ration with staple items costs at least 80 percent of an unskilled labourer's monthly salary and 50-80 percent of a public service employee's monthly salary.498\n\nIn October 78 percent of WFP mVAM survey respondents said unemployment was their main challenge. The second most reported issue was the high cost of rent, especially in Aleppo, Damascus, Lattakia and Rural Damascus.499\n\nFood prices fell across all governorates thanks in part to improved security and market access compared to the previous year. However, commodity prices were still seven times higher than the five-year pre-crisis average and there were still areas, such as Idleb and south Deirez-Zor, where market access remained very difficult.500 The main constraints to reinvigorating markets remain the high exchange rate, steep transport costs, and low demand due to high unemployment rates and limited purchasing power. Every second household purchased food on credit, which was more common among IDPs, returnees, female-headed and rural households. 501\n\nThe upper poverty line is equal to per capita expenditure on basic food needs (food poverty line) plus per capita non-food expenditure of households whose per capita food expenditure is close to the food poverty line. 497 In the global MPI, a person is identified as multidimensionally poor or MPI poor if they are deprived in at least one third of the weighted MPI indicators: health, education and living standards. 498 All data in this paragraph from HNO 2019 499 https://docs.wfp.org/api/documents/WFP-0000100853/download/ 500 CFSAM Oct 2018 501 HNO 2019 496\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 139\n\nSMART surveys and nutrition surveillance in 2018 generally showed GAM rates under five percent. Around 92 000 children under five years of age were acutely malnourished, approximately 19 000 of them severely so.\n\nHowever, in Eastern Ghouta, the GAM rate reached nearly 12 percent. GAM rates also significantly deteriorated where there were newly displaced populations and in hard-to-reach areas. In Ar-Raqqa they increased from 4.6 percent in January to 11.9 percent in June and in Idlib from 1.5 percent to four percent.502\n\nSMART surveys conducted in 2015/2016 indicated the level of chronic malnutrition as measured by under-five stunting (12.7 percent) in 11 out of the 14 governorates.503 By 2018, pockets of particularly high stunting levels were identified in some localities, including Eastern Ghouta (36 percent) and Tel Abiyad (32 percent). Increasing stunting levels are potentially driven by longer-term inadequate dietary intake,\n\nHumanitarian Needs Overview 2019 503 Humanitarian Needs Overview 2018 502 repeated infections in younger children, poor feeding practices (just 24 percent of infants are exclusively breastfed for six months in 11 governorates),504 and inadequate complementary feeding.\n\nOf great concern is moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) among pregnant and lactating women (PLW), which more than doubled in one year. Nutrition screenings in July 2018 reported 10 064 cases.505 Lack of access to health services and negative coping mechanisms, such as meal reductions, are among the contributing factors to this deterioration.\n\nMore generally, limited access to safe water, inadequate healthcare provision, poor sanitation, and food insecurity, especially among displaced populations, returnees and in newly accessible areas, are negative influences.\n\nIbid 505 Ibid 504\n\nMap 49 The Syrian Arab Republic, distribution of people in need of food security and agriculture assistance, 2018\n\nSource: OCHA, March 2019\n\nDisclaimers The designations employed and the presentation of material on this map do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the Secretariat of the United Nations concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.

Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt host around 5.6 million registered Syrian refugees, although the total estimated number, which includes Government estimates of unregistered Syrian refugees and Syrians residing in host countries under alternative legal frameworks, is far higher (7.2 million). Around one million have been born in displacement and 70 percent of people in need in the region are women or children.506\n\nThere was no large-scale arrival of refugees in neighbouring countries over the course of 2018 as borders and admission practices remained closely managed. At the same time, none of these countries saw a substantial decrease in the registered Syrian refugee population (as of November 2018 there were almost 43 000 returns).\n\nThe welfare profile of Syrian refugees did not change significantly over the past year, with current estimates for poverty rates continuing to exceed 60 percent in most host countries. Poverty for refugees also manifests itself as low educational attainment, sub-par health and nutrition outcomes, exposure to physical insecurity and natural hazards, and substandard living conditions.\n\nIn many host countries, Syrian refugees lack legal employment opportunities and depend on emergency food assistance, while an estimated 3.9 million vulnerable host community members face deepening socio-economic challenges, particularly through lack of livelihoods and economic opportunities, and basic services. In Jordan, where 83 percent of refugees live outside camps in urban areas, 57 percent of working age Syrian refugees are unemployed and 80 percent of Syrian refugees outside of camps are below the poverty line. In Egypt 85 percent of registered Syrian refugees are unable to meet their basic needs.\n\nMost host countries are also experiencing persistently sluggish growth - exacerbated by the crisis in the region - that has left per capita incomes near stagnant since 2008. Turkey, which hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, the highest number in the world, is of particular concern because of increasing inflation, a weakening currency and unemployment rates of around 10 percent.507\n\n506 3RP Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan 2019-20 507 Internal note - Turkish economic slowdown: implications on WFP's work, WFP VAM\n\nThe combination of rising inflation and weakening domestic currency is likely to exacerbate poverty levels (28.7 percent of the Turkish population in the country already live under the poverty line). Although the Emergency Social Safety Net (ESSN) run by the European Union, the Turkish government, WFP and the Turkish Red Crescent, assists over 1.45 million registered refugees monthly508 inflation rates increased the cost of the food basket509 by 33 percent between September 2017 and 2018.510\n\nWhile the levels of social tension between refugees and host communities have remained relatively stable on a macro level across the region, the combined effects of these socio-economic conditions could lead to increased fatigue among host communities in some countries.\n\nLebanon hosts the largest concentration of refugees per capita and the fourth largest refugee population in the world, with 1.5 million Syrian refugees according to Government of Lebanon estimates, almost one million of whom were registered with UNHCR by the end of September 2018. The sixth VASyR found that while food security for Syrian refugees improved in the last year thanks to the extensive humanitarian response in the country, one third (34 percent) of Syrian refugee households still remained moderately to severely foodinsecure.511\n\nHigher levels of food insecurity continued to be associated with higher economic vulnerability. Although poverty levels decreased, 69 percent remained below the poverty line and just over half (51 percent) still did not reach the Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket512 threshold. Nearly nine out of 10 households acquired debt and 82 percent borrowed money during the three months prior to the survey.\n\nWFP assistance and informal debt continued to be key sources of income for Syrian households in Lebanon, indicating the challenges refugees faced in covering essential needs through employment. Unemployment among the labour force was reported at 40 percent rising to 61 percent for women. Unemployment rates in Akkar and the South were more than double those of BaalbekEl Hermel and Mount Lebanon. Sixty-one percent of Syrian refugees aged 15 to 24 were not employed, not in education, and not attending any training (NEET).\n\nSource: The ESSN Card 509 The food basket represents the monthly minimum cost of a 508 nutritiously balanced diet 510 WFP Turkey, ESSN Market Bulletin Q3 2018 511 VASyR Lebanon 2018 using CARI 512 Ibid\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 141 among refugees living in host communities they were significantly lower (6.4 percent).514 Stunting rates among refugees living in Lebanon were 18.6 percent.515\n\nThe Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees in Lebanon 2018 found the average number of meals consumed per day increased for children under five since the previous year.

Excessive rains between April and June disrupted planting operations and caused flooding and waterlogging in lowland areas, forcing farmers to re-plant. Subsequently, erratic and below-average rainfall in July and August affected the establishment and development of re-planted crops.524 As a result, cereal production was estimated by FEWS NET at 60-80 percent below-average, with the lowest output registered in Kotido and Kaabong districts.\n\nIn Karamoja fields tend to be very small, farmers lack resources for inputs (e.g., seeds and labour), and crops are rainfed. Cropland expansion is directly competing and compromising pasture areas critical for livestockbased livelihoods.\n\nLivestock productivity declined earlier than usual following the accelerated seasonal deterioration of pasture and water resources. As a result, seasonal livestock migration to traditional dry season grazing areas began one month earlier than normal, in October. This had a negative impact on milk availability and consumption for transhumant household members remaining at the homestead.\n\nFAO GIEWS country brief 524\n\nLand-locked Uganda is East Africa's breadbasket and a major exporter of grains. However, pockets of food insecurity still persist, particularly in the north and northeastern semi-arid Karamoja region. Peace and stability was largely restored in 2006, but protracted conflict persists in neighbouring countries. Consequently, Uganda has become the third largest refugee-hosting country in the world after Turkey and Pakistan, with over a million refugees living in settlements.517, 518 Nationally poverty rates rose from 19.7 percent in 2012/13 to 27 percent in 2016/17.519 Although the fertility rate is falling, Ugandan women still have on average 5.6 children520 giving it one of the highest population growth rates on Earth (3.3 percent521).\n\nBetween September and December 2018, an estimated 1.1 million people were in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), 522 mostly among the refugee population and in Karamoja.\n\nFEWS NET analysed that most resident Ugandan households faced Minimal (IPC Phase 1) levels of acute food insecurity throughout 2018 as a result of normal food availability and improved food access. However, the majority of poor households in Karamoja region faced Stressed (IPC Phase 2) conditions throughout 2018. Between April and June, almost all districts in the region were classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) - except Abim. The situation improved in September in some areas such as in the western parts of Kotido and Kaabong, as well as in the south-western parts of the region. However, during the last quarter in localized hotspots, such as in Kotido and Kaabong, about 10-13 percent of the population were in Crisis (IPC Phase 3).523\n\nRefugees living in settlements received food assistance and met their minimum food needs, enabling Stressed! (IPC Phase 2!) outcomes. In the absence of food assistance, most refugees faced Crisis (IPC 3) levels of acute food insecurity, according to FEWS NET.\n\nWFP Uganda country brief July 2018 518 UNHCR 519 Uganda Bureau of Statistics September 2017 520 World Bank 521 Ibid 522 Internal source: FEWS NET internal unpublished figures as of 25 517\n\nJanuary 2019 523 FEWS NET Key Message Update January 2018; Food Security\n\nOutlooks: April 2018, June 2018, September 2018\n\nFP /H\n\nU G\n\nU TH\n\nER FO\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9144\n\nIn bimodal rainfall areas covering most of the country, production of the first season harvest, gathered in June and July, was estimated at above-average levels as yields benefited from exceptionally abundant March-May seasonal rains. Torrential rains triggered floods in several areas, but crop losses were limited and mainly localized in Mount Elgon, Teso and Kigezi areas. Abundant rains also suppressed the spread of fall armyworm outbreaks.\n\nIn October, below-average rains delayed planting and affected crop establishment in several areas, while in eastern highlands torrential rains triggered flash floods and landslides. Enhanced rainfall since mid-November lifted crop prospects, but localized crop losses were expected in some eastern, central and south-western districts, where the early season dryness was most severe, and the aggregate crop output was expected at slightly below-average levels.525\n\nThe influx of refugees in Uganda (more than 1.2 million verified as of December 2018), mainly fleeing conflict in South Sudan and The Democratic Republic of the Congo, has strained the resources of the humanitarian system and put enormous pressure on host communities and the environment.\n\nFAO, Crop Prospects and Food Situation, March 2019 525\n\nMap 51 Uganda, IPC Acute Food Insecurity Phase Classification, October 2018-January 2019\n\nNote: This is FEWS NET IPC compatible product, which is generated through the application of the full set of IPC tools and procedures, with the exception of technical consensus.\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 145\n\nMost refugees reside in designated refugee settlements across 11 districts mainly in the North and West Nile regions, which are among the poorest and most undeveloped areas in the country, and in Kampala. The Government allows freedom of movement and provides land to refugees settling in designated areas, the right to work and access to national services. However, both refugees and host communities are challenged by the lack of access to cultivable land and water, poor market connectivity, limited skills and few formal employment opportunities. 526 For all refugees, humanitarian food assistance along with minimal levels of own crop production, petty trade, and some remittances remain the key sources of food and income.\n\nLow food availability and reduced food access in the northern Karamoja sub-region strained households' capacity to cope. Poor households in Kotido and Kaabong districts were the worst-off, commonly buying and/or borrowing food on credit and/or from friends and relatives, reducing food portion size, and restricting adult meals to preserve enough food for children. By November, most poor households had already depleted their stocks from the harvest and were primarily relying on markets for their food needs, with some supplementing this with wild fish, game and vegetables when available. While surplus bimodal supply from other areas of the country mitigated staple food commodity price increases through September, sorghum prices rose 68 percent above year-earlier levels in Kotido in October and 18 percent above the five-year average. 527\n\nMost regions have GAM rates below five percent, except for Karamoja (10.4 percent) and North West (10 percent) regions, according to the most recent national nutrition estimates.528 The stunting prevalence is high, at 29 percent, with estimates ranging from 18 percent in Kampala to 41 percent in Tooro.529\n\nFactors contributing to persistently high levels of acute malnutrition in Karamoja include food insecurity,\n\nUNHCR 526\n\nFEWS NET Food Security Outlook December 2018-May 2019 528 DHS 2016 529 Ibid 527 diseases and inappropriate child caring practices (just eight percent of children between 6-23 months receive an appropriate diet for growth and development).530 Nevertheless, figures seem to be improving in this region, which has been the focus of sustained action from the government and international agencies. In districts with the historically highest rates of GAM, estimates from July 2018 were lower than during the same period in 2017 (10.6 percent versus 18.5 percent in Kotido and 12 percent versus 18.5 percent in Moroto).531\n\nThe prevalence of acute respiratory infection among children in Karamoja is more than double that of other regions in Uganda. Children experience persistent diarrhoea because of poor sanitation (two in three households do not have a toilet). High fertility, teenage pregnancy and inadequate birth spacing have a negative impact on the nutritional status of children, adolescent girls and women.\n\nIn the West Nile region the GAM prevalence increased from 6.2 percent in 2011 to 10.4 percent in 2016.532 This deterioration was related to the increased influx of refugees and asylum seekers from neighbouring countries. A Food Security and Nutrition Assessment conducted in the districts hosting refugees in October 2017 showed GAM reached 10.1 percent in Lamwo and 10.8 percent in Arua.533\n\nSince the beginning of 2018, Uganda has suffered outbreaks of cholera, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever and rubella. However, no Ebola case has been reported despite the ongoing arrival of refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and regular trade activities across the border.534\n\nUNICEF, WFP and IBFAN Uganda.

Some 78 percent of households in these areas applied negative coping strategies - the highest level since April 2016 and up from 53 percent in June 2017.536\n\nAdditionally, 59 percent of households in the GCA within five kilometres of the LoC (and 57 percent overall) were marginally food secure,537 and at risk of greater food insecurity if there was an escalation in conflict, economic shocks, drastic shrinking of humanitarian assistance, or they had to contend with any other shocks.\n\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioners for Human Rights (OHCHR) 2018, Report on Human Rights in Ukraine 536 Food Security & Socio-Economic Trend Analysis - Eastern Ukraine 29 March 2018 537 REACH Winter Assessment of Government-Controlled Areas within 5km of the Contact Line, February 2018 (CARI methodology) 535\n\nA TI\n\nA S\n\nTO LI\n\nEN K\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9148\n\nDRIVERS OF ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY\n\nTwo million people live close to the contact line on both sides where they have to contend with landmines and other explosives on a regular basis. Shelling and smallarms fire regularly damage homes, hospitals, schools, roads, and water supply systems.\n\nInfrastructural disruptions between GCA and NGCA affect the demand for goods and services. In 2018 1.1 million crossed the contact line each month, a 15 percent increase since 2017, to access pensions, hospitals, markets, social services, or to visit friends or family. Over half of these were over the age of 60, crossing mainly to collect their pensions in GCA. They often wait in long lines for several hours at checkpoints, and sometimes stay overnight, in a volatile environment with shelling and landmine contamination. 541\n\nThe conflict has paralysed economic activities in Ukraine's once-thriving industrial region of Donbas, seriously affecting people's wellbeing and living standards. Rural families' access to farmland has been curtailed by widespread mine contamination. With transport connections damaged and disrupted by hostilities, and prices of seeds, fertilizers, tools and livestock fodder very high, pursuing agricultural activities is extremely difficult. In conflict-affected areas, production of food crops has remained well below pre-crisis levels, constraining food availability and access.542\n\nUkraine HNO 2019 542 FAO.

Unemployment in the region has increased over the past four years and is higher than in the rest of Ukraine. In Donetska oblast, the unemployment rate has doubled since 2013, while in Luhanska Oblast, it has almost tripled.543 There is a direct link between food insecurity and unemployment in Ukraine.544 Some 37 percent of households in the GCA, near the contact line, and headed by an unemployed 40-60 year old were food-insecure in February 2018.545\n\nDespite some socio-economic improvements in 2018, including pension reform, and real salary growth reaching pre-crisis levels,546 some vulnerable groups (e.g. pensioners with the minimum pension and the unemployed) were not able to benefit as household expenditures (food and utilities) grew faster than income levels.547\n\nElderly men and women are particularly vulnerable as they have specific health and nutritional needs, and are highly prone to economic insecurity. Their pensions do not cover the rising cost of basic needs, particularly during the winter.548\n\nThe cost of the WFP monitored food basket549 increased significantly between June 2017 and June 2018, when it reached the highest historical level of UAH 996 (approx.

Kilocalorie requirements increase and access to food becomes restricted as prices increase. Bad road conditions make basic services even more difficult to access.551\n\nUkraine HNO 2019 544 REACH.

IDPs' coping strategies differed in their severity, from stress strategies such as borrowing money, to emergency strategies such as selling property.\n\nHost communities also observed an increase in rental and food prices, and downward pressure on wages and employment opportunities. Displacement has at times caused tension between IDPs and host communities, risking undermining social cohesion.\n\nShelling of water, sanitation, electrical and heating infrastructure is threatening access to safe drinking water for 3.2 million people in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, which, alongside low immunization rates, raises the risk of communicable disease outbreaks. Two-thirds of health facilities in areas closest to the 'contact line' have been damaged, hindering people's access to healthcare and cutting off the regular supply of medicines and equipment for those highly dependent upon life-saving care. As years of conflict pass, healthcare costs (transport, diagnostics, and medications) have increased. Over 1 500 healthcare professionals have left the conflictaffected areas since 2014.\n\nDonetska and Luhanska oblasts are still among the most-affected by HIV/AIDS in Ukraine. Issues such as displacement, migration, and widespread multidrugresistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) compound systemic gaps and contribute to higher rates of HIV and TB in the conflictaffected areas and beyond.\n\nThis figure is somewhat distorted as a number of the registered IDPs are displaced for registration purposes, which is due to Ukraine's IDP policy which links access to social payments and pensions to their IDP registration. 553 IOM 552\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9150\n\n• Multiple impacts of escalating conflict included destruction of livelihoods, houses and infrastructure, mass displacement, and currency devaluation.\n\n• Lack of foreign currency and high import taxes cut imported food supplies while movement restrictions and insecurity disrupted markets.\n\n• The average cost of the monthly minimum food basket was 140 percent higher than before the crisis.\n\n• Lack of work, low wages and non-payment of public salaries depressed purchasing power.\n\n• The small proportion of food produced domestically was constrained by rainfall shortages and cyclones, lack of inputs and high fuel costs.\n\n2M children under five years acutely malnourished, of whom 357 500 affected by SAM.\n\nConflict and economic collapse have resulted in the breakdown of the health system and the spread of preventable diseases, exacerbating the dire nutrition situation.\n\n10% of infants (up to 6 months old) exclusively breastfed.\n\n47% of children aged 0-59 months stunted (>30% = very high).

Following week-long peace talks in Stockholm the two warring parties committed to an immediate ceasefire in Hudaydah and its surrounding governorate in mid-December 2018. If it holds, this agreement has the potential to allow the ports of Hudaydah and Saleef to operate at near-normal capacity, allowing the free flow of food, fuel and commercial and humanitarian goods into Yemen and preventing further increases in food prices.555\n\nDespite substantial humanitarian food assistance (HFA), Yemen's food insecurity situation remained dire in 2018. As of December, some 15.9 million people - more than half (53 percent) of the total population - were in IPC Phase 3 or above, even when taking the mitigating effects of the current levels of food assistance into account.\n\nSpecifically, about 5 million people (17 percent of the population analysed) were in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and around 10.9 million people (36 percent) in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Of greatest concern were the 64 000 people in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) experiencing extreme food gaps and/or unable to meet basic food needs without full employment of coping strategies. This was actually the first time that the Yemen IPC Technical Working Group classified people in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5), thereby reflecting the very high severity of food insecurity for some population groups. A further 8.9 million were classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2).\n\nAn additional analysis was conducted by the Yemen IPC Technical Working Group to estimate the severity and magnitude of food insecurity excluding the mitigating effects of the HFA delivered. It found that about 20.1 million people or 67 percent of the total population would have been in need of urgent action to save lives and livelihoods at the end of 2018 had HFA not been delivered. In the hypothetical case of a complete absence of humanitarian assistance, a number of districts would have been classified as Famine Likely.556 At 238 000, the number in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) would WFP Yemen Market Watch, September 2018. 555 UN Department of Public Information, December 2018 556 Famine Likely means famine is likely happening but limited evidence 554 does not allow confirmation. y e m e n\n\nFP /J\n\nA TH\n\nD U\n\nM O\n\nN T have been nearly four times the actual number and at 10 million the number in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) would have been nearly double the actual number.\n\nFood insecurity was more severe in areas with active fighting, and particularly affected IDPs and host families, marginalized groups as well as landless wage labourers facing difficulties in accessing basic services and conducting livelihood activities.\n\nFACTORS DRIVING ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY557\n\nA stop-start battle for control of Yemen's Red Sea coast prevailed from the middle of 2018. By the end of October fighting reached the outer edges of the port city of Hudaydah, a gateway for the trade of food and medicine supplies and lifeline for two thirds of the country's population.558 The fighting compounded the hardships facing the highly vulnerable population of the city, home to 600 000 people, exacting a high civilian toll and destroying hospitals and health centres.\n\nUnless when stated otherwise, the main source in this section is the IPC brief issued in Dec. 2018. 558 International Crisis Group.

Some humanitarian programmes were scaled back and the staff overseeing them left.559 From mid-October to mid-November, WFP was unable to access 51 000 metric tonnes of wheat grain stored at the Red Sea Mills, enough to feed 3.5 million people for a month. Similarly, a key UNHCR warehouse where emergency shelter and non-food items were stored became inaccessible because of fighting.560\n\nLimited funding and access issues created huge gaps in humanitarian assistance in the areas most affected by the conflict. The IPC analysis attributed the sharp increase in the number of populations in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) to populations in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) not being targeted with Humanitarian Food Assistance. The analysis called for an urgent scale-up of humanitarian food and livelihood assistance and for access to be granted to all districts under active fighting, with special attention given to IDPs.\n\nAs of the last week of October, IOM recorded that more than 545 000 people had fled their homes since 1 June 2018, equating to almost 3 700 each day. Of this population, 83 percent came from Hodeidah governorate and 14 percent from Hajjah to the north of Hodeidah.561 The overwhelming majority (89 percent) of the country's two million IDPs562 had been displaced for more than a year, straining host communities that are struggling to cope with already-stretched limited resources.563 There were around a million returnees, and the country was also hosting 279 000 refugees, mainly from Somalia.564\n\nYemen is highly import-dependent for food, yet lack of foreign currencies as a result of the continued depreciation of the Yemen Riyal against the USD severely curtailed imports of essential commodities. High import taxes, double taxation of commodities, movement restrictions and insecurity disrupting market supplies, lack of credit for traders, and shortages and high prices of fuel increasing transport/storage costs OCHA.

Yemen update, 27 October-9 November 2018 564 UNHCR December 2018 559 all pushed up the cost of food, putting what limited food there was beyond the reach of many families. Between July and November, no wheat grain imports had been reported in the seaports of Al-Mukalla and Aden to supply Hadramout and the other neighbouring governorates.565 Governorates including Hodeidah and Sa'ada that experienced intensified conflict in 2018 continued to suffer the most from soaring prices of basic commodities.566\n\nIn October retail prices of food commodities were 70-180 percent higher than in the pre-crisis period and national average fuel prices 140-260 percent higher and expected to rise further. The average cost of the monthly minimum food basket was 140 percent higher than before the crisis.567 In December 2018, prices of the most important staples had increased significantly - between 12 and 43 percent - compared to their year-earlier levels.568\n\nLimited job opportunities and decreased wages as well as lack of payment of public salaries and pensions undermined people's ability to purchase (increasingly expensive) food and other essential goods: this lower demand weakened the ability of traders to buy supplies and keep commercial imports flowing, adversely affecting market availability in general. More than 80 percent of Yemenis live below the poverty line.569\n\nAccess to low quality water and in diminishing quantities at household level challenged food preparation as did the increasing cost and low availability of cooking fuel.\n\nAlthough only a small proportion of food is produced domestically - constrained by natural conditions and lack of inputs - increases in local production could help improve local market supplies and improve farmers' livelihoods. However, rainfall shortages, costly and unavailable farm inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, tools, veterinary services, and fuel for pumping irrigation water, have contributed to shortages of locally-produced food too. Fishing opportunities have been affected by either conflict, or climatic events such as cyclones and hurricanes.\n\nFAO & FSTS, Monthly Market Monitoring Bulletin, December 2018 566 WFP Yemen Market Watch September 2018 567 WFP Yemen Market Watch October 2018 568 FAO & FSTS.

Droughts and floods are recurrent natural hazards that have frequently inflicted damage on the agriculture sector. Poverty is endemic in rural areas, where livelihoods are not diversified and are mainly centred on agricultural activities.\n\nFrom October 2018-March 2019, 1.17 million people, representing 39 percent of the population analysed, were estimated to be in need of urgent action to save lives, protect livelihoods, reduce food consumption gaps and acute malnutrition. Of these around 839 000 people (12 percent) were classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and approximately 333 000 people (five percent) were classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). In addition, 2 million people were classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and at risk of slipping into Crisis without support to build their resilience.\n\nThe number of food-insecure in need of urgent action was higher than the post-harvest period (May-September 2018), when 825 500 people were classified in IPC Phase 3 or above. During this period, out of 58 districts analysed, just two (Mambwe and Lunga) were classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), and the remaining districts were in Minimal (IPC Phase 1) and Stressed (IPC Phase 2).

Prices of maize meal, wheat flour and rice climbed sharply from October 2018, mostly due to the drop in the local currency and shortage of foreign exchange that increased production and distribution costs.594 As of December 2018, food prices were more than 50 percent higher than year-earlier levels.595 These significantly elevated prices severely affected poorer households' ability to purchase food.

Areas in the north-western part of the country, particularly Kariba and Binga and north eastern parts of Rushinga, had higher numbers of people in need compared to other districts.591\n\nOverall, the food security situation in 2018 improved compared to 2017 when an estimated 4.1 million were acutely food insecure during the peak hunger period, chiefly as a result of the severe El Niño-induced drought of 2015/2016.592 However, the 2018 food insecurity trend deviated from a typical year when food insecurity usually peaks during the lean season in the first quarter. The number of food insecure people in October-December 2018 was higher than the 1.1 million in the January to March lean period.593\n\nWorld Bank 2018 Zimbabwe Overview 589 FAO Zimbabwe at a glance 590 ZimVac 2018, ZimVac 2018 SADC Dissemination, an unpublished 588\n\nPowerPoint presentation. 591 Ibid. 592 ZimVac, 2016 Rural Livelihoods Assessment 593 ZimVAC 2017\n\nFP /F\n\nIO N\n\nA G\n\nU Y\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9160\n\nReduced rains at the start of the cropping season and during the mid-season period caused a contraction in the area sown and lower yields.597 Production of the main food staple, maize, remained above the five-year average in 2018, although the harvest declined by 21 percent on a yearly basis and the overall aggregate cereal output was 24 percent lower.

There has been a drop in the proportion of rural households consuming an acceptable diet (from 63 percent in 2015 to 55 percent in 2017) and an increase in the share of households consuming a poor diet (from eight percent in 2015 to 16 percent in 2017).606 The minimum dietary diversity for women was 40 percent and even lower in Matabeleland South and North.607 According to 2018 data, just four percent of children are receiving a minimum acceptable diet.608\n\nWhile access to safe drinking water and sanitation is improving, defecating in the open is still prevalent at 30 percent among rural households.609\n\nZIMVAC. 2017 Rural Livelihoods Assessment Report 607 Ibid 608 Nutrition National Survey 2018 609 ZIMVAC. 2017 Rural Livelihoods Assessment Report 606\n\n2 0 1 9 f o o d i n s e c u r i t y a n d m a l n u t r i t i o n f o r e c a s t s\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9162\n\nFOOD INSECURITY AND MALNUTRITION FORECASTS 4. 2019\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 163\n\nMAIN DRIVERS OF ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY AND MALNUTRITION 2019\n\nConflict and insecurity are likely to remain the primary drivers of food security crises during 2019. Conflict is expected to persist in Afghanistan, Cameroon, Chad, Libya, Mali, Myanmar, the Niger, north Nigeria, Palestine, the Syrian Arab Republic, Ukraine (Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts) and Yemen. Local insecurity and intercommunal violence will continue to undermine food availability and access in Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Iraq, Kenya's Arid and Semi Arid Lands, Pakistan, Somalia, South Sudan and the Sudan.\n\nIn addition to causing direct loss of lives, conflict and insecurity will continue to have a direct impact on agricultural production and on the functioning of markets. Violence will continue to deprive households of their livelihood assets and accentuate their use of negative coping strategies, deepening their vulnerability to shocks. Conflict and insecurity will contribute to increasing displacement, internally or towards neighbouring countries, or will ensure people remain displaced for prolonged periods of time, aggravating, in most cases, the food insecurity status of those fleeing.\n\nLarge displacement created by conflict or insecurity also poses concerns for some of the countries hosting refugees and migrants. In particular, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey hosting Syrian refugees; Bangladesh, especially in the district of Cox's Bazar, hosting Rohingya from Myanmar; Uganda hosting refugees from both South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Cameroon and Burundi hosting refugees from the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo; countries affected by the Lake Chad crisis hosting populations displaced by Boko Haram-related insecurity; and Colombia, Ecuador and Peru hosting migrants from Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).\n\nWeather shocks are expected to have a severe impact on agricultural and livestock production in several regions of the world in 2019, and consequently on food security. In the southern Africa region, dry weather has already reduced prospects for the 2019 agricultural output,1 with expected negative repercussions for food availability and likely increases in prices in Angola, Lesotho, Southern Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe, central South Africa and northern Nambia.2\n\nIn mid-March tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall in Sofala province in Mozambique bringing devastatingly strong winds and heavy flooding. At the time of publication, according to the Emergency Response Coordination Centre, there were at least 200 fatalities and 600 000 people in Mozambique, over 125 000 in Malawi and nearly 10 000 in Zimbabwe affected,3 though these numbers were likely to increase. The tropical cyclone followed a week of heavy rains and flooding across south-east Africa that had already killed dozens of people in Malawi, Mozambique, and South Africa. Although the true scale of the damage was still not known at the time of publication - particularly as many areas were cut off - it was bound to further exacerbate the food insecurity in the region because of the massive destruction of livestock, livelihoods and planted crops just before the harvest season.\n\nIn East Africa, wet conditions and above-average rainfall are forecast in south-eastern Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia through April 2019,4 which may be beneficial for crops and pastureland, but will exacerbate the structural fragilities of pastoral and agro-pastoral communities if flooding occurs, destroying/damaging homes, infrastructure and livelihoods and washing away seeds and seedlings. In the Sudan the June to September 2019 rainy season is forecast to be above-average, which may lead to favourable crop yields but also to flooding and an increase in the prevalence of waterborne disease.5\n\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, dry weather associated with El Niño conditions are expected to have an impact on agricultural production and food prices in Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of). However, in Nicaragua the apante season bean crops, harvested in March, were generally favourable thanks to good rains and in Haiti, rainfall conditions were also favourable for crops except in drought-affected areas in Nord and Nord-Est.6\n\nIn the Central America Dry Corridor the drought during the primera harvest and the damages to postrera production due to excess rainfall will compel poor households in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to\n\nFAO GIEWS Crop Prospects and Food Situation, March 2019 2 FEWS NET Southern Africa Key Messages February 2019 3 EC-DG-Echo ERCC.

The estimates peak numbers for Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi and Zambia remained unchanged between 2018 and 2019 as the same analysis was used to assess the peak numbers of both years. The estimate for Somalia covering Feb-June 2019 was produced excluding the mitigating effects of humanitarian food assistance. For Burkina Faso and Mali, the trend reflects not only the peak to peak comparison, but also the increasing insecurity that affects food security in the country\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 165 be market-dependent well before the traditional lean season (March instead of May).7 These households have already exhausted their capacities to cope with weatherrelated shocks and many face income losses because of decreased international price of coffee.\n\nWhile expected above-average precipitations in large portions of Asia, including Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and northern Pakistan, are expected to be largely beneficial for crop production and pasture regeneration, they could also cause destructive flooding, while in Far East Asia, dry conditions were expected to occur in Papua New Guinea and the Philippines.\n\nIn addition, insufficient rainfalls in 2019 are expected to affect crop and livestock production in Djibouti, South Sudan, the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda. Extreme climate events are very likely to occur and affect food security in other countries already confronting food crises, such as Bangladesh (floods/landslides) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (drought and floods). Recurrent hazards are expected in Mauritania (dry spells), north Nigeria (floods) and Myanmar (floods).\n\nEconomic instability\n\nConflict, local insecurity, or political volatility can result in economic instability or severe growth slowdowns. These situations can manifest in reduced living standards, sharp currency depreciations and limitations in the capacity of governments to respond effectively to food crises. Some of the most pertinent consequences of economic instability include a reduction in a country's import capacity that can reduce national food supplies, and sharp increases in food prices that curb access to food. Higher fuel costs, often resulting from currency depreciations, can further push up food prices and lack of work opportunities weaken the ability of farmers and smallholders to invest in inputs needed to increase crop yields or to build their resilience to shocks.\n\nIn 2019, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Libya, South Sudan, the Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Yemen and Zimbabwe are expected to continue to be afflicted by economic instability, with acute repercussions for the food security of vulnerable households. The poorest households are normally the most affected by rising prices of food commodities, and other essential items, given the relatively high proportion of household expenditure allocated to food purchases. In addition, lack of employment in a weak economic environment erodes households' purchasing power, exacerbating food insecurity.\n\nFEWS NET 7\n\nDisease outbreaks\n\nIn emergencies, populations - particularly when displaced in overcrowded camps - are more susceptible to disease outbreaks and epidemics, which strained health systems cannot prevent or control.\n\nIn Yemen, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lake Chad Basin and Cameroon's Anglophone regions persistent or increased conflict is expected to further hinder access to health and nutrition services. Cholera outbreaks will persist in 2019 in many conflict and displacement- affected countries and to potentially rise in settings with poor sanitation infrastructure, contamination of drinking water and lack of health services. Following outbreaks in Yemen, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan, Madagascar, Ethiopia and Kenya in 2018, measles cases will persist particularly in areas experiencing or recovering from a natural disaster or conflict, where routine immunizations are interrupted, and overcrowding in residential camps greatly increases the risk of infection. Measles outbreaks can result in epidemics that cause many deaths, especially among young, malnourished children.\n\nACUTE FOOD INSECURITY FORECAST FOR 2019\n\nRegional forecast for Africa\n\nBelow-average October-December 2018 rains curb recovery in drought-affected East African countries\n\nIn Somalia, south-eastern Ethiopia and northern and eastern Kenya, exceptionally abundant April-June 2018 rains resulted in an above-average main season crop production and prompted a substantial regeneration of rangeland resources. This triggered a marked improvement in livestock body conditions and allowed animal conception and reproduction. However, the October-December 2018 rains were generally poor, resulting in reduced second season harvests and incomplete pasture regeneration. This curbed a full agricultural recovery from the severe drought-induced losses of 2017, especially in pastoral areas.\n\nIn Somalia, nearly 1.6 million people, mainly in central and northern pastoral areas, are expected to be in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) through June 2019, driven by below-average deyr October-December rains\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9166\n\nM ap\n\n5 9\n\nN um b er o f p eo p le in\n\n/C H\n\nP ha se 3 o r ab o ve (r an g es ) i n 2\n\n0 1\n\nSo ur ce : F\n\nSI N\n\nG R\n\nFC M ar ch\n\nE st im at e s fo o d in se cu re p o p u la ti o n e e d o f u rg e n t as si st an ce in\n\n2 0\n\n1 9\n\n(m ill io n s)\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 167 in tandem with destitution and displacement from the 2016/2017 drought and protracted conflict. While this is significantly lower than the 2.7 million estimated in February-May 2018, sustained humanitarian assistance will still be vital to reduce food consumption gaps and acute malnutrition, to save lives and protect livelihoods.\n\nIn Kenya, the lasting impacts of an above-average main season harvest in 2018, high livestock prices and milk production, will generally limit the deterioration in food security beyond Stressed (IPC Phase 2) levels between February and May 2019. Still, some northern pastoral areas (parts of Wajir, Garissa, Turkana, and Samburu counties) are likely to face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) levels of food insecurity following severe rainfall deficits during the second cropping season and/or intercommunal conflicts disrupting livelihoods and food access.\n\nIn bimodal rainfall areas covering most of Uganda, abundant carryover stocks from the above-average 2018 first season harvest and low cereal prices are expected to support Minimal (IPC Phase 1) food security outcomes through May 2019. By contrast, in the unimodal northeastern Karamoja region, as a result of sharply reduced 2018 crop production following poor seasonal rains, large segments of the population are likely to face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) food insecurity levels in the first half of 2019. The food security of refugees from South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo could deteriorate from Stressed (IPC Phase 2) to Crisis (IPC Phase 3) if adequate levels of humanitarian assistance are not provided. Risk of the Ebola virus disease spreading regionally from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where it is currently contained, is very high, given the displacement of Congolese refugees to Uganda.8 By 1 March 2019 no cases of Ebola had been reported in Uganda.\n\nIn Ethiopia, vulnerable pastoral households in the southern Somali region and northern areas of the Afar region, both affected by the rainfall deficits, are expected to face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) until May 2019. Crisis levels of food insecurity are also expected in areas of Oromia, SNNPR, Somali, and Benishangul Gumuz, affected by intercommunal clashes and displacement in 2018, and in parts of Eastern Oromia (East and West Hararghe), where livelihood losses from conflict-related displacement were compounded by localized crop production shortfalls following erratic June-September kiremt rains.\n\nWHO. EVD Democratic Republic of the Congo External Situation Report No. 24, 16 January 2019 8\n\nConflicts and economic crises will continue to aggravate food insecurity in parts of central and eastern Africa\n\nIn South Sudan a steady deterioration in food insecurity levels is forecast throughout the first half of the year driven by the cumulative effects of national and localized conflicts, continued mass displacement, and prolonged years of asset depletion. Only 52 percent of the 2019 national cereal needs have been met by harvests while the ongoing economic crisis will continue to inhibit households' purchasing power and push up food prices. The number of people facing Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) levels of acute food insecurity is set to rise from nearly 6.2 million (54 percent of the population) in January 2019 to 6.9 million (60 percent of the population) by May to July. An estimated 50 000 people are expected to be in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) by the middle of the year.9\n\nDespite the good 2018 cereal harvest in the Sudan, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) levels of food insecurity are expected to persist in the first half of the year in parts of Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile states, where the economic crisis is obstructing any potential security improvements, as well as in parts of North Kordofan, Red Seas and Kassala states. Food insecurity is expected to deteriorate during the June-September lean season in line with the worsening macroeconomic situation driving extremely high food and non-food prices and constraining food access for market-dependent households. In addition fuel shortages are likely to negatively affect agricultural production and livelihoods. Hard currency shortages will continue to hamper imports and humanitarian operations. Of highest concern are the IDPs in the Sudan People's Liberation Movement - North (SPLM-N) controlled areas of South Kordofan and the Sudan People's Liberation Army - Abdel Wahid (SPLA-AW) controlled areas of Jebel Marra, which are expected to be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) during the AugustSeptember peak of the lean season.  \n\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo food insecurity is expected to remain severe in conflict-affected eastern and southern regions in 2019. In late 2018, an improvement in the security situation in the Kasai region and in the Tanganyika province prompted some displaced households to return, but a resurgence of violence has been reported in other parts of the country, including Ituri, North and South Kivu provinces. The persistence of the Ebola virus disease in North Kivu and Ituri provinces will likely exacerbate the negative impact of conflict on livelihoods.

The final months of 2018 were defined by large-scale security incidents, with clashes between armed groups in Ouaka, Ouham, Haute-Kotto, Mbomou, and Nana-Grebizi prefectures and intercommunal conflict in Mbomou, Basse-Kotto, and Haut-Mbomou prefectures. Violence continued in early 2019, resulting in new displacements internally and to Cameroon and other neighbouring countries, and livelihood losses,10 although a peace agreement was reached in February between the government and armed groups bringing new hopes for reconciliation and lasting peace. Agricultural operations will continue to be severely affected by the widespread conflict, which will continue to cause input shortages and further deplete households' scant productive assets. The 2018 agricultural output was again well below the pre-conflict average, triggering an early start to the lean season.\n\nThe situation in Burundi remains complex. While security has improved since 2016, the underlying political crisis that erupted in 2015 remains unresolved, and the severe economic crisis that followed will persist in 2019, mainly in the form of foreign currency shortages constraining imports and public spending cuts aggravating high levels of chronic poverty. Administrative obstacles and insecurity are obstructing needs assessments and hindering humanitarian response, particularly in remote areas where needs are highest. Late and poorly distributed rainfall in October-December delayed the 2019 first harvest to January/February 2019, prolonging the lean season by 1-2 months and delaying planting of Season B, which accounts for about half of annual production. A second consecutive poor season would have grave consequences for food security in these areas. In Kirundo, Muyinga, and Bubanza provinces most poor households are expected to face Stressed (IPC Phase 2) levels of food insecurity through May 2019, with the worst-affected households likely to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3).\n\nFAO GIEWS Crop Prospects and Food Situation, March 2019 10\n\nPolitical crises, insecurity and displacement will restrict food access in parts of northern Africa\n\nFor more than 40 years the Sahrawi refugees have been living in extremely harsh and isolated conditions in the Sahara Desert in south-western Algeria. Hosted in five refugee camps, refugee families rely primarily on humanitarian assistance to secure their food needs as employment opportunities are limited.11 This situation is unlikely to improve in the coming year, while funding for the crisis is unpredictable.\n\nSince 2011 Libya has faced interlinked political, security and economic crises that are driving protracted conflict, increasing displacement, damaging its economy, weakening State institutions, and facilitating criminal gangs and the existence of armed militias. A major liquidity crisis is having a severe impact on vulnerable people who have limited access to cash. This, in tandem with low incomes, limited savings and spiralling food prices, is curtailing their access to food. The majority of households that are still engaged in agricultural production report challenges such as power cuts, increased insecurity and the inability to access or afford inputs, including animal fodder and veterinary services. An estimated 298 000 people need food assistance in 2019 including 94 000 migrants and 23 000 refugees, according to the 2019 Humanitarian Needs Overview.\n\nReduced seasonal rains diminish 2019 production prospects across areas of southern Africa\n\nIn most countries of southern Africa, the number of food insecure was projected to remain stable at the start of 2019, corresponding with the peak of the lean season. However, in Zimbabwe, owing to spikes in staple food prices since October 2018, food security worsened significantly between January and March 2019. The sharp price increases were instigated by severe fiscal challenges, primarily foreign currency deficits and a significant loss in the value of the Zimbabwean bond note on the parallel market that caused a steep hike in import costs. The price increases, notably for cereal products, reduced access to food, at a time when households are increasingly reliant on market supplies.\n\nHarvesting of the 2019 main season food crops from April is expected to foster transitory improvements in food security, except in Angola, Lesotho, Mozambique,\n\nWFP Food Security Assessment 2018 11\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9170\n\nNamibia and Zimbabwe where reduced seasonal rains between October 2018 and January 2019 are likely to result in below-average 2019 harvests, especially as most agricultural production is rainfed. Dry weather conditions have particularly affected Namibia, Lesotho and Zimbabwe, where sharp production contractions will tighten household supplies, and reduce incomes from crop sales.\n\nA further risk to subregional food security is a projected decline in cereal production in South Africa, the main exporter of grains for structurally cereal-deficit countries in the sub-region. Increased South African grain prices are expected to raise import costs for these countries. This, in turn, would exert additional upward pressure on domestic food prices in import-dependent countries. By contrast, in Madagascar and Malawi, weather conditions have been more favourable, boosting the food production outlook for 2019. At the national level, the number of food insecure is not expected to rise, but higher prices of staple foods and localized weather shocks are likely to prevent any significant improvements. In Zambia, the outlook is more mixed. In southern parts, crop conditions point to a second consecutive annual decline in food production, which would accentuate the impact of the poor harvest in 2018 and likely result in further stresses to food security, compounded by the higher year-on-year food prices. Elsewhere in the country, production prospects for the 2019 staple crops are more favourable, which should allow households to recover from the comparatively stressed conditions in 2018.\n\nFood security generally set to improve in West Africa and the Sahel except in conflict-affected areas\n\nIn northeastern Nigeria, large numbers of poor and/ or displaced households will remain heavily dependent on humanitarian assistance as severe insecurity continues to disrupt agricultural and marketing activities. About 4.5 million people are projected to face Crisis (CH Phase 3) food insecurity or worse during the lean season from June to August 2019.12 This projected number is 15 percent lower than the same period in 2018, when the estimate peaked at 5.3 million. Favourable weather and localized security improvements resulting in increased yields and plantings, and better market functionality, are likely to improve food availability and access, while sustained humanitarian interventions will continue to avert extreme food insecurity outcomes, saving lives and restoring livelihoods.\n\nMore than six years after the start of the conflict in northern Mali, intercommunal violence and clashes between armed groups continue to trigger displacements and disrupt the livelihoods of thousands of households, whose capacity to withstand shocks has been progressively eroded by consecutive droughts, floods, epidemics and chronic poverty. Above-average 2018 crop and livestock production thanks to favourable weather conditions, coupled with declining food prices and sustained humanitarian assistance, are expected to improve food security in 2019. According to the Cadre Harmonisé analysis, during the June-August 2019 lean season, about 416 000 people are forecast to face Crisis or worse (CH Phase 3 or above), less than half that of the corresponding period in 2018. However, the highly volatile security context will ensure that protection, food, health and education needs remain substantial.\n\nInsecurity in Mali is also affecting northern Burkina Faso, which is hosting refugees from Mali as well as IDPs. Attacks from armed groups formed in Mali increased in frequency and intensity in the third quarter of 2018, spreading from the regions bordering Mali to others closer to the capital and toward the east of the country. There are now concerns that these groups could further destabilize the country, leading to waves of displacement in 2019. During the lean season in June-August 2019, 676 000 people are expected to be in Crisis (CH Phase 3) or Emergency (CH Phase 4), about 32 percent less than in the corresponding period in 2018, mainly due to the above-average 2018 cereal output. However, food security is not expected to improve in the northern Sahel region (Oudalan and Soum provinces), where Crisis (CH Phase 3) levels will prevail because of severe insecurity disrupting livelihoods and markets.\n\nSimilarly, in Chad, the 2019 lean season numbers of acutely food-insecure people are expected to be substantially lower than in 2018. In June-August 2019, about 519 000 people are forecast to face Crisis (CH Phase 3) food insecurity or worse, about 40 percent less than in the corresponding period in 2018, mainly thanks to an increased 2018 crop production. However, food security is not expected to improve in the Lac region where Crisis (CH Phase 3) levels will prevail, driven by the persisting spillover effects of the conflict in northeastern Nigeria. Furthermore, food insecurity is expected to deteriorate in the Tibesti region from Stressed (CH Phase 2) to Crisis (CH Phase 3), because of the disruption of livelihoods following the outbreak of conflict around gold-bearing areas since October 2018.\n\nBoth Senegal and Liberia are expected to have fewer food-insecure people during the 2019 lean season than during that of 2018 mainly because of the better 2018 cropping season, while numbers are expected to remain steady in Mauritania.\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 171\n\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)\n\nThe \"Intergovernmental Authority on Development\" (IGAD) is an organization currently comprising seven countries in eastern Africa, namely Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, the Sudan, and Uganda. IGAD's mission is to assist and complement the efforts of the member states to achieve their multiple development efforts, especially in the areas of food security, environmental protection, peace and security, and economic cooperation and integration in the region.\n\nSince the drought catastrophe in 2011, IGAD coordinates a regional approach (IGAD Drought Disaster Resilience and Sustainability Initiative or IDDRSI) to strengthen drought resilience in eastern Africa. The IDDRSI proposes operational and institutional implementation arrangements to end drought emergencies. The strategy recognises the need for a comprehensive and holistic approach to combating chronic food and nutrition insecurity and addresses the poverty and environmental degradation to build the resilience of communities and households to the effects of droughts and other shocks in the region.\n\nFor more information on IGAD: https://igad.int/\n\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC)\n\nThe Southern African Development Community (SADC) is an inter-governmental organization comprising 16 southern Africa countries, namely Angola, Botswana, Comoros, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, the United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

Violent conflict and instability in neighbouring countries along with tensions within the Niger continue to result in population displacements, particularly in the Diffa, Tillabery and Tahoua regions. The effects of the state of emergency in these areas will continue to hinder the movement of people and goods, and access to markets as well as to farming fields and grazing areas, resulting in price increases, the disruption of livelihoods, and rising levels of food insecurity and malnutrition. Land degradation, pest attacks, floods and forage deficits due to drought in agricultural and pastoral areas have also had negative impacts on food insecurity in the country and put pressure on already limited natural resources, resulting in reduced production outcomes.\n\nIn Cameroon, food security is set to improve in 2019 in the Far North region thanks to improved security and favourable weather conditions increasing crop production. By contrast, it will deteriorate in Anglophone North West and South West regions, where clashes between armed secessionists and security forces are disrupting agricultural and market activities. As of late February 2019 around 440 000 people were internally displaced in South West, North West and Littoral and West regions.14\n\nUNHCR buea weekly operational update, 18-22 February 2019 14\n\nREGIONAL FORECAST FOR ASIA\n\nDrought in East and Central Asia will affect the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\n\nIn the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, poor rains and abnormal high temperatures between mid-July and mid-August, followed by heavy rains and floods in late August and early September, have caused significant crop damage, resulting in a below-average 2018 main season harvest. In addition, the 2018/19 secondary season output, including wheat, barley and potatoes, is estimated at a below-average level, due to erratic precipitations (rains and snow) during the winter months. Reflecting the tight domestic supplies, the already precarious food security situation, with most households having borderline or poor food consumption rates, is expected to further deteriorate in 2019.\n\nHigh levels of acute food insecurity are expected to persist in parts of South and South-east Asia\n\nFood insecurity in Afghanistan is expected to remain severe, although conditions are not foreseen to deteriorate significantly. This outlook mostly reflects a projected increase in wheat production following beneficial rainfall recorded in late 2018 that facilitated planting, and sufficient snowfall boosting water availability for irrigation of spring crops. High temperatures, forecast for March-April, could accelerate snow-melt run-off and contribute to flooding in basins that already have high snow-water volumes. An estimated 80 percent of the soil is already in poor condition and subject to erosion following years of dryness.15\n\nConflict will continue to limit economic growth, livelihood opportunities and incomes, which will force many households, particularly the poorest, to engage in negative coping strategies, rendering them even more vulnerable to ongoing climate and conflict-related shocks.\n\nIn Myanmar, violence and discrimination against the Rohingya is likely to persist in 2019, with the most affected populations located in the states of Rakhine, Kachin and Shan. The persisting insecurity is anticipated to impede the full delivery of humanitarian aid. Market disruptions and movement restrictions are expected to persist in 2019, limiting the Rohingya people's ability\n\nFEWS NET Afghanistan Seasonal Monitor February 2019 15\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9174 to engage in income-generating activities needed to strengthen food security. Moreover, the fragile security situation continues to impair production prospects for 2019 food crops in the aforementioned states.\n\nWith little prospect of repatriating Rohingya refugees back to Myanmar, the large-scale humanitarian operation targeting Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh's Cox Bazar district will continue to stabilize the acute situation in the vast and overcrowded camps, where nearly the entire refugee population, estimated at 911 000 Rohingya as of January 2019, receive food assistance. The influx of refugees is likely to continue to strain the already-limited resources of the host communities. The monsoon and cyclone season risk damaging dwellings and livelihoods. Further population displacement is expected as the government identified a potential location (Bhashan Char) for over 100 000 Rohingya refugees to ease the pressure on overcrowded settlements in Cox's Bazar.16\n\nIn Pakistan, below-average irrigation water supplies, coupled with reduced precipitations between October and December 2018 especially in Sindh and Balochistan provinces, raised concerns for the performance of the rabi wheat crop, to be harvested in April and May 2019.\n\nProtracted conflicts to prolong severe humanitarian crises in large areas of Western Asia/Middle East\n\nAfter the end of military operations against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in late 2017, the humanitarian context in Iraq has transitioned into a postconflict phase, with an estimated more than 4 million IDPs returning to their areas of origin in late 2018. However, a volatile security situation and unpredictable dynamics throughout the country still affect livelihoods and humanitarian assistance. Attacks by armed groups continue to be carried out along with small-scale military operations, resulting in new displacements and affecting the IDP return rate. In addition, new sources of instability are emerging linked to rising poverty rates, delays in community reconciliation, lack of livelihood opportunities, and political and social tensions, which cause small-scale new displacement.\n\nIn Yemen, the humanitarian situation is expected to deteriorate further in 2019, especially in western Al Hodeidah, Amram, Hajjah, Taizz and Sa'ada governorates, which are among the areas worst-affected by the conflict. Four years of protracted conflict have left the country's critical economic and civil infrastructure in ruins, displaced millions of people, led to massive loss\n\nJRP for Rohingya Humanitarian Crisis, February 2019 16 of income and livelihoods, sharply increased prices of basic foods and pushed the economy towards collapse. In January prices of imported staples (wheat flour, wheat grains, non-basmati rice, sugar) were above their year-earlier levels, and the quantity of commercial food imports reportedly reached its lowest since July 2016. Significant disparities in food and fuel prices between urban and rural areas exist, depending on the security situation, the proximity to main ports, the state of supply routes as well as the integration with other market networks such as humanitarian assistance programmes.17\n\nIn Palestine, the conflict with Israel continues to generate severe humanitarian needs among the Palestinian populations of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem. In 2018 the highest escalation of violence since the 2014 war resulted in increased shelter, protection, health, and livelihoods needs, as well as disruptions to humanitarian access on an intermittent and often unpredictable basis. In the Gaza Strip, the increased violence and the continuous degradation of the economic environment, with soaring unemployment rates, has the potential to intensify the already alarming levels of food insecurity.\n\nMarch 2019 marked the eighth anniversary of the beginning of the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic. The humanitarian situation remains dire and has been exacerbated by harsh winter conditions, including torrential rains. The security situation considerably improved in 2018, but with only the governorates in the north-east and north-west remaining outside government control, the war could enter its final and possibly most violent stages, with dismal humanitarian consequences. In addition, wheat production hit its lowest levels in 30 years in 2018, as a result of drought and conflict, and this will negatively affect food security in 2019. The ongoing conflict and lack of agricultural inputs will likely limit production in 2019.18\n\nSyrian refugees in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey face depleting resources and falling donor funding\n\nA robust response to the Syrian crisis provided by governments and the international community has provided a crucial safety net for Syrian refugees in camp and out of camp in neighbouring countries to meet their basic food and nutrition needs. However, a number of risks face them in 2019 including potential tension with host communities, particularly over employment opportunities, weakening domestic economies, decreasing donor funding and government attention shifting away from the emergency refugee response.\n\nFAO and FSTS Monthly Market Monitoring Bulletin, January 2019 18 GIEWS Crop Prospects and Food Situation No. 1 March 2019 17\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 175\n\nGiven the protracted nature of the crisis, refugees' limited resources are continuing to erode, leaving their situation increasingly insecure. In February 2019 5.7 million Syrian refugees were registered, chiefly in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt, and many without seeking refugee registration according to UNHCR.19 Continued commitment and well-targeted programming are essential to keep the situation from deteriorating.\n\nRegional forecast for Europe\n\nProtracted conflict in Eastern Ukraine will undermine food access, especially for the elderly\n\nThe civil conflict, which began in spring 2014 in the eastern part of the country, has become increasingly protracted. Unemployment, reduced income and high inflation rates severely limit the food access for about 1.1 million people with the elderly, individuals living alone and women-headed households particularly vulnerable, especially during the cold winter months, when higher heating expenses force families to make cuts in areas such as medication, schooling or food. The humanitarian community in Ukraine is striving to establish a platform of activities that seek better collaboration across institutional boundaries, advocating efforts on issues that cannot be solved by either humanitarian or development partners but require political action.\n\nRegional forecast for the Pacific Islands\n\nClimate shocks and structural fragilities threaten food security of Pacific Island inhabitants\n\nThe Pacific Islands region is highly vulnerable to droughts, floods and cyclones, particularly during an El Niño year. Rising sea levels and cyclones destroy already-limited agricultural land, and increase salt intrusion, reducing productivity of land. Traditionally the region has relied on diets consisting of readily available indigenous foods, such as root crops, fish and vegetables. But rapid urban population growth is happening at the expense of rural communities, where agricultural output is falling, while reliance on imported foods with lower nutritional value (e.g. processed meats) is rising. Consequently, households are vulnerable to international price volatility, particularly in urban areas.\n\nUNHCR Syria 19\n\nThese factors, combined with high poverty, limited sources of cash income and low awareness about nutritional requirements will influence hunger risk. Around 3.5 million people (approximately one third of the region's population) live under their countries' national poverty lines and are unable to meet their basic needs. Resilence-building measures are urgently required.\n\nRegional forecast for Latin America and the Caribbean\n\nDry weather conditions and high food prices bleaken food security outlook in the CADC\n\nThe Central American Dry Corridor (CADC) is one of the most susceptible regions in the world to climate change and variability with Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua the most prone to drought and long periods of heatwaves during El Niño years, as well as to extreme precipitation. The frequency and intensity of droughts and floods has been increasing in recent years.\n\nCENTRAL AMERICAN INTEGRATION SYSTEM\n\nThe Central American Integration System (Sistema de la Integración Centroamericana, or SICA) is the institutional framework of regional integration in Central America, composed of the states of Belize, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama.\n\nThe Program of Information Systems for Resilience in Food and Nutrition Security of the SICA region (PROGRESAN-SICA) aims to increase the sustainability of livelihoods and increase countries' adaptation capacities to climate change. It seeks to generate relevant, timely, valid and reliable information as a basis for the development of effective public strategies and policies. It focuses on building people's resilience to shocks with the ultimate aim of defeating poverty, hunger, and malnutrition.\n\nMore information at: http://www.sica.int/index_en.aspx\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9176\n\nMap 62 Number of people in Phase 3 and above (ranges), drivers and risks in Latin America and the Caribbean in 2019\n\nForecast drivers of acute food insecurity in 2019\n\nVENEZUELAN MIGRANTS, COLOMBIA\n\nEL SALVADOR\n\nGUATEMALA\n\nHONDURAS\n\nNICARAGUA\n\nVENEZUELA\n\nVENEZUELAN MIGRANTS, ECUADOR\n\nVENEZUELAN MIGRANTS, PERU\n\nG L O B A L R E P O R T O N F O O D C R I S E S 2 0 1 9 177\n\nThe outlook for 2019 is even worse than that of 2018 when the El Niño phenomenon prompted extremely dry conditions and an extended heatwave. Around 2 million people are expected to be in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) in 2019. More than half of these people live in the Guatemalan Dry Corridor and the remainder in El Salvador and Honduras.\n\nThe prolonged 2018 heat wave, which caused very high maize and bean losses, will compel poor households to continue to buy food when in a normal year basic grains would be available from their own harvest. As a consequence the annual lean season began in January instead of March/April. While markets will remain supplied, lowering grain prices, low international coffee prices are likely to depress wages and cause an income shortfall, limiting food consumption to basic products, such as maize and beans. The poorest households have already exhausted their capacity to employ survival strategies, such as taking loans, selling breeding animals, using seed stocks, and cutting spending on health, education and agricultural inputs, to ensure access to a basic minimum of food. In addition, political instability in Nicaragua presents a further risk to food insecurity, with potential negative impacts on markets and retail prices.\n\nFood insecurity and emigration are likely to remain high or increase in Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)\n\nIn Venezuela, the humanitarian and food security situation is likely to remain very severe over the coming quarters, as hyperinflation and local currency devaluation continue to critically erode households' purchasing power and access to food. A collapse of real salaries and in the value of the local Bolivar currency, shortages of food, medicine and basic supplies, and the deterioration of health-education and infrastructure are heavily affecting people's lives.\n\nIn January 2019, the National Assembly President Juan Guaidó declared himself interim leader and has been recognised by several countries. Demonstrations and protests have escalated across Venezuela, and external pressure has mounted to back the self-declared interim president, while other countries back the current government. At this stage, it remains unclear how the political impasse will be resolved.\n\nLarge numbers of Venezuelans will continue to leave the country. Venezuelan refugees and migrants worldwide were estimated at 3.4 million in January 2019, with 80 percent of them hosted in Latin America and the Caribbean (1.1 million in Colombia, 506 000 in Peru, and 288 000 in Chile). At the end of 2018, UNHCR and IOM estimated that an additional two million people might leave the country over the upcoming 14 months.20 Humanitarian needs to assist refugees and migrants in host countries are expected to remain significant in 2019.\n\nInhabitants of Caribbean islands continue to face frequent and intense natural disasters\n\nAccording to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) the eastern Caribbean islands are the second most hazard-prone in the world (after the Asia-Pacific region). Inhabitants face tropical storms and hurricanes from early June to the end of November (particularly in the small island states of Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Dominica, Grenada, Antigua and Barbuda as well as Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Haiti) and floods, with regular annual losses from disasters estimated at 3 billion USD per year. In its 2018 Caribbean Outlook report, ECLAC recommended that governments in the region improve resilience by undertaking recovery and reconstruction assessments.\n\nFood insecurity is projected to intensify in Haiti following below-average harvest output in 2018 chiefly because of dry weather conditions. Inadequate harvests in tandem with increased demand and the impact of local currency depreciation on inflation ensured the prices of maize and locally produced and imported rice, the primary food staple, were higher than year-earlier levels at the start of 2019. Dry conditions and elevated inflation are likely to continue through May: 2.6 million people are expected to face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) during the lean season between March and June.21\n\nThe persistence in Haiti of the socio-political crisis, inflation and the depreciation of the local currency against the USD will also contribute to low purchasing power. Public discontent poses a further risk to food security in 2019: violent demonstrations in the capital and other cities have severely cut access to basic services and goods. However, the increase in rice production mainly thanks to an expansion in the planted area and the government's efforts to increase yields through rehabilitation of irrigation and other agricultural infrastructure, will avert a more severe deterioration in food insecurity.\n\nUNHCR Venezuela RMRP 2019 21 IPC December 2019;

For example, elevated malnutrition due to disease outbreak or lack of health access - if it is determined to not be related to food consumption deficits - should not be used as evidence for an IPC classification. Similarly, excess mortality rates due to murder or conflict - if they are not related to food consumption deficits - should not be used as evidence for a Phase classification. For acute malnutrition, the IPC thresholds are based on percentage of children under 5 years that are below 2 standard deviations of weight for height or presence of oedema.

Yet, they have well distinguished objectives and rely on different data and methodologies. The most important differences between the two global reports are presented below.\n\nThe Global Report on Food Crises The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World\n\nMain objective Informs on the severity, magnitude and drivers of acute Informs on the progress towards ending hunger, achieving food insecurity and malnutrition in food crisis situations food security and improving nutrition (Sustainable Development across the world.

The GAM by MUAC cut-offs are based on CDC analysis of survey data (unpublished) that best correlate with the WHZ thresholds. Further analyses are also currently underway to determine the need for regional thresholds and potential use of convergence of evidence for classification of severity of acute malnutrition. The application of these thresholds will be evaluated through IPC for Acute Malnutrition Lessons Learning Process in 2016/17. IPC for Acute Malnutrition done by MUAC will have a lower confidence level, which will be indicated by hash lines on the IPC maps.\n\n2) GAM by WHZ may come from representative surveys or sentinel sites and GAM by MUAC may come from representative surveys, sentinel sites, or screening (either exhaustive or sample screening). See box 2 below for details on reliability score, preference ranking as well as minimum criteria to be considered when conducting IPC for Acute Malnutrition.\n\n3) GAM by WHZ is preferred over GAM by MUAC. If GAM by WHZ and GAM by MUAC are both available, GAM by WHZ should be used in the classification. If information is available on multiple indicators preference ranking should be used to determine the final Phase.\n\nDiagram 1: IPC for Acute Malnutrition Refere ce Table\n\nUSAGE: Classification of areas based on the prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) measured either by Weight for Height Z-score and/or oedema (WHZ) or Mid-Upper Arm Circumference and/or oedema (MUAC).
