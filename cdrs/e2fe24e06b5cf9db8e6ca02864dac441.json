Due to poor rainfall since November western Namibia is in a severe drought. Conditions may worsen as limited rain is forecast next week.\n\n2. In southwestern Madagascar, an uneven and inadequate rainfall distribution since the start of the rainfall season has resulted in severe drought. Drought conditions are likely to persist.\n\n3. Insufficient rain since January has resulted in large moisture deficits and below-average vegetation conditions over portions of northwestern Angola.\n\n4. Below-average rain over the past four weeks has led to large moisture deficits and poor ground conditions over portions of the Nampula province of northern Mozambique.\n\n5. Poorly-distributed rain since late February has resulted in abnormal dryness across central and northeastern Ethiopia. Scattered light rain in the region next week may not be sufficient to overcome deficits.\n\n1 2\n\n1 4\n\nWeather Hazards Summary\n\nAfrica Overview\n\nLittle relief to dryness in Ethiopia Seasonal rainfall continued throughout the Greater Horn. Lighter rainfall totals were also recorded across many parts of Uganda and western Kenya following heavy, flood inducing rains earlier in March. However, locally moderate to heavy rainfall was observed over the Tana River and Garissa provinces in the southeast. In Somalia, light to locally moderate rainfall was received over the Jubba and Shabelle River basins according to satellite rainfall estimates (Figure 1).\n\nOver the last several weeks, heavy and frequent rainfall has led to above-average moisture conditions in the south and erratic and poorly distributed rains have resulted in anomalous dryness in the north (Figure 2). Since early March, the largest moisture deficits remain concentrated in the northern Oromia, eastern Amhara, eastern Tigray, and the Shinile zone of Ethiopia, with many local areas have experienced less than half of their normal rainfall accumulation for the month of March.\n\nFurther south, significantly high moisture surpluses (100- 200mm) have encompassed much of Kenya and northern Tanzania due to torrential rainfall amounts that fell several weeks ago. Risks remain for localized flash floods in Kenya.\n\nNext week, rain is forecast throughout southern and eastern Ethiopia, with some areas expecting more than 50mm.\n\nRain provides some relief to southern Africa Rain was recorded in southwestern Africa last week, which has helped alleviate seasonal dryness over parts of Angola and Namibia. Torrential rainfall was registered over central Mozambique, where some local areas recorded over 150mm during the last week.\n\nNext week, heavy rainfall is expected to continue over southern and central Angola with the potential for locally heavy rainfall amounts in northwestern Namibia. While this could help to reduce short-term deficits, drought-like conditions are expected to for the remainder of the season towards the south. Elsewhere in southern Africa, generally seasonable rainfall is forecast.\n\nSource: NOAA/CPC\n\nNote: The hazards outlook map on page 1 is based on current weather/climate information and short and medium range weather forecasts (up to 1 week).

Lighter rainf ll accumulations were also received across many p rts of Ug nda a d western Kenya following heavy, flood inducing rains earlier in March. However, locally moderate to heavy rainfall was observed over the Tana River and Garissa provinces in the southeast. In Somalia, light to locally moderate rainfall was received over the Jubba and Shabelle River basins according to satellite rainfall estimates (Figure 1).\n\nOver the last several weeks, a north-south or ented dipole anomaly pattern has developed throughout Ethiopia, as heavy and frequent rainfall has led to above-average moisture conditions in the south, and erratic and poorly distributed rains have resulted in anomalous dryness in the north (Figure 2). Since early March, the largest moisture deficits remain concentrated in the northern Oromia, eastern Amhara, eastern Tigray, and the Shinile zone of Ethiopia, with many local areas have experienced less t an half of their normal rainfall accumulation for the month of March. The continuation of suppressed precipitation in April is likely to adversely impact ground conditions and cropping activities, as there is not much opportunity for moisture recovery before rains begin their cessation in May over the region.\n\nFurther south, significantly high moisture surpluses (100-200mm) have encompassed much f Kenya and n rthern Tanzania due to torrential rainfall amounts that f ll several we ks ago. Although rains have gradually decreased during the last dekad in March, saturated ground conditions are likely to sustain the risk for localized flash floods and river basin inundation over Kenya.\n\nFor the upcoming outlook period, a significant increase in the quantity and distribution of seasonal rainfall is forecast over Ethiopia according to the latest model dat . Widespread weekly accumulat ons in excess of 50mm are expected throughout southern and eastern Ethiopia, with higher amounts also expected across northern and southern Somalia during early April.\n\nHigh late-season rains provide ome relief to anomalous dryness ov r s uthern Africa.\n\nFor the s ond consecutive week, enhanced rainfall amounts were registered over much of southwestern Africa, which has helped to mitigate seasonal dryness over parts of southern Angola and northern Namibia. Torrential and possibly flood inducing rainfall amounts were also registered over central Mozambique, where some local areas recorded over 150mm during the last week.\n\nDuring the next week, heavy rainfall is expected to continue over southern and central Angola with the potential for locally heavy rainfall amounts in northwestern Namibia. While this could help to reduce short-term deficits, drought-like conditions are expected to for the remainder of the season towards the south. Elsewhere in southern Africa, generally seasonable rainfall is forecast.\n\nSatellite Estimated Total Rainfall (mm) Valid: March 28 - April 3, 2018\n\nFigure 1: NOAA/CPC\n\nSatellite Estimated Rainfall Anomaly (mm) Valid: March 5 - April 3, 2018\n\nFigure 2: NOAA/CPC\n\nSeasonal rainfall continued throughout the Greater Horn, with increased precipitation amounts over the western regions of Ethiopia, and decreased amounts over the southern region compared to the previous couple of weeks.

Maximum temperatures were as high as 42°C in southern Turkmenistan, while maximum temperatures reached the middle 30s°C across northwest Afghanistan. Above-normal temperatures are forecast to persist through early April. An abnormal heat hazard is posted for areas where maximum temperatures average more than 8°C above normal.\n\nPrecipitation Widespread precipitation (2-43mm, liquid equivalent) was observed across Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and western Tajikistan during the final week of March. According to gauge data, precipitation during March generally averaged 25-75% of normal across much of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and bordering areas of Afghanistan. Drought hazards are posted for much of Afghanistan and portions of adjacent countries.\n\nNext week, precipitation is forecast for Afghanistan and surrounding areas. The highest amounts (more than 25mm, liquid equivalent) are forecast to occur across the highest elevations of northeast Afghanistan and Tajikistan. This precipitation may provide limited drought relief.\n\nNo hazards reported\n\nCentral America and the Caribbean Overview\n\nConditions seasonal in Central America Last week, scattered rain fell in Guatemala and El Salvador (10-50mm). Besides some localized rain in Costa Rica, many other parts of the region remained dry. Despite the lack of rainfall during mid-March, several regions in Central America continue to register near-normal conditions towards the end of the Apante season. Vegetation is healthy.\n\nNext week, rainfall is forecast in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, with daily totals of 25mm and even 50+mm possible. Many other parts of the region may experience light rains as well.\n\nScattered rain showers recorded Hispaniola received light rain showers last week. Eastern Dominican Republic received 10mm to more than 25mm of rainfall. Rains were generally on the lighter elsewhere, which is normal for the season. Since late-February, rainfall continues to range between average and above-average. Generally favorable ground conditions are observed across Hispaniola. Rain is forecast next week, possibly more than 50mm.\n\nABOUT WEATHER HAZARDS Hazard maps are based on current weather/climate information, short and medium range weather forecasts (up to 1 week) and their potential impact on crop and pasture conditions.

During the final days of March, moderate rains were scattered about Guatemala and El Salvador. According to satellite estimates, 10-50mm were observed in local areas. Besides some localized rain in Costa Rica, many other parts of the region remained dry. Despite the lack of rainfall during mid-March, several regions in Central America continue to register near-normal conditions towards the end of the Apante season. Analysis of seasonal moisture anomalies since last December suggest the performance of the Apante season has been generally favorable, with many regions experiencing average to above-average rainfall conditions due to periods of enhanced rainfall during January and early February. Remotely sensed vegetation health indices also indicate satisfactory ground conditions, with little evidence of degradation despite the seasonably dry conditions during February and March. The forecast for the outlook period is for enhanced rainfall in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. While the spatial pattern of rains looks characteristic for the beginning of the Primera rainfall season, the GFS model indicates total amounts are likely to be greater than normal. 7-day totals of more than 25 and even 50+mm are favored in Guatemala and Honduras. Many other parts of the region may experience light rains as well.\n\nWeek 1 Rainfall Total Forecast and CMORPH climatology (mm) April 5 - April 11, 2018\n\nFigure 1: Source NOAA /
