Since July, the number of priority hotspots has increased by 15 percent - largely owing to slow livelihoods recovery and emergence of new drought in southern and southeastern pastoral areas.\n\n FAO requires USD 12.5 million to address needs of pastoralists affected by new drought in southern and southeastern Ethiopia. The failure of a critical rainfall season across the Horn of Africa has caused critical shortages of pasture and water, resulting in extreme emaciation, disease outbreaks and the deaths of tens of thousands of livestock in affected areas of Ethiopia.\n\nMAP\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nEl Niño-induced drought in 2015 caused humanitarian needs to soar in 2016; the failure of two consecutive rainfall seasons devastated the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and pastoralists, with crop failure between 50 and 90 percent, hundreds of thousands of livestock dead owing to pasture and water shortages and very limited alternatives for income generation. At the start of 2016, more than 10.2 million people were in need of emergency food aid, 1.7 million households seed insecure and 2.4 million households in need of livestock support. By August, food insecurity decreased only slightly, to 9.7 million people. The belg season harvest was slightly below average in 2016, but nearly double the previous year's belg cereal output of a mere 760 000 tonnes. Meher season production is expected to be 20 percent higher than last year - an achievement that can partly be attributed to the largest emergency seed distribution in Ethiopia's history, led by FAO and other humanitarian actors in 2016. Despite humanitarian needs having nearly halved since last year, food insecurity - especially in areas worst-affected by the drought - remains high, with 5.6 million Ethiopians requiring food aid in 2017. From July to December, the total number of hotspot woredas increased by 15 percent - Priority 1 hotspot areas decreased only slightly, 217 woredas remained the same despite increasing national food availability and the status of 120 woredas has worsened - mainly in southern and southeastern pastoral areas where new drought is emerging. Alarmingly, 86 woredas have remained in Priority 1 since December 2015. In northern and eastern highland areas where crop production was poor and in newly drought-affected areas of Oromia, SNNP and Somali Regions, households are likely to continue facing high levels of food insecurity well into 2017.\n\nHOTSPOT CLASSIFICATION (Source: Government of Ethiopia and humanitarian partners, December 2016)\n\nHotspot woreda classification has been derived using six multisector indicators, including agriculture and nutrition, agreed at zonal, regional and federal levels. A hotspot matrix is often used as a proxy for the Integrated Phase Food Security Classification (IPC).\n\nCHALLENGES FACING FOOD AND AGRICULTURE\n\nThe failure of the October-December rains - one of two main rainfall seasons in southern and southeastern Ethiopia, accounting for 35 percent of annual rainfall - has resulted in significant pasture and water deficits, severely affecting livestock-dependent households in Oromia, SNNP and Somali Regions. Influenced by the strongest negative Indian Ocean Dipole in 50 years, the drought is regional in scale and affecting neighbouring livestock-holding communities in Kenya and Somalia. A large influx of livestock from those areas to Oromia and Somali Regions has already been observed. Abnormal migrations, high livestock mortality rates, outbreaks of opportunistic diseases and extreme emaciation have been reported - thousands of livestock are unable to stand without assistance. Demands remain high for water trucking and pasture across affected communities, and hundreds of thousands of livestock require survival and supplementary feed. Since October, household terms of trade have fallen, disfavouring livestock sellers who have had to increasingly sell their animals to afford basic commodities, exposing them to greater food and nutrition insecurity. Impacts will continue to be felt until the spring rains, expected in March or early April. In Gambella Region, increasing pressure on limited resources is straining the food security of refugees and their host communities. More than 322 000 South Sudanese refugees now live in the region, where livelihood options are extremely limited. In 2017, enabling households to produce their own food will be a humanitarian priority.\n\nFAO PRIORITIES, RESPONSE AND FUNDING\n\nACTIONS TAKEN IN 2016 PRIORITY ACTIVITIES IN 2017\n\n Provided crop and vegetable seed in the most nutritionally vulnerable districts, benefiting 168 000 households.\n\n Distributed survival and supplementary livestock feed to more than 10 000 households.\n\n Improving access to water for livestock through the rehabilitation of 18 water points, benefiting 125 480 livestock owned by 12 783 households.\n\n Supported fodder production through the provision of forage seed to 1 600 households.\n\n Destocked 4 381 livestock, enhancing the income of 3 214 livestock sellers and improving the nutritional intake of 4 354 displaced households.\n\n Treated and/or vaccinated nearly 1.4 million animals belonging to 77 118 households.\n\n Created and leads two emergency working groups (focusing on seed crops and livestock) to harmonize response to the crisis with Government, NGOs and resource partners.\n\n Established a Strategic Advisory Group with partners to provide technical advice to the chairs of the Disaster Risk Management Agriculture Task Force.\n\n- Supplementary feed for core breeding stock - Vaccination and treatment interventions - Capacity building of community-based animal health workers\n\n- Support fodder production and conservation - Rehabilitation of water points - Support animal destocking (commercial and slaughter)\n\n- Agricultural inputs for the belg and meher seasons - Pest and disease surveillance and control - Promotion of climate-smart and conservation agriculture techniques\n\n- Small-scale irrigation and water harvesting - Community and school gardens\n\n- Alternative livelihood support - Animal health interventions - Backyard gardens - Energy-saving interventions\n\n- Support to national- and regional-level coordination - Food security, livelihood, seed, crop and livestock assessments\n\nFUNDING SEED SYSTEMS SECURITY ASSESSMENT In 2016, FAO Ethiopia's El Niño drought response plan called for USD 50 million to reach 1.8 million people - despite FAO's appeal being just 28 percent funded, FAO succeeded in reaching 1.3 million drought-affected people last year. The main donors to FAO's response were Belgium, the European Union, FAO, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, OCHA, Spain, UNICEF and the United States of America.\n\nIn 2017, FAO is appealing for USD 20 million to assist 1 million households.\n\nPreliminary findings of the Seed Systems Security Assessment indicate that about 8 in 10 households will have enough seed to plant their fields in 2017. It was also determined that the majority of farming households would have sufficient access to quality and preferred types of seed and planting materials. This is extremely positive given mass seed insecurity in 2016 as a result of the drought, likely partly a result of the largest humanitarian seed distribution in the country's history. The assessment also found that seed sources were largely diverse, with about two-thirds of belg seed and three-fourths of meher seed sourced from the informal market. Local traders further speculated a reduction in prices, which will increase seed accessibility for vulnerable households.\n\nCONTACT Amadou Allahoury | FAO Representative | Addis Ababa, Ethiopia |
