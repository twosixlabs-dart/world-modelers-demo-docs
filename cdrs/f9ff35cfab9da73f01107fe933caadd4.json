This was evidenced by floods in December 2014 and January 2015 that affected over 100,000 people, damaged homes and critical infrastructure and were linked to outbreaks of cholera. While the region boasts an incredible diversity of ecosystems, natural resources, economic activities and cultures, it is also characterized by rapid population growth, urbanization of coastal areas, encroachment into ecologically marginal areas and poverty. The primary source of income for the region's rural population remains agriculture, much of it rainfed and allocated to cereal production. The region's uneven distribution of resources and changing climate dynamics pose significant challenges as well as considerable opportunities for cooperation across the countries of Southern Africa. Regional cooperation is coordinated mainly through the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and includes transboundary water management, disaster risk reduction and preparedness and market and trade negotiations. As central priority for its member states, climate change adaptation is featured in a number of key SADC initiatives.\n\nMay 2016 This document was produced for review by the United States Agency for International Development.

It is influenced by topography and large-scale seasonal atmospheric patterns, such as sea surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean (through the Agulhas current bringing additional moisture to the east coast) and the South Atlantic Ocean (through the Benguela current). Rainfall is driven mainly by the migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The majority of the region's rainfall comes during the summer months (November-March) with the exception of South Africa. Temperatures vary significantly, with the highest temperatures recorded in the Kalahari Desert (>40°C) and coastal regions of Mozambique. The lowest temperatures are found in the Lesotho, South Africa and Zimbabwe highlands. Rainfall is highly variable across the region, with a clear east-to-west gradient ranging from very dry conditions along the western Namibian coast to much higher rainfall in the coast of Mozambique. This dynamic is highly variable from wet to dry years. Longer-term variability is closely associated with the El Niño Southern Oscillation phenomenon, with El Niño events linked to warmer and drier conditions and La Niña events linked to cooler and wetter conditions.\n\nHISTORICAL CLIMATE\n\nKey changes in climate observed across the region since the 1960s:\n\n Increased mean, maximum and minimum temperatures, with more rapid increases in minimum temperatures (1-1.5°C on average), especially in the interior regions (1.6-2°C on average).\n\n Reduced late summer precipitation (November-March) in Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Zambia.\n\n Increased summer rainfall in Lesotho, Namibia and South Africa, and increased variability in Angola.\n\n Changes in the onset, duration, and intensity of rainfall, including increased frequency of dry spells (breaks in the rainy season of at least five days where no significant rain is received).\n\n Increase in number of warm days/nights and subsequent decreases in cold days/nights.\n\nFUTURE CLIMATE Projected Changes in Climate\n\nTemperature\n\n Mean temperature rise will exceed 2°C (or more), particularly in arid regions, with projected warming between 3.4°C and 4.2°C above 1981- 2000 averages and more pronounced increases in the summer (November-March)  Minimum temperature rise will exceed rise in maximum temperatures  Increased extremes in temperatures and heat waves\n\nRainfall\n\n Slightly drier conditions (including potentially increased intensity and duration of dry spells) on average, particularly April to September  Increased frequency of intense rainfall events  Increased frequency of droughts and dry spells\n\nShown under several emissions scenarios (changing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere) starting from the best case on the left to the worst case on the right. Darker shades are indicative of higher temperatures.\n\nSource: IPCC (2014).\n\nSECTOR IMPACTS AND VULNERABILITIES\n\nAGRICULTURE\n\nAgriculture in Southern Africa is predominantly rainfed (with the exception of wheat-producing areas in South Africa), which makes the region inherently vulnerable to climate variability and change. Grain prices and market dependency are regional, with some countries (e.g., Botswana and Lesotho) relying on imports to meet national demand for maize and sorghum, derived mainly from South Africa, while other normally selfsufficient countries (Mozambique and Malawi) have in recent years relied on imports to meet demands due to losses resulting from recurring floods and droughts. Cereal production, availability and access are key food security issues in Southern Africa. Over 40 percent of the region's land area is allocated to cereals, with maize the predominant crop, followed by millet (Namibia), paddy rice, sorghum (Mozambique) and wheat (South Africa). Climate is only one of many factors that influence the sector's vulnerability, which is already severely limited by poor infrastructure, stagnating farm incomes, reduced support to agricultural extension services, lagging technological innovation and research, poor farming practices and an increase in pests and diseases. Regionally, climate impacts on the sector will be largely detrimental, placing greater emphasis on intra-regional markets and trade to meet food security demands. (6, 8)\n\nWATER RESOURCES Changes in water quality and availability will be the dominant changes seen under a new climate. For example, stream flows for the Limpopo and Okavango catchments are projected to decrease by 35 percent and 20 percent, respectively. A more variable rainfall dynamic will also likely increase disasters associated with droughts, floods and waterborne diseases. As such, transboundary water management presents a unique opportunity and challenge to the region. Southern Africa's water resources cut across a number of transboundary river basins and are unevenly distributed, both seasonally and geographically. A majority of the region has supply deficits during at least part of the year, presenting a limiting factor for development. Rising demands and increasing levels of pollution across shared water resources are a critical problem. Droughts and floods are normal events in the region's climate context, as are a number of natural cycles of climate variability that cause flood pulsing (variability between low and high flows). Infrastructural developments intended to safeguard water supplies have increased the geographical unbalance of water resources, as many dams have been built to store water during the unpredictable and often long dry periods, particularly in South Africa and Zimbabwe. The region's water resources are marked with contrasts, with significant and untapped hydropower potential in countries such as Mozambique and no potential to expand water storage capacity in others (South Africa). Inadequate extent and maintenance of existing water infrastructure, unclear mandates for shared watercourse institutions and limited institutional capacity all hamper transboundary water management. (1, 2, 8, 11, 13, 14)\n\nClimate Risks and Potential Impacts AGRICULTURE\n\nClimate Risk Potential Impact\n\nIncreased evapotranspiration Reduced soil moisture Increased heat stress on crops Decreased water availability\n\nCrop failure and reduced yields\n\nMore conducive environment for pests and pathogens\n\nChanges in areas suitable for agriculture and/or specific crops\n\nChanges in the length of the growing season\n\nChanges in access to food\n\nIncreased price volatility of food imports and increased food costs\n\nClimate Risks and Potential Impacts WATER RESOURCES\n\nIncreased temperatures More variable rainfall (increased intensity, changing seasonality and duration) Rising sea levels\n\nIncreased variability of river flows, decreased stream flows\n\nIncreased evaporation and reduced runoffIncreased frequency and occurrence of floods, droughts\n\nCompromised irrigation potential and expansion plans\n\nIncreased evaporation rates of existing water storage facilities\n\nReduced freshwater resources due to rising sea levels and salinization of coastal aquifers\n\nHUMAN HEALTH\n\nChanging temperature and precipitation patterns are likely to exacerbate multiple negative health outcomes, reversing the progress made in the region over the last 10 years. Indicators of human well-being related to health for the region show improvement, but are still relatively poor compared to other regions in Africa. The region faces a heavy disease burden largely due to poor waste management practices, inadequate drinking water and sanitation, limited access to health care facilities, scarce financial resources (less than 15 percent of GDP in the region is spent on health services) and poor governance. This in turn affects multiple health outcomes including malnutrition, diarrheal disease, malaria and other vector-borne diseases. Changing climate patterns including increasing temperatures and increased intensity, frequency and duration of extreme events pose an additional threat to these challenges, through changes in agricultural productivity and water availability, and increased distributions of disease-carrying vectors. Recent estimates suggest that implementing adaptation measures in the health sector could reduce the number of children at risk from chronic under-nutrition by 10 million in Sub-Saharan Africa, through improved disaster risk reduction measures that reduce vulnerability to extreme events such as flooding and droughts. A particular challenge from a climate perspective for the sector is the scant data available on the links between climate variables and disease patterns, which makes it difficult to design appropriate intervention and surveillance methods. Nevertheless, the most effective measures to reduce vulnerability to climate in the health sector in the near term are (a) promoting programs that implement and improve basic health system measures, such as the provision of safe water and improved sanitation, (b) securing essential health care, (c) increasing capacity for disaster preparedness and response, and (d) alleviating poverty. (4, 8)\n\nECOSYSTEMS\n\nUnder a changing climate future, impacts are expected to be substantial, negatively affecting important economic sectors such as fisheries, forestry and others. Southern Africa has unique and diverse terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems, including forests (the miombo woodlands, the mopane woodlands, the baikiea woodlands, acacia woodlands, montane and tropical moist forests and mangrove forests), which cover 41 percent of the total land area of the 15 SADC countries. These ecosystems provide a multitude of services to rural communities including employment, shelter, food, energy, construction materials for use, and other products. They also regulate core ecological processes on which people and livelihoods depend, including soil maintenance, water filtration, groundwater recharge rates and stream and river flows. Nevertheless, they face a number of pressures from human activities, including deforestation and degradation, due to increased demand for agricultural land, energy and urbanization. Deforestation in the SADC region is a major concern, with net forest loss from 2005-2010 recorded at 1.8 million hectares annually. Emerging evidence suggests that these ecosystems have already experienced shifting species ranges and reduced services. (5, 7)\n\nClimate Risks and Potential Impacts HUMAN HEALTH\n\nIncreased frequency, intensity and duration of extreme events Reduced water quality and quantity due to changing rainfall patterns\n\nFatalities due to extreme events\n\nReduced health status of vulnerable populations\n\nIncreased incidence of malnutrition\n\nSpread/altered distribution of vector- and waterborne diseases\n\nIncreased urban migration in search of basic services\n\nClimate Risks and Potential Impacts ECOSYSTEMS\n\nClimate Risk Potential Impact Droughts and prolonged dry periods Increased frequency of extreme events Increased temperatures + increase in very hot days >35°C Increased soil erosion, land degradation and deforestation Changes in species composition and phenology Reduced \"regulating\" services such as soil water maintenance, base flows and filtration Increased frequency of pests in commercial plantation forests\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\nDamage to infrastructure results from rising sea levels, high intensity rainfall events and extreme heat, all of which are projected to increase for the region. Increased losses from these events have the potential to undermine economic development goals. Studies on the potential costs of not implementing climate change adaptation measures in the Zambezi basin, for example, suggest cumulative damages as large as US$45 billion to existing infrastructure. Regional transport, communications and energy infrastructure are insufficient and unreliable, and clearly limit the region's potential for cooperation. Although investments in the sector are growing through SADC initiatives and donor support, they remain a regional challenge due to costly and unpredictable transport and logistics (especially for landlocked states); limited access to information and communications; inadequate information on meteorology and climate to guide planning and management of existing water resources; and a high number of people without access to potable water, adequate sanitation facilities and water for irrigation. A more variable climate clearly impacts this fragility by damaging limited infrastructure resources. (13)\n\nENERGY Energy and water are closely linked in Southern Africa. Water drives the turbines of hydroelectric power plants; coal processing and cooling in thermal and nuclear power plants require water; and energy is required to lift, treat and distribute water. This places climate at the forefront of the region's energy sector: projected changes to the water sector, such as a more variable and changing climate, will have a negative impact that could pose large potential revenue losses for some hydropower-exporting countries and increase costs to consumers in countries reliant on energy imports. Access to and production of energy is a critical limiting factor to meeting development objectives in Southern Africa and energy is a resource that, among others, remains unequally distributed. Only 25 percent of the region's residents have access to electricity overall, and only 5 percent in rural areas have access. Energy directly impacts individual livelihoods, communities and countries in terms of economic growth, employment, health, security and education. Energy storage lags behind most other regions in Africa, as does generation due to limited infrastructure, regulatory frameworks and financing in the sector. Nevertheless, cooperative agreements (including basin management plans and inter-basin transfers through regional coordination mechanisms) and an integrated view of available energy resources could offer a buffer against climate risks at the regional scale. For example, several electricity companies, organized under the SADC Southern African Power Pool (SAPP), are working to improve the common regional power grid by redistributing abundant resources in some countries to those with limited supplies, with the ultimate goal of increasing access to electricity across the region. (2, 8, 13)\n\nClimate Risks and Potential Impacts INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nIncreased heat stress and reduced water availability from rainfall Rising sea levels and increased storm surges Changing evaporation rates in water bodies Infrastructure damage Reduced power production, power outages Reduced potential irrigation capacity Reduced efficiency of existing flood protection mechanisms\n\nClimate Risks and Potential Impacts ENERGY\n\nReduced runoff and surface water availability Increased evaporation rates of existing water storage facilities Increased temperatures Increased variability of river flows\n\nReduced hydropower generation potential\n\nIncreased production costs, increasing prices for consumers\n\nChanging seasonal demands for energy with increased demand for peak loads during hotter summers; projected increased net electricity use\n\nRevenue loss from overbuilt and undersupplied hydropower\n\nDISASTERS USAID lists climate extremes as a major factor affecting resilience in Southern Africa. The region is vulnerable to a wide range of natural disasters including floods, droughts and cyclones. Vulnerability to the impacts of these events is a function of complex social, political and environmental factors likely to be exacerbated by current and projected changes in climate. For example, a decline in economic opportunities in rural areas has increased urban migration, leading to the establishment of informal settlements in areas at significant risk of flooding. Other key challenges include outdated or lack of risk assessments in critical areas, poor governance and institutional frameworks for disaster risk management, and lack of financial resources. Under SADC, a regional Disaster Risk Reduction Unit was established to help promote and coordinate preparedness and response programs for trans-boundary disasters. Additionally, the SADC Climate Services Center provides operational regional services and training for monitoring and predicting extremes in climate conditions for member states through the use of meteorological and hydro-meteorological products. (12, 13)\n\nPOLICY CONTEXT\n\nINSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK\n\nAlongside the discrete actions of national governments, SADC coordinates policy discussions at the regional level, including consideration of a range of climate change initiatives.\n\n Directorate of Infrastructure and Services houses the Climate Services Center. The center is currently setting up a processing center that will consist of a climate data management, processing, and production system for climate data, extreme weather monitoring and an integrated early warning system. The Water Division under this Directorate is responsible for coordinating implementation of regional waterrelated activities.\n\n Directorate of Food, Agriculture and Natural\n\nResources, along with the Directorate of Policy Planning and Resource Mobilization, supports institutionalization of international agreements on climate change, as well as facilitates the Climate Change Inter-sectoral Technical Working Group that supports regional climate policy development.\n\n In 2011, SADC established the Disaster Risk Reduction Unit.\n\nREGIONAL STRATEGIES AND POLICIES\n\n The SADC Policy Paper on Climate Change\n\n(2011) highlights the current and projected impacts of climate change on the region and suggests possible adaptation options.\n\n The SADC Climate Change Adaptation Strategy\n\n(2011) recognizes that water issues will impact a range of sectors, including energy, health and agriculture. Adaptation measures identified are water governance and management and infrastructure development.\n\n The Disaster Risk Reduction Strategic Plan\n\n(2006-10) sets out the strategic direction to achieve the long-term goal of building resilience of SADC nations and their communities.\n\n A Regional Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan is under development and was in the final validation stage as of June 2015. (12)\n\n The Framework of Sub-Regional Climate\n\nPrograms (2010), developed under the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN), maps programs and actors working on climate change adaptation in Southern Africa and identifies gaps or focus areas that are not being addressed in terms of adaptation.\n\nClimate Risks and Potential Impacts DISASTERS\n\nCyclical shocks including floods and droughts, sometimes in a single year Increased intensity of shocks, e.g., extreme rainfall or prolonged dry periods/droughts Increased frequency/intensity of tropical cyclones and heavy rains Erosion of adaptive capacity/ increased fragility of communities Increased food insecurity Increased livestock and human disease outbreaks Rising food and fuel prices, deeper poverty and reduced household resilience Increased instability and social tensions Increased waterborne diseases (cholera, diarrheal disease) Displacement and asset loss\n\nSome climate change research priorities for the region include:\n\n Building research capacity and strengthening platforms for research innovations.\n\n Contextualizing information at more localized scales.\n\n Understanding better what would engender the transformations to move societies to a resilient and low-carbon development pathway.\n\nSECTOR-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED PLANS\n\nA number of existing strategies support the adaptive capacity of the SADC region on climate variability and extremes, yet were not specifically developed for climate change adaptation. The most prominent and pertinent for climate change is the SADC Shared Watercourses Protocol (2003), complemented by the Regional Water Policy (2005). (10) The objective of the Protocol is to \"foster closer cooperation for judicious, sustainable and coordinated management, protection and utilization of shared watercourses and advance the SADC agenda of regional integration and poverty reduction.\" (3) Additionally, protocols on energy (1998), fisheries (2003), forestry (2009) and health (2004) are particularly relevant in the context of climate change negotiations and response initiatives. The Protocol on Energy, for example, provides that one of the objectives in the region is to cooperate in the adaptation and transfer of low-cost energy technologies. (9)\n\nNATIONAL STRATEGIES AND PLANS\n\nIn addition to regional strategies, several member countries have identified other priorities in national strategies and plans. Every country has submitted at least one National Communication to the UNFCCC. Most have submitted National Adaptation Plans and all either have or are developing a national climate change strategy (see table below). Countries also have climate change integrated into sectoral strategies. For example, in Malawi climate change adaptation is covered in the Food Security Policy, the National Agricultural Policy, the Agriculture Sector-Wide Approach, the Water Policy and the Disaster Risk Management Policy.\n\nREFERENCES 1.
