The Partnership was created during the Petersburg Dialogue Ministerial Conference in May 2010. It is co-chaired by the United States, Spain, and Costa Rica, and includes the participation of more than 50 developed and developing countries.\n\nThe Partnership is designed to deliver through three main elements: (1) a rapid review of adaptation action in Asia and the Pacific, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean; (2) regional workshops to facilitate participatory action planning and knowledge-sharing; (3) the strengthening of Communities of Practice (CoP) to support implementation and learning. The Effective Adaptation Policy and Programming in Crisis, Conflict and Transition Contexts workshops are undertaken with the partnership and support of the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nFor more information please visit www.adaptationpartnership.org change adaptation (CCA) and peacebuilding in Africa. The primary goal of the workshop was to provide an opportunity for leading African scholars and practitioners to engage with 30-40 U.S.-based experts from multiple levels of the climate change, adaptation, humanitarian, and peacebuilding communities in order to identify and debate both challenges and opportunities presented by climate change adaptation. This wide-ranging group worked together over the course of two days to better understand one another's priorities, objectives, and needs, and began identifying ways to work collaboratively around climate change adaptation and peacebuilding efforts. The workshop objectives were:\n\n1) To identify synergies between climate change adaptation and peacebuilding communities that can be harnessed to assist governments, communities, NGOs, and international organizations in making progress in both areas.\n\n2) To provide opportunities to share lessons learned from integrated efforts in the field, initial efforts to develop tools and guiding principles for capturing co-benefits through cooperation, and fostering dialogue and collaboration among a diverse group of policy stakeholders.\n\n3) To establish preliminary concrete steps to support effective climate change adaptation efforts in fragile and conflictaffected countries, turning awareness into action.\n\nIn order to achieve these objectives, the workshop was comprised of plenary discussions, small group exercises and a role play simulation that was developed specifically for this meeting. Day One provided an overview of the current academic research and practitioner perspectives on potential linkages between and implications of climate change, security, and peacebuilding. Day Two focused on operationalizing information gathered throughout the previous day in order to begin to build CoPs and offer suggestions on specific activities and next steps that could be pursued to advance efforts of\n\nClimate change and security have been linked in multiple ways, although some sets of linkages have garnered more attention than others. This workshop focused on three areas of linkage that have dominated discussions of climate and security links in developing country contexts. This list is not meant to be exhaustive but facilitates a focus on what topics would benefit from more sustained research and policy attention.\n\nMuch attention has been focused on the possible roles climate change may have on contributing to conflict and instability. These conflict links may come from direct or indirect impacts of climate change or from policy responses to those impacts. Africa has been a primary geographical focus for this academic, policy, and media attention. This topic remains hotly debated within these diverse communities throughout Africa and the international community. Many of these debates have included climate/environment, humanitarian development, conflict/ security, and peacebuilding communities, but rarely with all of these communities in active dialogue or collaboration.\n\nA second area of focus, drawing less attention, has been the impact climate change will have on conflict-affected countries. In these settings, states and societies are already challenged by the legacies of past, ongoing, or anticipated conflict. Climate change is anticipated as an additional stressor on economic, political, and social structures, making it more difficult for countries to successfully address the burdens of a history of conflict.\n\nMuch less scholarly and policy attention has focused on yet a third area: the peace and security threats and opportunities presented by efforts to adapt to climate change. How can adaptation efforts address climate change and peacebuilding challenges in conflict affected areas? Are there climate change adaptation and peacebuilding synergies that can be harnessed to assist governments, communities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and international organizations make progress in both arenas? How can the respective climate, development, and peacebuilding communities come together to pursue separate goals with common or collaborative steps?\n\nOn Thursday, November 1 and Friday November 2, 2012, USAID and the U.S. Department of State, in partnership with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Institute for Security Studies (Africa Program, Project on Leadership and Building State Capacity and the Environmental Change and Security Program), and IRG/Engility, convened a select group of experts, practitioners, and policymakers from both the United States and Africa in Washington, DC for a conference focused on the third area of concern - climate\n\nWorkshop Overview\n\nOUTCOMES AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThere were a number of observations, outcomes, and recommendations that emerged by the end of the workshop. For a full list, as well as specific recommendations for the followon workshop, scheduled to take place in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in 2013, please see the end of this report. Here is a snapshot:\n\n1) Several overlapping concepts, terms, challenges, and opportunities exist in the fields of climate change and peacebuilding. Participants recognized that the topic of \"climate change adaptation and conflict\" implied multiple distinct and related concepts and areas of inquiry:\n\n2) Participants identified the need for significant new case study work and collaboration across humanitarian, development, climate, and peacebuilding communities to engage in policy innovation in the field and analysis of effectiveness.\n\n3) There was strong interest among participants to build a new Community of Practice that would focus on sub-Saharan Africa and connect with other initial efforts focusing on Africa and other parts of the world. Members suggested utilizing online communications network to enable follow-on collaboration among workshop participants and providing resources for other interested parties. In order for such an effort to be successful, partnerships of different stakeholders would need to contribute to the discussion and development of Communities of Practice.\n\n4) Participants were enthusiastic about a potential climate change and peacebuilding toolkit modeled after the USAID Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) series or as part of that series. It would provide practical steps for integrating conflict analysis models and climate change adaptation.\n\nThese specific deliverables could be pursued in a two-step process of building out a network and engaging policy/donor/ government/community officials through existing institutions, such as the African Union. The ClimDev-Africa meetings are another opportunity. Participants saw value in continued efforts to raise awareness for policy audiences, using examples and case studies. a. Climate change exacerbating existing conflict dynamics b. Climate change leading to new conflict dynamics c. Conflict reducing communities' resilience to climate change d. Climate change and conflict interacting to deepen complex emergencies and crisis e. Activities related to climate change adaptation being leveraged to help build peace f. Activities related to peacebuilding being used to improve the outcomes of climate change adaptation efforts g. Activities related to other development areas being adapted to be more climate- and conflictresilient.\n\nKevin Urama, Executive Director of the African Technology Policy Studies Network\n\nDuring the two-day workshop a number of issues were raised on the impact of climate change in Africa, with special emphasis placed on the Horn region. At times, there were intense discussions about whether evidence even existed to support the claim that climate change has an impact on conflict or if it could be proven, with some participants strongly suggesting there was such research and others questioning the causational or correlational direction of that research. It was also pointed out that there is a tendency to think about Africa in terms of one singular, homogenous place. One participant poignantly stated,\n\nThis discourse led participants to recognize that the challenge of formulating national, regional, or even continent-wide policy towards climate change, adaptation, and peacebuilding in order to support sustainable and resilient societies was daunting. If the researchers and scientists themselves cannot reach agreement on whether climate change is a causal factor of conflict, how could they expect policymakers to take them seriously? Several participants voiced their frustration at how the information they collect is packaged and presented, and found it difficult to make concrete policy suggestions due to the speculative and relative nature of the information contained within. \"It is not very helpful to keep telling society 'we don't know,'\" someone said. They called for a new public relations strategy to support the language, methods, and information or evidence utilized by this new CoP that began to take shape over the course of the workshop.\n\nDAY ONE: CLIMATE ADAPTATION, DEVELOPMENT, AND SECURITY\n\nThe first day of the workshop was focused on developing a baseline understanding of the various concepts, terminology, and linkages among and between the fields of climate change adaptation, environmental security, peacebuilding, and humanitarian assistance. After introductory remarks by Steve McDonald, Director Africa Program, and the Project on Leadership and Building State Capacity, H.E. Olesegun Akinsanya, Regional Director, Institute for Security Studies, Addis Abeba and John Furlow, Climate Change Specialist,\n\nUSAID, participants shared experiences and expertise on both the causal connections between climate change and conflict, as well as the implications of climate change in fragile and conflict-affected areas.\n\nTERMINOLOGY SOUP\n\nThe first content exercise of the day, facilitated by Steve McDonald, was called Terminology Soup, which had the objective of identifying and presenting various terminologies in participants' respective fields in order to develop a comprehensive working knowledge of vocabulary. The participants were separated into four small groups based on their professional background and allotted approximately 30 minutes to develop a list of key phrases or terms with definitions that their cadre of experts utilizes on a daily basis. The groups reconvened to the plenary to present their findings. While there was some expected variation, the overlap of terms that emerged was enlightening. Terms such as mitigation, resilience, vulnerability, and sustainability were noted in all four groups, albeit with some differentiation in definition. For example, the term mitigation in the context of climate change typically refers to efforts to reduce the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, whereas \"conflict mitigation\" generally refers to efforts to mitigate the causes and drivers of armed conflict, or occasionally its effects. The exercise resulted in serving an additional purpose to that of its original intention, which was to underscore the similarities and cross-cutting themes amongst the various fields that could contribute towards harnessing potential collaboration and building a new CoP.\n\nSummary of Proceedings \"Africa is a large continent. It is a story full of stories. Something can be true somewhere and not in other places.\"\n\nGeoffDabelko, Professor and Director of Environmental Studies in the George V. Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Affairs at Ohio University, and Beakal Bisrat, Institute for Security Studies, Addis Ababa\n\nCAUSAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE AND CONFLICT The first roundtable discussion was led by Drs. GeoffDabelko, Professor and Director of Environmental Studies in the George V. Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Affairs at Ohio University and Lulsegged Abebe, Senior Advisor to the African Union for International Alert. The purpose of this session was to establish what is currently understood in academic literature about linkages between climate change and conflict. Questions that were posed to the discussion leaders were: 1) How do climate change and conflict interact? 2) Does one cause or ameliorate the other? 3) What are the security implications of these linkages? and 4) What is the evidence for this?\n\nDr. Dabelko provided an overall synopsis of current understanding of climate change and environmental security, highlighting that the two are often misunderstood and sometimes disregarded as spurious. He highlighted the fact that the fields are not making the type of impact that is necessary, in part because of the lack of succinct methodology used to collect and analyze the data on the linkages and potential causal factors of climate change on conflict. He noted that climate change does not need to take precedent over other important issues, such as poverty or sustainable livelihoods, when determining underlying factors of conflict, but that it \"needs to be seen in the mix.\" Dr. Dabelko concluded by stating the objective of this workshop is finding ways to move from a deductive argument to the overlap of how we can address these issues together.\n\nThis provided a smooth transition into Dr. Abebe's remarks, which were more focused on his current research in Mali, Niger, and Nigeria with regard to a common riverbed that runs through the three countries. He looked at how climate change has affected the different members of society, such as fishermen, pastoralists, and farmers, and how climate change and environmental stresses influence human security. His findings suggested that climate change, in combination with other environmental changes, can create certain dynamics within a society that contribute to conflict. Dr. Abebe called for flexible policies that are inclusive of adaptation mechanisms and geared towards resolving or mitigating conflict.\n\nDIALOGUE AND DISCUSSION\n\nWhile there was wide agreement that a link (or links) exist between climate change and conflict during open discussion, there was great debate amongst participants about whether climate change was a direct cause or an exacerbating factor on conflict. The consensus settled on the latter, as participants recognized that the \"causes\" of conflict are complex and multi-faceted, involving political, social, environmental, and economic dimensions. Climate change, rather, acts as a threat multiplier, potentially exacerbating social tensions or instability in states that are already fragile and conflict-prone, or intensifying ongoing conflicts. Participants highlighted the need for richer discussions about the stressors and drivers of conflict, and suggested that reframing the question from \"Does climate change cause conflict?\" to \"How is climate change consequential to conflict?\" or \"Can I understand a particular conflict without looking at climate change?\" might be a way of facilitating more fruitful inquiry and action.\n\nOne example that illustrates how climate variability or change has the potential to act as an exacerbating factor was with regard to pastoralist and agriculturalist communities throughout sub-Saharan Africa. With its high reliance on rain-fed agriculture for basic food security and characterized by highly spatial and temporal rainfall distribution, subSaharan Africa is experiencing the negative effects of climate change as it is repeatedly exposed to droughts and floods that extend over longer time periods than in the past. Water scarcity, food insecurity, climate-related migration, and poverty are constant threats to its populations, making it a high risk region for potential conflict. One of the unintended consequences of these pressures is the changing migration patterns of pastoralists. As drought tightens its grip on the\n\n\"What climate change does is it changes the game and we can't use yesterday's problem for today's issue that is going to be tomorrow's solution.\"\n\n- Lulsegged Abebe, Senior Advisor to the African Union for International Alert\n\nAlfred Omenya, Associate Professor of Architecture and Head of School of the Built Environment at the University of Nairobi region, killing pastoralists' cattle and intensifying pressure over scarce resources, such as water and grass land, pastoralists are forced to settle in areas that consist of predominantly agricultural communities. This has heightened tensions between the two populations, which, if not prevented, could end up in open conflict.\n\nClimate change is also consequential to conflict in that conflict could impact the ability of countries and communities to adapt to climate change. For example, parts of Somalia are experiencing severe droughts, which lead to negative agricultural output and forced migration in order to survive. Somalia has also experienced decades of political and violent conflict that has led to the deterioration of the state. Without addressing and resolving the non-climate-related drivers of the conflict within the country, the chance for long-term progress on adaptation can be undercut.\n\nPolicy responses to climate change, such as land management policies, could also contribute to the risk of conflict. For example, countries may shift from using land for food production to energy production, and there is a risk of land being taken away from the hands of local communities to that of larger global corporations. For those livelihoods that depend on the land, policies that exclude their participation and equitable distribution of the resources could lead to potential conflict.\n\nProviding hard evidence to support policy suggestions is a constant challenge that needs to be addressed if climate change adaptation is going to influence policymakers in regular and productive ways. Some participants expressed a desire to repackage and restructure knowledge on climate change and its linkages with conflict in order to have larger, more substantial impact with greater legitimacy. Opportunities exist to bring communities together for a common overarching goal in order to address potential future conflicts, such as water scarcity in the Nile River Basin.\n\nIMPLICATIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN FRAGILE AND CONFLICT-AFFECTED AREAS The second roundtable discussion was led by Dr. Kevin Urama, Executive Director of the African Technology Policy Studies Network, and Nisha Krishnan, Doctoral Candidate at the University of Texas. The objective of this session was to consider how climate change may contribute as an additional stressor in fragile, crisis- or conflictaffected areas. How will the effects of climate change impact these environments? What are some of the hypotheses or outcomes of current research indicating for this area of study? What steps, if any, are being taken to foresee this impact? Is climate change adaptation a factor or consideration when formulating policy in post-conflict situations?\n\nDr. Urama focused his remarks on how to address vulnerability to climate change in fragile or conflict-affected societies. He argued that if a society lacks the ability to provide basic services to its population, and/or poorly manages its natural resources, then that society will be prone to weak governance and increased potential for conflict. He called for the development of conflict-sensitive adaptation methods in order to manage these factors (or reduce potential stressors), and suggests looking at a number of indicators when doing so - vulnerability, poverty, governance, migration, geopolitical location, and availability of natural resources. Even though conflict is a human decision and climate change may be but one trigger for conflict, vulnerability to climate change will increase the more triggers exist within a society. He proposed several ways to address vulnerability through climate change adaptation, but three main ideas/themes emerged:\n\nProviding an example of one tool available to help distinguish and assess vulnerability levels within fragile or conflict-prone areas, Ms. Krishnan discussed her work on mapping with the Climate Change and Political Stability in Africa (CCAPS) project. CCAPS collects and analyzes how climate change, conflict, governance, and aid intersect to impact African and international security, and examines where and how climate change poses threats to stability in Africa through the use of geographic information system (GIS) maps. Ms. Krishnan explained that the program allows users to select and layer any combination of CCAPS data onto one map in order to visualize how climate change impacts and responses intersect with conflict, as well as aid disbursement. Currently, they are trying to take data and apply it to policy decisions for a timeframe that is sooner than 2100. However, she cautioned that CCAPS maps - and GIS maps in general - are not definitive and there are various ways to interpret data that is collected. The next important step is to ensure that the development of tools, like mapping, is transdisciplinary and information is provided in layman's terms in order to encourage local participation.\n\n1. The policy goal must be to build resilient communities through climate-proofed peacebuilding strategies that sequence activities appropriately and effectively.\n\n2. The approach for action should be holistic in nature and strive to enhance institutional flexibility, as well as government accountability.\n\n3. Enhancing the knowledge base so that it does not only flow from the Global North to the Global South, but also encourages South-South information sharing, as well as South-North.\n\n\"Climate science is based on a futuristic focus... we can plan and take action before a catastrophe happens. It is a common sense issue and we need to sell it to the politicians in this way. For example, everyone has fire insurance, even if there is a small probability a fire will happen because you are hedging your bets. It is about security, risk analysis scenarios and making informed decisions to spend resources to prevent possible negative occurrences.\"\n\n- Dr. Kevin Urama, Executive Director of the African Technology Policy Studies Network\n\nDAY TWO: SYNERGIES BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE AND PEACEBUILDING: HOW CAN COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICES\n\nBE STRENGTHENED TO SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION AND LEARNING?\n\nThe second day began with a negotiation simulation exercise designed by Tina Robiolle, Consultant, PhD Candidate, The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University, that was facilitated by John Katunga, Regional Technical Advisor for Peacebuilding and Justice in East Africa, Catholic Relief Services. The purpose of the exercise was to establish a scenario that was experiencing the early effects of climate change and predicting potential conflict between different communities within that setting. The objective was to create a situation, mirrored on current case studies, whereby the workshop participants would experience how conflict and climate change are interconnected and attempt to address potential issues in a peaceful and sustainable manner.\n\nThe setting took place in a fictional sub-Saharan African country where climate varied from the north to south and small-scale farming was the primary source of livelihood for 80 percent of households. Participants were assigned to one of four different roles - a representative of nomadic chiefs, an agriculture and water resources advisor to the central government, a governor of the province that is experiencing tension, and a village chief. It was noted in the background information made available to all roles that part of the country was experiencing longer periods of drought, affecting the traditional migration patterns of nomadic tribes and exacerbating decreasing water and agricultural resources on communities.\n\nThe participants broke into groups based on their allocated roles in order to discuss, identify, and define their interests. After approximately 45 minutes, they reconvened as a whole, but sent selected representatives to partake in a four-way simulated negotiation. One of the key outcomes from this exercise by all participants was the realization that, while there may be differences between peoples, there are also significant commonalities that can be utilized as a starting point for any negotiation. The major common thread that ran through the four roles was the necessity of security - security of person, community, food, and livelihood. Once this emerged, the entire room witnessed a change of tone and stance among the negotiating representatives from one that was self-serving to one of humanizing the other. The remainder of time was spent collaboratively brainstorming inclusive, sustainable ways of resolving the issues, taking into account shifting climate and associated impacts on livelihoods.\n\nHARNESSING AND IDENTIFYING SYNERGIES BETWEEN CCA AND PEACEBUILDING TO ASSIST GOVERNMENTS, COMMUNITIES, NGOS, AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE\n\nThe third roundtable discussion was led by Neil Levine, Director in the Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation at the U.S. Agency for International Development; Dr. Edna Wangui, Assistant Professor of Geography at Ohio University; Dr. Alfred Omenya, Associate Professor of Architecture and Head of School of the Built Environment at the University of Nairobi; and Ndey Bakurin, Director of the Intersectoral Network, National Environmental Agency, The Gambia.\n\nThis session tasked participants with critically analyzing how the fields of climate change adaptation, development, and peacebuilding can better serve each other's needs. Where can synchronization occur? What obstacles exist to synchronizing efforts? How can we build a Community of Practice for climate change adaptation and peacebuilding and work together to achieve multiple goals and objectives? Are there lessons among the participants that could be scaled to new areas for greater impact? What support could help catalyze such collaboration?\n\nMr. Levine began his remarks by giving an overview of USAID's efforts and activities in conflict resolution, including the recent launch of The New Deal for Fragile States, which emerged from the 4th High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness that took place in 2011 in Busan, South Korea. He acknowledged that USAID's conflict work adheres to the principles of Do No Harm and emphasized the importance of minimizing negative outcomes of development programs through conflict sensitivity. Mr. Levine noted that his office has embraced the New Deal's focus on the fragility and resilience of the state-society relationship, and they incorporated this perspective into their work where appropriate. He asked the participants whether similar tools and mechanisms exist within the climate change community, or whether those utilized in the conflict resolution field can be adapted to support the emergence of a new climate change and peacebuilding CoP.\n\nThe next three discussants presented on current field projects they are involved with. Dr. Wangui gave an overview of her current initiative, the Local Knowledge and Climate Change Adaptation Project, which is an international, inter-disciplinary research group made up of U.S. and Tanzanian university researchers. The research examines the humanenvironmental dynamics of local-level climate change adaptation along highland, midland, and lowland areas in northern Tanzania with the objective to understand the key interactions between local knowledge systems and adaptive capacity to climate change. Dr. Wangui highlighted obstacles they are finding in their research, which features intensive field research and participatory GIS (PGIS) tools. Some of these obstacles are that:\n\n\"Solutions are locally identified and locally owned. This is no longer jargon, but now practice.\"\n\n- Neil Levine, Director in the Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation at the U.S. Agency for International Development 1.There is an inherent lack of synergy between policies at the national level of government and local realities on the ground.\n\nDr. Omenya followed Dr. Wangui's remarks with a brief synopsis of a research project he is working on, focused on the Pokomo-Orma conflict, located by the Tana River in southeastern Kenya. He explained that this conflict is resource-based, primarily around availability of water and arable land, between Orma pastoralists and Polomo agriculturalists. While there are \"endless\" examples of community solutions and strategic frameworks at the national, regional, and continental levels, there remains a communication gap amongst the multiple-level stakeholders in devising policy to determine what approach would work best in which context. Dr. Omenya argued for multi-sector engagement at all levels of policy planning in order to address holistically climate change and conflict resolution.\n\nWhile working in the National Environment Agency of The Gambia, Ndey Bakurin asserted that her country has seen manifestations of climate change with regard to migratory patterns and the potential for conflict. She explained that The Gambia is experiencing an increase in immigration, which, combined with its internal population growth, is putting a strain on available resources such as water and land. She said that several studies have indicated that the country has a high vulnerability to climate change. Several national efforts to address climate change and mitigate the risk for conflict are the creation of a national climate change committee, with a regional integration office located in Senegal; an environmental action plan that disseminates information related to environmental and livelihood issues; and a United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) National Adaptation Programme of Action for The Gambia, which set up an early climate warning system. However, Ms. Bakurin identified the main challenge as synchronizing all of these efforts and integrating conflict resolution mechanisms with the various climate change mitigation and adaptation activities at all levels of society. She also stressed the importance of including women in these processes, as they are the largest affected population group and can contribute valuable skills and information when devising strategic approaches.\n\nDr. Edna Wangui, Assistant Professor of Geography at Ohio University 2. Conflict exists and is visible, even though there are no conflict resolution practitioners on the project.\n\n3. Access to technology is not gendered, but access to active technology may be skewed more towards men than women because of the limited resources available to charge batteries that power cell phones, computers, or other devices.\n\n4. The principles of Do No Harm are imperative to ensure the security of those participating in the project.\n\nThere were several themes that emerged throughout the two-day workshop.\n\nEMERGENT THEMES AND OBSERVATIONS:\n\n1. There are several overlapping concepts, terms, challenges, and opportunities in the fields of climate change and peacebuilding. Participants recognized that the topic of \"climate change adaptation and conflict\" implied multiple distinct, related, concepts and areas of inquiry:\n\n2. Climate Change is a potential security risk facing Africa that should be given serious priority, as it threatens to overburden states and regions with coordinating and organizing policies in countries already affected by conflicts.\n\n3. Climate change adaptation is crucial to achieving Africa's aspirations for peace, security, and sustainable developments.\n\n4. Currently, there is a huge gap between climate science, policymakers, and the end-users, in terms of understanding climate change and adaptation, and how that relates to conflict or peace.\n\n5. Participants identified the need for significant new case study work and collaborations across humanitarian, development, climate, and peacebuilding communities to engage in policy innovation in the field and analysis of effectiveness.\n\n6. With the emergence of this joint community comes the task of developing a comprehensive theoretical framework that can then be implemented through policy and practice.\n\n7. Although frameworks and strategic policy documents have been developed in some cases, there is an urgent need to strengthen coordination both vertically and horizontally, with specific emphasis on the inclusion of end-users in the decision- and policy-making process.\n\n8. Currently, there exists a challenge in garnering both financial resources and political will to implement climate change adaptation policy, particularly with a conflict prevention or resolution component.\n\n9. Responsibility and roles of the stakeholders and end-users, and sustainability of those measures, are crucial to the success of climate change adaptation policy.\n\nRECOMMENDED FIRST STEPS\n\nThere was strong interest among participants to build a new Community of Practice that would focus on sub-Saharan Africa and connect with other initial efforts focusing on Africa and other parts of the world. Below are several recommendations from participants that are first steps towards establishing this new, inclusive community.\n\n1. Utilize an online communications network for practitioners, researchers, and policymakers from the climate change and peacebuilding fields to enable follow-on collaboration among workshop participants and provide resources for other interested parties. In order for such an effort to be successful, partnerships of different stakeholders would need to contribute to the discussion and development of the CoP.\n\n2. Practical steps would include helping develop competency in the languages of each community. The \"Terminology Soup\" exercise should be used to develop a new transdisciplinary glossary of terms.\n\n3. Begin to develop a technical and theoretical framework for the new conjoined field that can help clarify to donors and policymakers its goals, objectives, and importance in supporting resiliency and sustainability. Participants were enthusiastic about a potential climate change and peacebuilding toolkit modeled after the USAID CMM series or as part of that series, which would provide practical steps for integrating conflict analysis models and climate change adaptation.\n\n4. Scale down climate information and forecasting at the community level so that they can be prepared for adverse effects of climate change.\n\n5. Integrate the indigenous knowledge and practice into data analysis; indigenous knowledge can also help mitigate the impact of climate change.\n\nWorkshop Outcomes and Recommendations g. Activities related to other development areas being adapted to be more climate- and conflict-resilient 6. Effort should be made to increase coordination across ministries and sectors, and to raise the issue of climate change to a higher political priority.\n\n7. There is also a need to mainstream climate change adaptation into the rural development process, as well as gender streaming.\n\n8. Adaptation should start with an inclusive participatory method of data collection with all stakeholders to understand vulnerability of elements such as water, grazing land, and agriculture.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE FOLLOW-ON\n\nWORKSHOP IN ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA:\n\nParticipants saw value in continuing efforts to raise awareness for policy audiences on climate change adaptation and peacebuilding, using select examples and case studies to support their message. The specific deliverables listed below could be pursued in a twostep process of building out a network and engaging policy, donor, government, and community officials through existing institutions, such as the African Union.\n\n1. Host two separate meetings - one for policymakers, overlapping with those who will attend the ClimDev conference, and a second for researchers and practitioners to move forward on the recommended first steps.\n\n2. Identify policymakers at the African Union and state levels, donor community, international organizations, civil society organizations, academics, and the end-users/local stakeholders to participate in the meeting(s).\n\n3. Devise effective strategies to influence donors in order to raise financial and political support for this new field of practice.\n\n4. Align the researcher/practitioner meeting with the annual ClimDev conference, scheduled to take place in October 2013 at the African Union.\n\n5. Adapt and update simulation for streamlining purposes to be used in CCA and peacebuilding trainings and seminars.\n\n6. Propose new projects/activities related to CCA and identify ways to strengthen existing regional institutions focused on adaptation.\n\n7. Support efforts to capture co-benefits between CCA and peacebuilding and support efforts to systematically assess those efforts.","uri":"http://graph.causeex.com/documents/sources#ab012fd2ba96ef9a44f715bad6797b67","source_uri":"/home/centos/mitre-dart-in-a-box-docs/all/19436.pdf","extracted_ntriples":"<http://graph.causeex.com/documents/sources#ab012fd2ba96ef9a44f715bad6797b67>
