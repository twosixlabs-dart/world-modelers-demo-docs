Above-average seasonal rainfall during early November has helped to alleviate early season moisture deficits across Somalia and eastern Kenya. However, dryness remains in parts of the northern Somali region of eastern Ethiopia. Moisture recovery is unlikely in the northern region, as seasonal rains are expected to be concentrated towards the south through November.\n\n2. Below-average low rainfall since mid-October has resulted in considerable moisture deficits across several provinces of South Africa and in Lesotho and Swaziland.\n\n3. Although rainfall has improved in some areas of southern Madagascar in mid-November, many local areas in the south continue to report seasonal moisture deficits.\n\nWeather Hazards Summary\n\nAfrica Overview\n\nLimited rain recorded Kenya and Tanzania During the last week, a small increase in rainfall was recorded across central and southern Somalia, with continued low amounts recorded throughout Kenya and in parts of Tanzania. According to satellite rainfall estimates, the highest weekly accumulations were recorded over the Lake Victoria region, with well distributed moderate amounts (>25mm) over northwestern Tanzania and lighter amounts (2-25mm) recorded over southwestern Ethiopia, Somalia, and southern Kenya (Figure 1).\n\nSince the beginning of October, several consecutive weeks of below-average rainfall resulted in early season dryness throughout the Horn. By early November, significantly heavy rainfall in parts of southern Ethiopia, Somalia, and northern Kenya helped to offset the unusual dryness. However, these seasonal rains were short-lived and were not sufficiently well distributed to improve dryness experienced in southern portions of Kenya and Tanzania. Analysis of the rainfall performance during November suggests driest conditions located in the Isiolo, Marsabit, southern Wajir, Garissa, Tana, Kitui, Makueni regions of Kenya, and in the Arusha, Kilimanjaro and Tanga regions of Tanzania (Figure 2).\n\nNext week, models suggest a more seasonable distribution of rainfall for early December, with amounts ranging between 10- 25mm over Kenya and Tanzania, with the potential for locally heavy rains over the Lake Victoria region.\n\nSeasonable rainfall received throughout southern Africa Over the past several weeks, the lack of early season rainfall over South Africa has resulted in the development of widespread moisture deficits, particularly in the western portion of the Maize Triangle. Rainfall received last week did help to provide moisture relief on the short-term, however, several local areas in the North West, Gauteng, Free State Limpopo region of South Africa, and neighboring regions of Botswana remain below average (25-80% of normal) since the end of October (Figure 2). Above-average rainfall is needed in the next few weeks to further eliminate early season moisture deficits.\n\nIn Madagascar, heavy rain continued last week in the central and eastern provinces of the island. More moderate and widespread rainfall was recorded in the south, however persistently poor rains during September and October have left many coastal areas in southern Madagascar below-average for the season. Forecasts suggest an improvement in seasonal rainfall during early December.\n\nFigure 1: RFE2 Satellite-Estimated Rainfall (mm) Valid: November 22 - 28, 2017\n\nFigure 2: ARC 2-Month Percent of Normal (%) Valid: October 1 - November 28, 2017\n\nSource: NOAA/CPC\n\nCentral Asia Weather Hazards\n\nCentral America and the Caribbean Weather Hazards\n\nTemperatures\n\nAbove-normal temperatures (2-8째C) were recorded across the central and northern portions of the region last week. Maximum temperatures reached 30째C in southern Turkmenistan, and minimum temperatures were as low as -21째C in northeastern Kazakhstan. Next week, aboveaverage temperatures (4-8째C above average) are forecast in Kazakhstan and northern Uzbekistan. Southern portions of the region should remain closer to normal, with subfreezing low temperatures widely expected across the region.\n\nPrecipitation A low pressure system brought scattered moderate (5- 25mm) rainfall across central portions of the region during the past week. Despite recent rainfall in Pakistan and Afghanistan, abnormal dryness remains in northern Pakistan where precipitation deficits range from 25-100mm over the past 30 days. Some moisture deficits are also beginning to develop around Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and southern Kazakhstan, where snow cover is below-average.\n\nNext week, light rainfall is forecast across Kazakhstan. More significant (10-50mm+ liquid equivalent) precipitation in the form of snow is expected in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, where a heavy snow polygon is posted. This should help reverse the drying trend present in these countries.\n\nNo Hazards Posted for\n\nCentral America\n\nNo hazards posted\n\nABOUT WEATHER HAZARDS Hazard maps are based on current weather/climate information, short and medium range weather forecasts (up to 1 week) and their potential impact on crop and pasture conditions. Shaded polygons are added in areas where anomalous conditions have been observed. The boundaries of these polygons are only approximate at this continental scale. This product does not reflect long range seasonal climate forecasts or indicate current or projected food security conditions.\n\nCentral America and the Caribbean Overview\n\nA rapid strengthening of thirty-day rainfall deficits was recorded in Central America over the past four weeks. Rainfall anomalies indicated moderate to large (50-200mm) moisture deficits throughout much of the region. The resulting dry soil, combined with strong surface winds may be conducive to forest fires in many local areas. Last week, below-average rain was recorded throughout Central America, except Costa Rica and Panama, where moderate to heavy rain continued. An analysis of the ninety-day percent of normal rainfall showed a favorable performance, except in areas along the Honduran-Nicaragua border where cumulative rain accounted for between 50-80% of average. Recent vegetation health index displayed positive conditions across the region.\n\nFor next week, a seasonally drier weather pattern is expected to continue over the interior of Central America. Light to locally moderate rain fall is forecast along the Atlantic Basin of the region. Although minimum temperature is expected to remain near to above-freezing, the forecast low minimum temperatures could negatively impact the livelihoods of local residents over the higher terrains of Central America.\n\nLittle rain forecast over Hispaniola next week\n\nLast week, little to light rain was recorded across the Southern Peninsula of Haiti and southern and eastern portions of the Dominican Republic. Below-average rain was recorded elsewhere. Compared to data in record, this past week's rainfall totals were mostly average. Over the past thirty days, heavy rain helped reduce or eliminate thirty-day moisture deficits over most dry portions of Hispaniola during mid-November. An analysis of the percent of normal rainfall since late August to date, however, indicated that the Ouest, Ile de la Gonave, and Nippes departments of Haiti, and Duarte province of the Dominican Republic received only 50-80% of average rainfall. Despite unevenly-distributed rain over the past several weeks, vegetation conditions were mostly favorable. During the next week, drier weather is expected to continue over Hispaniola, with little to light rain over the central and coastal areas.\n\nFigure 5: CMORPH rainfall climatology (mm) Valid: November
