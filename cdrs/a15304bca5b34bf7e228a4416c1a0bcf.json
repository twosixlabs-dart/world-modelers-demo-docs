Drought is heavily impacting the livelihoods of livestock-dependent communities, with extremely limited pasture and water causing abnormal migrations, widespread livestock deaths, enhanced morbidity rates and extreme emaciation.  Food insecurity has surged since the beginning of the year. As of May, 7.8 million Ethiopians are in need of emergency food aid, a 39 percent increase since mid-January. Malnutrition rates are also increasing and extreme coping mechanisms are observed.  Maize and sorghum production is threatened by the spread of a new pest. Presence of the fall armyworm has been reported in three regions, raising concerns over the rapid geographic spread of the infestation and potential for significant crop damage.\n\n FAO urgently requires USD 8.4 million to address the needs of drought-affected pastoralists in southern and southeastern Ethiopia. Funding needs are likely to increase once the upcoming post-belg/gu/genna assessment has been conducted.\n\nMAP\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe failure of the October-December rains - one of two main rainfall seasons in southern and southeastern Ethiopia, accounting for 35 percent of annual rainfall (also known as deyr or hagaya) - resulted in significant pasture and water deficits, severely affecting livestock-dependent households in Oromia, SNNP and Somali Regions. Influenced by the strongest negative Indian Ocean Dipole in 50 years, the drought is regional in scale, affecting neighbouring livestock-holding communities in Djibouti, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan and Uganda. A large influx of livestock to and from neighbouring countries has been observed. Abnormal migrations, high livestock mortality rates, outbreaks of opportunistic diseases and extreme emaciation have been reported - thousands of livestock are unable to stand without assistance. Demand remains high for water trucking across affected communities, and hundreds of thousands of livestock require survival and supplementary feed. With many households not yet recovered from the El Niño drought of 2015/16 that caused widespread crop shortages, livestock losses and food insecurity, this current crisis is exacerbating an already precarious situation. By May 2017, food insecurity had surged from 5.6 million people to nearly 7.8 million - a 39 percent increase since mid-January. Spring gu/genna (March to May) rainfall is currently well below average, intensifying fears that the situation will continue to deteriorate, further compromising the food security, nutrition and livelihoods of people in worst-affected areas.\n\nHOTSPOT CLASSIFICATION (Source: Government of Ethiopia and humanitarian partners, December 2016*)\n\nHotspot woreda classification has been derived using six multisector indicators, including agriculture and nutrition, agreed at zonal, regional and federal levels. A hotspot matrix is often used as a proxy for the Integrated Phase Food Security Classification (IPC). *The woreda prioritization process is currently ongoing; it is expected that the latest hotspot classification will be updated in the coming weeks.\n\nCHALLENGES FACING FOOD AND AGRICULTURE\n\nIn drought-affected Oromia, SNNP and Somali Regions, pastoralists are striving to save their livelihoods amid parched rangelands and scarce water sources. Many are forced to risk maintaining livestock that may perish, or sell a portion of their herds at extremely low prices to reduce pressure on remaining feed reserves for the survival of core breeding stock. A glut of livestock in poor condition at market has resulted in significantly lower than normal prices paid to sellers (frequently as low as 10 percent the average). Milk production has largely ceased, and income generation is low. The rising costs of staple foods are further constraining households' ability to withstand the crisis. Adverse terms of trade for pastoralists are particularly pronounced in southern zones of Somali Region. Accounts of extreme coping mechanisms are widespread, such as skipping meals, reducing portion sizes, eating less diversely and selling remaining productive assets to purchase food. These impacts are likely to continue until the deyr/hagaya rains, expected in October 2017.\n\nInfestation of a pest new to Ethiopia - the fall armyworm - is raising concerns over potential impact on food security and nutrition in the crop-dependent central, western and northern parts of Ethiopia. First reported in SNNP Region in March 2017, it has since spread to neighbouring Gambella and Oromia Regions. The fall armyworm affects crops (e.g. maize and sorghum) at all growth stages, thereby representing a significant risk to Ethiopia's national cereal production this year. If the spread is not controlled, up to 2 million ha of the country's main crops may be compromised.\n\nFAO PRIORITIES, RESPONSE AND FUNDING\n\nPRIORITY ACTIVITIES IN 2017 ACHIEVEMENTS TO-DATE IN 2017\n\n Expanding coverage of:\n\n- Supplementary animal feed for core breeding stock - Vaccination and treatment interventions - Livestock destocking - Water point rehabilitation - Capacity building of community-based animal health workers\n\n Support fodder production and conservation\n\n Enhancing pest and disease surveillance and control  Promotion of climate-smart and conservation agriculture techniques  Small-scale irrigation and water harvesting  Community and school gardens\n\nLivelihood support for refugees and host communities:  Alternative livelihood support  Animal health interventions  Backyard gardens  Energy-saving interventions\n\n Support to national- and regional-level coordination  Food security, livelihood, seed, crop & livestock assessments\n\n Destocked 22 073 cattle, sheep and goats, increasing the income of 15 158 households and improving the nutritional intake of 43 436 households.\n\n Provided animal feed to 25 675 animals belonging to 6 075 households.\n\n Treated 119 516 livestock owned by 11 951 households.\n\n Rehabilitating 10 water points.\n\n Capacity building of animal health workers.\n\n Monitoring of fall armyworm spread through technical and financial support.\n\n Undertaking seed policy review on request of the Government of Ethiopia.\n\n Undertook fall armyworm assessment, in tandem with the Government, to understand the reach and severity of this infestation.\n\n Finalized the 2017 Seed Systems Security Assessment.\n\n Coordination of seed interventions at national, regional and zonal levels, contributing to a more streamlined, efficient response.\n\nFUNDING ASSESSMENTS The Government-led post-belg season assessment is slated to commence in late May. Teams of FAO technical experts will be deployed to support on the ground.\n\nThe FAO/Government assessment on the fall armyworm infestation found that 32 116 ha of maize (12.5 percent of the total area planted with the crop) were infested. Currently, 77 percent of the affected crops has been controlled or treated.\n\nReleased in March, the findings of the 2017 Seed System Security Assessment contributed to guiding seed interventions in Ethiopia this year. It was found the majority of farming households have sufficient access to quality and preferred types of seed and planting materials, which is extremely positive following mass seed insecurity in 2016 resulting from the El Niño-induced drought. Also examined were crop varietal diversity and suitability, use of productive inputs (e.g. fertilizer, pesticides), and related challenges.\n\nCONTACT Amadou Allahoury | FAO Representative | Addis
