Due to poor rainfall since November western Namibia is in a severe drought. Conditions may worsen as limited rain is forecast next week.\n\n2. In southwestern Madagascar, an uneven and inadequate rainfall distribution since the start of the rainfall season has resulted in severe drought. Drought conditions are likely to persist.\n\n3. Insufficient rain since January has resulted in large moisture deficits and below-average vegetation conditions over portions of northwestern Angola.\n\n4. Below-average rain over the past four weeks has led to large moisture deficits and poor ground conditions over portions of the Nampula province of northern Mozambique.\n\n5. Poorly-distributed rain since late February has resulted in abnormal dryness across central and northeastern Ethiopia.\n\n6. A slow onset to seasonal rainfall across the southern Gulf of Guinea countries has led to strengthening moisture deficits throughout the region.\n\n7. Several consecutive weeks of enhanced rainfall over many parts of Kenya, southern Somalia, and coastal Tanzania has led to flooding. Continued heavy rainfall is forecast through mid-April which is likely to trigger additional floods. The middle and Lower Shabelle is at risk of reaching flood stage.\n\n1 2\n\n1 4\n\nWeather Hazards Summary\n\nAfrica Overview\n\nRainfall brings some relief to Ethiopia During the last week, torrential and widespread seasonal rainfall was observed across the Greater Horn of Africa. Light to moderate rains continued over northern Belg-producing areas of Ethiopia. Further south, widely distributed heavy rainfall was received throughout Uganda, Kenya, southern Somalia, and Tanzania, with local areas receiving more than 150mm (Figure 1). The rains caused flooding in many areas of Kenya and in the Dar Es Salaam region of coastal Tanzania. Towards the west, rainfall was average in South Sudan.\n\nMany Belg-producing regions of Ethiopia have experienced a delay in seasonal rainfall, with moisture shortages having rapidly developed throughout the month of March. While rainfall during April has helped to mitigate anomalous dryness in some areas, there are still many areas in the northern Oromia, eastern Amhara, eastern Tigray, and northern Somali that remain well below average since early March (Figure 2). The largest moisture deficits remain near Dire Dawa over the Shinile zone of Ethiopia, where many local areas have experienced less than a quarter of their normal rainfall accumulation for period. There is not much opportunity for moisture recovery before the season ends.\n\nFurther south, significantly high moisture surpluses (100- 200mm) continue in much of Kenya and northern Tanzania due to heavy rainfall during March. With last week's moderate to locally heavy rainfall over the Kisumu, Samburu, Turkana regions, and Tana River basin, saturated ground conditions are likely to sustain the risk for localized flash floods and river basin inundation over Kenya.The last 10 days have brought a much needed increase in rains to northwestern Angola. More than 50mm of rain have helped to mitigate moisture deficits that had been growing larger there.\n\nNext week, rainfall will continue over all of East Africa. Widespread weekly totals in excess of 50mmare expected throughout southern and eastern Ethiopia.\n\nDelayed rainfall in Gulf of Guinea countries For the several consecutive weeks, little rain has been recorded in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and southwestern Nigeria. Since early March, moisture deficits have increased, leaving many local areas with less than half of their normally accumulated rainfall.\n\nDuring the next week, above-average rainfall is forecast for many western Gulf of Guinea countries.\n\nSource: NOAA/CPC\n\nNote: The hazards outlook map on page 1 is based on current weather/climate information and short and medium range weather forecasts (up to 1 week).

Light to moderate rains continued over northern Belg-producing areas of Ethiopia. Further south, widely distributed heavy rainfall was received throughout Uganda, Kenya, southern Somalia, and T nzania, with local areas receiving more than 150mm (Figure 1). The Heaviest rains caused flooding issues and fatalities in many areas of Kenya and in the Dar Es Salaam region of coastal Tanzania. Towards the west, a favorable distribution of rains was recorded in South Sudan.\n\nThe recent increase in seasonal rainfall across the Horn was needed, as many Belg producing regions of Ethiopia have experienced a pronounced delay in easonal ra nfall, with moisture shortages having rapidly developed throughout the month of March. While the enhanced precipitation during April has helped to mitigate anomalous dryness in some areas, there are still many areas in the northern Oromia, eastern Amhara, eastern Tigray, and northern Somali that remain well below average since early March (Figure 2). The largest moisture deficits remain near Dire Dawa over the Shinile zone of Ethiopia, where many local areas have experienced less than a quarter of their normal rainfall accumulation for peri d. The continuation of suppressed precipitation in April would be likely to adversely impact ground conditions and cropping activities, as there is not much opportunity for moisture recovery before rains begin their cessation in May over the region.\n\nFurther south, significantly high moisture surpluses (100-200mm) continue to ncompass much of Kenya and northern Tanzania due to heavy rainfall during March. With last week's moderate to locally heavy rainfall over the Kisumu, Samburu, Turkana regions, and Tana River basin, saturated ground conditions are likely to sustain the risk for localized flash floods and river basin inundation over Kenya.\n\nThe last 10 days have brought a much needed increase in rains to northwestern A gol . More than 50mm of rain have helped to mitigate moisture deficits t at had been rowing larg r there.\n\nFor the upcoming outlook period, models suggest the continuation of significantly heavy rainfall over all of East Africa. Widespread weekly accumulations in excess of 50mm, and locally higher, are expected throughout southern and eastern Ethiopia, with higher amounts also expected across many Belg producing areas to help continue to alleviate seasonal dryness.\n\nDelayed onset of rains observed across southern Gulf of Guinea countries.\n\nFor several consecutive weeks, light and poorly distributed rainfall amounts have been observed over southern Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and southwestern Nigeria according to satellite rainfall estimates. Improved rainfall was observed in southern Togo and Benin. Since early March, early seasonal moisture deficits have increased, leaving many local areas with half of their normally accumulated rainfall, which is expected to increase the risk for adverse ground impacts unfavorable for cropping activities.\n\nDuring the next week, below-average rain is forecast for many Gulf of Guinea countries. Expect 7-day totals to remain less than 50mm.\n\nSatellite Estimated Total Rainfall (mm) Valid: April 11 - April 17, 2018\n\nFigure 1: NOAA/CPC\n\nSatellite Estimated Rainfall Anomaly (mm) Valid: March 19 - April 17, 2018\n\nFigure 2: NOAA/CPC\n\nNote: The hazard outlook map on p ge 1 is b sed on current weather/climate information and short and medium range weather forecasts (up to 1 week).

Expect 7-day totals to remain less than 50mm.\n\nFigure 1: RFE2 Satellite Estimated Rainfall (mm) Valid: April 11 - 17, 2018\n\nFigure 2: ARC 30-day Total Rainfall Anomaly Valid: March 19 - April 17, 2018\n\nCentral Asia Weather Hazards\n\nCentral America and the Caribbean Weather Hazards\n\nFlooding Abnormal Dryness Drought Severe Drought Tropical Cyclone Potential Locust Outbreak Heavy Snow Abnormal Cold Abnormal Heat Temperatures Near to above-normal temperatures persisted through the second week of April. Maximum temperatures as high as 33°C were recorded in southern Turkmenistan and the bordering areas with Afghanistan. Below-normal temperatures are forecast early next week. Although above-normal temperatures are forecast to return later in the outlook period, abnormal heat is unlikely.\n\nPrecipitation Widespread precipitation (2-22mm) was recorded across northern and eastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan from April 8 to 14. Based on this recent heavy precipitation, a decrease in the coverage of abnormal dryness and drought is warranted for extreme northeast Afghanistan and northern Pakistan. Drought hazards are posted for parts of Afghanistan and adjacent countries based on: large long-term precipitation deficits, low snow water content, and expected negative impacts to agriculture.\n\nNext week, heavy precipitation (25 to 50 mm) is expected across northern and central Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and northern Pakistan. Locally heavy snow is expected across the highest elevations of central and northeast Afghanistan during mid-April. This precipitation is likely to increase soil moisture but may only provide a slight increase to irrigation supplies. The ongoing drought hazards are expected to be modified in subsequent outlooks.\n\nNo hazards reported\n\nCentral America and the Caribbean Overview\n\nTypical rainfall recorded in Central America Seasonal precipitation fell across Guatemala and portions of El Salvador and Honduras last week. The highest weekly accumulations (100mm) were recorded in El Salvador and along the northern coast of Honduras. Many other areas in Nicaragua and eastern Honduras remained dry. Several interior departments of Guatemala and Honduras have yet to record an increase in rainfall. Similar conditions have also been observed across parts of Costa Rica and Panama. However, remotely sensed vegetation health indices indicate generally satisfactory ground conditions despite the seasonably dry conditions during February and March, though there is a recent degrading trend.\n\nDuring the next week, rainfall is expected over much of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras - consistent with a typical Primera onset. A favorable, widespread distribution of 25-50mm of rainfall is expected for these areas. More atypically, potentially heavy rainfall accumulations in excess of 75mm are possible across eastern Nicaragua and Honduras.\n\nLight rains recorded in Dominican Republic Seven-day totals of up to 25mm were observed in central Haiti. Elsewhere across the island, rains were very light. Though rain should begin to become more prevalent in April, the past week's pattern only resulted in small negative anomalies, mainly in northern Dominican Republic. Since early March, deficits have ranged between 10-50mm. Ground conditions are favorable across Hispaniola, however, a negative trend is emerging in some areas. Next week, rainfall exceeding 50mm is forecasted in many areas of Haiti and Dominican Republic. These would be the first substantial rains for some interior portions of the island in many weeks.\n\nABOUT WEATHER HAZARDS Hazard maps are based on current weather/climate information, short and medium range weather forecasts (up to 1 week) and their potential impact on crop and pasture conditions.

During the second week of April, seasonal precipitation became more widespread across Guatemala and portions of El Salvador and Honduras. The highest weekly accumulations (~100mm) were recorded in El Salvador and local areas along the northern coast of Honduras according to both satellite rainfall estimates and GTS rain gauge measurements. Towards the south and east, many other regions in and Nicaragua and eastern Honduras remained dry with little to no rains received. Over the past 30 days, analysis of early Primera season moisture anomalies suggest a slight strengthening of below-average conditions, as several interior departments of Guatemala and Honduras have yet to observe an increase in rainfall. Similar conditions have also been observed across parts of Costa Rica and Panama. However, remotely sensed vegetation health indices indicate generally satisfactory ground conditions despite the seasonably dry conditions during February and March, though there is a recent degrading trend. During the next week, models again suggest an enhancement in precipitation over much of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras - consistent with a typical Primera onset. A favorable, widespread distribution of 25-50mm of rainfall is expected for these areas. More atypically, potentially heavy rainfall accumulations in excess of 75mm are possible across eastern Nicaragua and Honduras.\n\nWeek 1 Rainfall Total Forecast and CMORPH climatology (mm) April 19 -
