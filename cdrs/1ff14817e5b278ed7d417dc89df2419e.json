In its efforts to achieve this objective, the Office strives to ensure that everyone can exercise the right to seek asylum and find safe refuge in another State, and to return home voluntarily.\n\nBy assisting refugees to return to their own country or to settle permanently in another country, UNHCR also seeks lasting solutions to their plight.\n\nUNHCR's Executive Committee (106 Member States as of October 2019) and the UN General Assembly have authorized involvement with other groups. These include former refugees who have returned to their homeland, internally displaced people, and persons who are stateless or whose nationality is disputed.\n\nThe Office seeks to reduce situations of forced displacement by encouraging States and other institutions to create conditions which are conducive to the protection of human rights and the peaceful resolution of disputes. In all of its activities, it pays particular attention to the needs of children and seeks to promote the equal rights of women and girls.\n\nThe Office carries out its work in collaboration with many partners, including governments, regional organizations, and international and non-governmental organizations. It is committed to the principle of participation, believing that refugees and others who benefit from the Office's activities should be consulted over decisions which affect their lives.\n\nGLOBAL WORKFORCE\n\nSTAFF MEMBERS\n\nGender breakdowns of UNHCR workforce\n\n58% 42%\n\n56% 44%\n\nGlobal workforce by category\n\nInternational\n\nAffiliate\n\n21%\n\n27%\n\nField\n\n11%\n\n38%\n\nHQs\n\n50%\n\nIDPs 6.6M 2.7M\n\nThe Syrian Arab\n\nRepublic (Syria)\n\nAfghanistan 2.2M\n\nSouth Sudan 3.6M Venezuelans displaced abroad**\n\n24%\n\n6.1M Others of concern\n\n**See footnote (6) in map of global populations of concern 4.2M\n\nStateless persons*\n\n5.7M\n\nReturnees (Refugees and IDPs)\n\nUnresolved conflicts and insecurity in countries of origin presented major constraints for returns and their sustainability.\n\n43.5M IDPs\n\nMany IDPs were in protracted situations characterized by critical protection and humanitarian challenges.\n\n44% were in three countries\n\n95,000\n\nSyria\n\n46,500\n\nCentral African\n\nRepublic 6.1M\n\n8M\n\nLargest IDP returns 2.1M\n\n90%\n\nNational\n\n52%\n\n* UNVs, individual contractors and consultants hired through UNOPS or directly, deployees, secondees and interns.\n\n13%\n\nMiddle East and\n\nNorth Africa\n\n10%\n\nGlobal\n\nHQs 10%\n\n5%\n\nStateless*\n\n99,800\n\n57% coming from three countries\n\nTurkey\n\n18%\n\n(pending cases)\n\nGlobal presence by region\n\n15%\n\nThe Americas 3%\n\nLargest refugee returns\n\n4,631\n\nOther\n\n20%\n\n31%\n\nAFFILIATE WORKFORCE*\n\n12,833\n\n17,464\n\nAsia and Pacific\n\n* Includes 1,113,315 stateless persons of\n\nRohingya ethnicity who are also counted as refugees, asylum-seekers or others of concern in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand or as IDPs in Myanmar.\n\nUNHCR is present in 130 countries and territories with offices in 507 locations\n\n4% Venezuelans displaced abroad**\n\n7% Others of concern\n\n81,100 formerly stateless individuals acquired a nationality or had their nationality confirmed in 26 countries\n\nGlobal presence\n\n39% 61%\n\nRefugee populations by region of asylum\n\n(Refugees and IDPs)\n\nAs of December 2019, 94 States are parties to the\n\nConvention relating to the Status of Stateless 1954\n\nPersons and 74 to the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.\n\nThe Americas: 1.9 million Europe: 1.2 million\n\nAfrica: 529,600\n\n20.4M Refugees\n\nReturnees\n\nThe High Commissioner for Refugees is mandated by the United Nations to lead and coordinate international action for the worldwide protection of refugees and the resolution of refugee problems.

The number of refugees under\n\nUNHCR's responsibility almost doubled, from 10.4 to 20.4 million, and internal displacement grew by more than 60% from 27.1 million people to 43.5 million.\n\nTwo of the biggest and most complex crises currently facing us did not exist in 2009. Then, the Syrian Arab Republic\n\n(Syria) hosted over one million refugees, the third highest number worldwide, most of whom were from Iraq. By the end of 2019, however, it had become the epicentre of the largest displacement crisis in decades, with nearly 15 million of its people-well over half of its pre-war population-displaced inside the country or abroad.\n\nIn December 2009, more than\n\n300,000 refugees had recently returned home to southern Sudan as hopes for a peaceful and prosperous future grew after the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005. A decade later, more than 2.2 million refugees have fled a brutal civil war, and some 1.67 million people are displaced within the world's newest country.\n\nCrises persisted in Afghanistan, the\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo,\n\n© UNHCR/Ivor Prickett\n\nHaving fled Afghanistan 40 years ago, Abdul Rashid is a refugee in Pakistan. Now in his 70s, he sells qabli-an Afghan dish his family makes with rice, chicken, raisins and cumin-on the streets of Quetta.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 9 and Somalia, and new or recurring crises in many other countries required large-scale emergency responses.\n\nWhile the vast majority of refugees remained in regions of origin, responses to mixed movements, consisting of refugees and migrants on the move for different reasons, became more complex and politically charged, as was the case of the influx of more than a million refugees and migrants into Europe in 2015. The complexity of population flows deepened as climate change, weak governance, inequitable development, urban violence, organized crime and transnational extremist networks wreaked havoc and despair across communities and regions.\n\nAs these fault-lines widened, the number of refugees continued to grow.\n\nOV E R V I E W I F O R E W O R D BY H I G H C O M M I S S I O N E R F I L I P P O G R A N D I\n\nWith few political solutions reached, voluntary repatriation benefited an average of just under 400,000 refugees per year.\n\nResettlement as a solution declined. There was a net drop in refugees departing for resettlement, with some 86,200 refugees resettled in 2009, but only 63,726 in 2019, and this over a period during which the number of refugees doubled. the Congo, Iraq, Syria, Ukraine, Yemen and the Lake Chad Basin remained among the\n\nOffice's most politically and operationally complex, and represented important priorities.\n\nThe situation of stateless people also took on greater prominence, as UNHCR's ten-year #IBelong Campaign reached the half-way mark in 2019. UNHCR accelerated its work with States and other partners to eradicate statelessness, including through the High-Level Segment in October 2019, which resulted in some 360 pledges from\n\nStates, as well as from international 66 and regional entities and civil society organizations.\n\nAs the decade drew to a close, UNHCR was also stepping up its engagement with the over 43.5 million internally displaced people around the world. A new policy on internal displacement was issued in 2019, placing particular emphasis on protection leadership, solutions and aligning interventions with those of partners.\n\nMajor IDP operations in the Central African\n\nRepublic, the Democratic Republic of\n\n© UNHCR/Georgina Goodwin\n\nIn Nyarugusu camp, in the United Republic of Tanzania, the High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi talks with an elderly Congolese refugee.\n\nLast but not least, by the end of the decade the climate emergency had taken on considerable prominence, and climate-related causes had become a growing driver of displacement. UNHCR stepped up its work to highlight in particular the protection gaps resulting from climate-driven cross-border displacement and helped steer the policy and normative debate.\n\nIt also continued to work to help governments deliver an operational response to disaster-related displacement, guided by protection considerations.\n\nFurther, in Bangladesh and elsewhere,\n\nUNHCR reduced the environmental impact of refugee crises through renewable energy options, reforestation, and the provision of clean fuels. Conscious of its own environmental impact, UNHCR worked to measure and reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nIn the course of the decade, it became clear that tackling the challenge of refugee crises and their complex root causes, called for a bigger and broader ambition than had been evident in the past. This vision shaped the Global Compact on Refugees, grounded in more equitable and predictable burden- and responsibilitysharing by the international community, and led to the Global Refugee Forum in December 2019.\n\nThrough its burden- and responsibility-sharing arrangements, the Compact built on and accelerated many of the trends that had been emerging in the course of the decade-the growing involvement of the private sector; the drive for practical instruments to bridge the humanitariandevelopment divide, recognizing the impact of large refugee flows for development outcomes in hosting States; and a shift from camp-based assistance models that entrenched exclusion towards a more inclusive one based on building the resilience of both refugees and their hosts. The Compact is notable for its comprehensive approach that preserves the humanitarian imperative, but brings in peacebuilding, development action and private sector investment, seeks to leverage the Sustainable Development\n\nGoals, and draws on synergies with UN reforms.\n\nIn the East and Horn of Africa, for example, the regional application of the\n\nComprehensive Refugee Response model by the Intergovernmental Authority for\n\nDevelopment is helping strengthen asylum, access to rights, and refugee inclusion in health, education and national economies.\n\nIn Latin America, too, a regional application has helped build a coherent response in a context of high mobility. Expertise and financing from the World Bank and other international financial institutions, bilateral development support and private sector investments are helping drive these achievements and so transforming the lives of refugees and refugee-hosting communities and providing models for the Compact's application elsewhere.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 11\n\nOV E R V I E W I S P E C I A L E N VOY\n\nIt saw our needs-based budget increase from $2.3 billion to $8.6 billion. UNHCR received strong and steadfast support from its donors throughout the decade, and accelerated efforts to diversify its funding base in the spirit of responsibility-sharing and ensuring a stable platform for its work.\n\nNowhere was this more notable than in the success of UNHCR's private sector fundraising, growing from $50.7 million in 2009 to $421.7 million in 2019. Overall funds available to UNHCR in 2019 reached $4.8 billion; however, the gap between requirements and available resources remained at around 42% throughout the decade.\n\nThe number of regular staffincreased from\n\n6,000 to over 12,800, and by the end of the entire workforce exceeded 17,460, 2019 of whom 44% were female, and 90% of which was in the field. The number of countries and territories where UNHCR was present increased from 126 to 130. UNHCR's regionalization and decentralization process, undertaken in the course of 2019, brought greater authority and flexibility for country offices, front-loading support through bureaux located in their regions, as part of a wider transformation process.\n\nRisk management was strengthened across the Office, and systems and tools were reinforced for preventing and responding to misconduct, including sexual exploitation and abuse, and sexual harassment.\n\nThese will remain important priorities in the coming years.\n\nUNHCR also continued to invest in the quality of its work, improving and streamlining systems and processes, creating space for innovation, and increasing efficiency, in line with its Grand Bargain commitments and as an active participant in broader UN reforms. A Joint Data Centre was established together with the World Bank and a new data transformation strategy was issued in 2019 to help inform and drive these efforts.\n\nAs the decade drew to a close, the Global Refugee Forum marked a pivotal moment.\n\nIt was the largest-ever gathering on refugee matters, building on many months of consultations and bringing together over 3,000 participants from diverse backgrounds. It helped showcase what had been achieved through the application of the Comprehensive Refugee Response model and generated some 1,400 pledges across a broad range of areas. Some are already being operationalized, or will be very shortly, while others will take more time, requiring legislative changes, new instruments, or resources to support their implementation.\n\nLooking ahead to the decade to come,\n\nI believe that in the Global Compact we have a powerful tool, born of a narrative of possibility and charting a measurable, practical way forward. I hope that the\n\nCompact, and the Global Refugee Forum, can provide a springboard for collective action, inspiring and driving our work over the next decade and beyond, and demonstrating in practical and concrete ways why international cooperation remains essential in addressing forced displacement and other shared global challenges, and how it can be made to work.\n\n© UNHCR/Santiago Escobar-Jaramillo\n\nThis decade of crisis and opportunity also called for changes in how UNHCR equipped itself to respond, with consequences for its budget, its presence around the world, and its staff and organizational culture.\n\n\"A generation of Rohingya children are still without access to the education they deserve.\"\n\nThe Special Envoy talks to refugees in Chakmarkul camp, Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh.\n\nUNHCR's Special Envoy, Angelina Jolie, continued her focus on major displacement situations and advocacy work for UNHCR throughout the year, carrying out field visits and other activities. Since joining in 2001, the Special Envoy has now conducted more than 65 field missions on behalf of UNHCR.\n\nShe heard humbling testimony from\n\nRohingya women, children and men who had endured lifetimes of persecution and discrimination, and urged continued support for those who have been displaced until such a time as refugees may return voluntarily, in safety and in dignity.\n\nIn early 2019, the Special Envoy visited\n\nBangladesh for a three-day mission to assess the humanitarian needs of Rohingya refugees and some of the more critical challenges faced in Cox's Bazar, observing as well the humanitarian response led jointly by the Government of Bangladesh and UNHCR. This was not the Special\n\nEnvoy's first mission to this crisis, having met with forcibly displaced Rohingya people during prior visits to Myanmar in 2015, and India in 2006.\n\nFocusing also on education, the Special\n\nEnvoy appealed strongly for access to formal education for refugee children during her visit with the Prime Minister in Dhaka, subsequently raising the matter through an exchange of letters with the Government.\n\nNearly a year later, Bangladesh announced steps to improve education programmes for Rohingya refugee children in the camps.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 13\n\nOV E R V I E W I K E Y D E V E LO P M E N T S I N 2 0 1 9\n\nOV E R V I E W I K E Y D E V E LO P M E N T S I N 2 0 1 9\n\nKey developments\n\nTHE GLOBAL COMPACT ON REFUGEES\n\nThe Global Compact on Refugees, affirmed by the UN General Assembly in December 2018, sets out arrangements for more equitable and predictable burden- and responsibility-sharing in response to large refugee situations. There was important progress throughout 2019 towards the Compact's four objectives, including through operational achievements flowing from comprehensive refugee responses; as well as the convening of the first Global Refugee Forum, one of the Compact's key arrangements for burden- and responsibility-sharing, and which collected some 1,400 pledges including more than 300 pledges made as part of the High-Level Segment on Statelessness in October 2019. Progress was also made in establishing other Compact arrangements for burden- and responsibility-sharing, as well as for follow-up and review.\n\n- 18 December 2019, Geneva, 16 at a glance\n\nRead more about the\n\nForum's outcomes\n\nOUTCOMES OF THE\n\nGLOBAL REFUGEE FORUM\n\n3,000+ participants\n\n1,400 pledges including 4 Heads of State/Government,\n\n70+ refugees, 90+ ministers and high-level government officials,\n\n130+ private sector participants,\n\n300+ other stakeholders accross 6 areas of focus: burden- and responsibility-sharing; education; jobs and livelihoods; energy and infrastructure; protection; and solutions\n\nPledges to ease pressures on host countries, including:\n\n$2.2 billion\n\n$2 billion pledged for the IDA18 refugee sub-window pledged from States and other actors and other stakeholders committed to support green energy and conservation efforts\n\n$250 million pledged from the private sector\n\nPledges to enhance refugee self-reliance, including:\n\n100+ pledges\n\n170+ pledges in support of inclusive national policies addressing jobs and livelihoods focused on expanding access to quality education\n\nProgress towards the objectives of the Global Compact in 2019\n\nObjective 1 | Easing pressure on host countries\n\nConsiderable new resources supporting additional instruments and programmes were made available for refugees and host communities by an increasing number of donors in 2019. While support envisaged under the Compact goes beyond funding alone, the Forum saw States and other stakeholders pledge over $2 billion for refugees and their hosts; with an additional $2.2 billion pledged by the World Bank\n\nGroup; and $1 billion from the Inter-American Development Bank. The Forum also saw progress in broadening the donor base, notably with the private sector pledging to contribute more than $250 million in funding, as well as for the direct employment of more than 15,000 refugees and other support. Leveraging the Compact, UNHCR worked closely with the OECD's Development\n\nAssistance Committee and its subsidiary body, the International Network on Conflict and Fragility (INCAF), to facilitate a new approach to financing refugee situations through the \"INCAF Common Position on supporting comprehensive responses in refugee situations\".\n\nThere was also increased support for national arrangements and coordinated refugee responses. States in the Americas participating in the regional comprehensive protection and solutions strategy (MIRPS) concluded a joint assessment and quantification of the investment needed to operationalize national action plans to address displacement, identifying both existing State resources and financing gaps to be met through international support.\n\nEthiopia's national arrangements-including the national comprehensive refugee response strategy, the latest in a series of progressive developments with regards to refugee rights-have attracted some\n\n$1 billion in assistance from the international community. More generally, both at regional and national levels, government-led coordination mechanisms were consolidated in 2019, bringing together key ministries beyond refugee departments, supported by a broad range of stakeholders, in line with the Compact's multi-stakeholder approach.\n\nAs government-owned inclusive mechanisms, these arrangements are facilitating area-based responses for both refugees and their hosts that align with national planning priorities.\n\nGlobal Compact burden- and responsibility-sharing arrangements established in 2019\n\nThe working modalities of the Asylum Capacity Support Group were finalized in 2019, prior to its launch at the Forum. The Support Group can be activated at a State's request to assist its national authorities to strengthen or adapt their asylum systems.\n\nThree Support Platforms were launched at the Forum to reinforce existing regional refugee responses with more robust international support, including the MIRPS in the Americas, the Nairobi Process facilitated by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) in the East and Horn of Africa, and the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees (SSAR).\n\nGlobal Academic\n\nInterdisciplinary\n\nNetwork\n\nGLOBAL ACADEMIC\n\nNETWORK\n\nLinking academia, policy makers and practitioners in the field of forced displacement and statelessness\n\nThe Global Academic Interdisciplinary Network was launched to facilitate research, teaching, and scholarships relating to the Compact, including through support for refugee scholars and academics.\n\nPledges on solutions, including:\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\nThe Global Compact on Refugees (GCR) states that \"a global academic network on refugee, other forced displacement, and statelessness issues will be established, involving universities, academic alliances, and research institutions, together with\n\nUNHCR and other relevant stakeholders, to facilitate research, training and scholarship opportunities which result in specific deliverables in support of the objectives of the global compact.\" (GCR, paragraph 43)\n\nThe GCR Global Academic Network (GAN) is one of the GCR's proposed specific arrangements for burden and responsibility sharing.\n\nCORE OBJECTIVES\n\n180+ pledges\n\n120+ commitments focusing on achieving lasting solutions, including voluntary repatriation aimed at expanding third-country solutions\n\nThe \"Three Year (2019-2021) Strategy on Resettlement and Complementary Pathways\" commenced, with an ambitious blueprint for third-country solutions over the next ten years.\n\n1.

Broaden the geographical and thematic scope of disciplines and academics working on refugee and GCRrelated challenges and opportunities. unhcr.org\n\nPB\n\nThe launch of the World Bank-UNHCR Joint Data Center on Forced Displacement in October 2019 marked progress towards better data on host country and community needs.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 15\n\nObjective 2 | Enhancing refugee self-reliance\n\nProgress was made in supporting refugees to participate in the social and economic life of host countries notably through access to education. Building on good operational practices, at the Forum some 180 pledges were made on refugee education, including support from the international community for the inclusion of refugees in national systems. Uganda's \"Integrated education response plan for refugees and host communities\", for example, received matching pledges by several donors at the Forum. Pledges were also made to ensure recognition of refugee qualifications (Peru), provide access to financial services, as well as towards green energy and conservation in refugee-hosting areas, including through UNHCR's Clean Energy Challenge.\n\nIn addition, 2019 saw a strengthening of self-reliance by refugees and host communities. The \"Kampala declaration on jobs, livelihoods and self-reliance for refugees, returnees and host communities in the IGAD region\" (March 2019) explicitly recalled the Compact in its commitments to move beyond refugee camps and allow refugees access to work. Support for access to livelihoods was also advanced through\n\nForum pledges to ensure that refugees have the same conditions of access to the labour market as nationals, to provide business development support services and low-cost loans (African Entrepreneurship Collective,\n\nSweden, Grameen Crédit Agricole\n\nFoundation) or to create jobs for refugees (Qatar). Mexico and Germany pledged to strengthen the social, cultural and economic inclusion of refugees, asylum-seekers, IDPs and migrants in vulnerable situations in up to Mexican municipalities. In addition, 27 law 15 firms, bar associations, and corporations pledged to provide 125,000 pro bono hours to support refugees' access to rights and protection, which are key to self-reliance, with 55 legal and community empowerment organizations pledging also to collaborate in this initiative.\n\nObjective 3 | Expanding access to third country solutions\n\nSteps were taken to support refugees in need to have access to resettlement opportunities in an increasing number of countries. Pursuant to the Three-Year\n\nStrategy almost 80 pledges were made at the Forum, with the European Union announcing the collective commitment by its Member States to resettle\n\n30,000 refugees in 2020, and more than\n\nStates making individual resettlement 20 commitments. Countries that are part of the\n\nGlobal Refugee Sponsorship Initiative States\n\nNetwork issued a joint ministerial statement noting their expansion of and support for community-based refugee sponsorship programmes.\n\nBuilding on existing progress prior to the\n\nCompact, States and other stakeholders also stepped up commitments relating to complementary pathways for admission.\n\nMexico pledged to facilitate student visas for refugees identified for the Habesha scholarship programme, and Norway pledged to reduce the fee for family reunification for recognized refugees. World University\n\nService of Canada and the ICU Japan\n\nFoundation committed to provide third-country scholarships for refugees, and Talent Beyond Boundaries and more than 25 companies jointly pledged to consider refugees as candidates when hiring internationally.\n\nObjective 4 | Supporting conditions in countries of origin for return in safety and dignity\n\nEstablishment of follow-up and review mechanisms under the\n\nGlobal Compact\n\nResources were made available to support the sustainable reintegration of returning refugees by an increasing number of donorS in 2019. At the Forum, over 400 pledges were made to use political and financial resources to address root causes, create conditions that enable refugees to return home voluntarily, and to help them rebuild their countries. The World Bank Group created a funding sub-window under its\n\nInternational Development Association of $2.5 billion to boost the private sector and create jobs in countries affected by fragility, conflict and violence, including many refugee countries of origin.\n\nMechanisms to ensure follow-up and review of the Compact and to assess progress towards the achievement of its objectives were established in 2019. These include:\n\nProgress was also made to enable refugees to return and reintegrate, socially and economically, in 2019. Leveraging the\n\nCompact, in the Central African Republic,\n\nIraq, Myanmar and Somalia, UNHCR worked with partners such as UNDP and\n\nUN-Habitat to remove obstacles for future return, including through increased access to justice, employment and basic services, as well housing, land and property. In\n\nAfghanistan, the launch of the Compact support platform for the SSAR facilitated\n\nUNHCR's efforts to link humanitarian interventions to development programming in 15 priority areas. At the Forum, 10 countries of origin pledged to work to create conditions for voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable returns, including through conflict resolution, rule of law and peacebuilding.\n\n• A Global Compact indicator framework containing 15 indicators to support its periodic review and strengthen the availability of global data structured around its four objectives. The first report on the Compact's indicators will be presented at the 2021 High-Level Officials' Meeting.\n\n• Ongoing coordination by UNHCR of a process to measure the impact of hosting, protecting and assisting refugees and to capture the costs and contributions, particularly of refugee-hosting States.\n\n• A pledges and contributions tracking dashboard as part of the Compact's digital platform, recording all pledges and good practices from the Forum that will be used to monitor implementation.\n\nGCR pledges and contributions dashboard\n\n(For more details on UNHCR's work on objectives 2, 3 and 4, see Building better futures.)\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 17\n\nSTRENGTHENING UNHCR\n\n© UNHCR/Claire Thomas allocation framework, consolidation of regional asset management boards, and committees on contracts supported by greater authority. Devolution of further authority to bureaux and country operations to recruit and manage personnel was completed, as was the creation of technical positions in the field such as dedicated regional data analysis teams.\n\nStrengthening risk management and operational integrity\n\nRisk management\n\nUmar Khan, 65, an Afghan returnee from Pakistan, collects water from a solar-operated well near his home in Tarakhail Daag, near Kabul. Before the well was built with UNHCR's support, Umar had to walk far to collect water from a well near the main road or buy it from a water tanker.\n\nThe year saw the completion of the first phase of reforms to strengthen UNHCR and its capacity to operate in a new decade, including decentralization and regionalization; reinforcing risk management and operational integrity; and partnerships. These reforms were driven by the organization's catalytic and supportive role in the Global Compact on Refugees; the need to better link humanitarian responses with development approaches (including through the United\n\nNations development system reform process); and the quest for more accountability, effectiveness and efficiency by the\n\nUnited Nations and other humanitarian actors, exemplified by the Grand Bargain.\n\nStrengthening the field: decentralization and regionalization\n\nAs of 31 December 2019, the seven regional bureaux had moved out of Headquarters into their respective regions.\n\nThis was the first step in shifting capacities and authorities closer to field operations in order to improve the level and quality of support, monitoring and oversight. NGO consultations were also regionalized with events in Amman and in Pretoria, a first under the new structure.\n\nKey internal processes to support the decentralized structure were also finalized, such as the revision of the resource\n\nBy the end of 2019, the \"Risk management 2.0 initiative\" (2018-2020) had resulted in the establishment of a risk management network across the organization including senior risk management and compliance advisors in the regional bureaux, and a combination of country-based risk advisors, roving advisors and/or training for in-country focal points. Risk management positions increased from three in 2017 to 30 at the end of 2019, and over 2,500 staff were e-trained in risk management and 600 risk focal points received face-to-face training.\n\nStaffin partner organizations were also trained. UNHCR's strategic risk register was updated, and all UNHCR operations and Headquarters entities carried out a mandatory annual risk assessment.\n\nThese steps improved the quality of available risk information and identification of risk mitigation measures to support future planning and decision-making.\n\nWith 2019 the midpoint of the \"Risk management 2.0\" initiative, UNHCR commissioned an independent review of its enterprise risk management (ERM) maturity and progress. The review found the system met the standard for an \"established\" function as set by the UN High-Level\n\nCommittee on Management risk maturity model, with defined, documented and standardized ERM processes in place with good organizational coverage.\n\nA plan of action was implemented to respond to the recommendations made through the maturity review and benchmarking exercise. UNHCR also participated in the inter-agency working group on risk management under the\n\nHigh-Level Committee to ensure a harmonized approach to risk management within the United Nations system.\n\nOversight and investigations\n\nTwo new frameworks strengthened\n\nUNHCR's integrity measures including independent oversight and investigations.\n\nThe \"Policy on independent oversight\" and the \"Administrative instruction on conducting investigations in UNHCR\" entered into force on 1 January 2020.\n\nAt the end of 2019, the Investigation\n\nService of the Inspector General's Office had a presence in Amman, Bangkok,\n\nNairobi and Pretoria, and the number of complaints relating to misconduct reached 1,200.\n\nThe increase was attributable to the strengthening of the Investigation Service through the professionalization of its workforce; strong messaging on integrity and the promotion of a \"speak up\" culture from executive management; the impact of the \"Risk management 2.0 initiative\" and the establishment of senior risk advisors in key operations; and mandatory training on integrity matters. The top three misconduct categories for complaints in 2019 included fraud with financial implications, sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA), and refugee status determination or resettlement fraud.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 19\n\nPreventing and responding to sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment\n\nThese remained key priorities as UNHCR continued to implement its 2018 strategy and action plan with a commitment to a victim and survivor-centred approach.\n\nUNHCR mapped good practices on protection from SEA in 29 operations, including in relation to leadership, reporting, refugee engagement, and case management. The network of focal points for protection from SEA increased from to 440, and they received online 350 and face-to-face technical support and training, including through an interactive platform. An independent evaluation of\n\nUNHCR's policies and procedures on prevention of and response to SEA was finalized in June 2019 and UNHCR began implementing the recommendations, many of which were in line with ongoing and planned initiatives.\n\nEfforts to encourage dialogue and empower UNHCR staffmembers to detect sexual misconduct, understand its impact and undertake prevention and response measures were intensified and expanded in 2019. These wide-ranging initiatives included: an informal exchange on sexual harassment led by the High Commissioner and livestreamed to all colleagues; an ideas challenge to better address sexual harassment within UNHCR, which generated 42 proposals, four of which were chosen for funding and showcased; the development of two innovative learning packages for UNHCR personnel, one each on SEA and sexual harassment; closer engagement with risk management experts to better identify and mitigate risks associated with sexual misconduct and the inclusion of this topic in all risk management training; and the piloting of a learning package for managers to support organizational change.\n\nThese were complemented by integrating responsibilities to combat sexual misconduct in managerial job descriptions as part of regionalization and increasing capacity to run sexual misconduct checks in the recruitment process.\n\nRecognizing the need to capitalize on inter-agency and other partnerships, the High Commissioner took up the role of IASC Champion on Protection from\n\nSexual Exploitation and Abuse and\n\nSexual Harassment in September 2019, focusing on the three pillars of bolstering prevention, expanding safe spaces, and promoting a respectful use of authority.\n\nThe Deputy High Commissioner took on the role of Interim Chair of the Chief\n\nExecutive Board's Task Force on\n\nAddressing Sexual Harassment, overseeing initiatives including the development of an investigator's manual on sexual harassment investigations, and the integration of a victim-centred approach in such investigations.\n\nAccountability to affected populations\n\nStrengthening UNHCR's accountability to people of concern remained a key pillar of its reform and transformation efforts. The framework for accountability to affected people (AAP) remained a point of reference, as part of the broader age, gender and diversity approach.\n\nUNHCR conducted a comprehensive analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in terms of accountability to affected populations in\n\nEgypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Jordan, Lebanon, Uganda, and Sudan. UNHCR also contributed to efforts to further accountability to affected people across the wider United\n\nNations system, including within the IASC and through workshops on leadership and accountability to affected people for resident coordinators, humanitarian coordinators, deputy humanitarian coordinators and OCHA heads of offices.\n\nStrengthening partnerships\n\nA multi-stakeholder and partnerships approach is a cornerstone of the Global\n\nCompact on Refugees, the High\n\nCommissioner's \"Strategic directions\n\n2017-2021\" and UNHCR's Grand Bargain commitments. The participation of a broad range of stakeholders including development and peace actors and the private sector at the Global Refugee Forum demonstrated this approach in practice (see the Global Compact Overview).\n\nIn 2019, UNHCR also commissioned a review of the Refugee Coordination Model, taking into account lessons learned in the five years of implementation to shape a new partnership approach. The main recommendation was the need to foster inter-agency and partnership skills across all levels in the organization.\n\nUNHCR supported the United Nations reform agenda as an active member of the\n\nChief Executives Board for Coordination, and the IASC. Within the IASC, UNHCR co-led the results group on accountability and inclusion, focusing on accountability to affected communities, localization, disability inclusion and risk communication.\n\nThe \"Guidelines on disability inclusion in humanitarian action\" were launched, with UNHCR steering the process through the IASC results group and leading the protection input.\n\nUNHCR participated in 23 out of 25 inter-agency humanitarian response plans and some 100 United Nations Development\n\nAssistance Frameworks or United Nations\n\nSustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks. Regional refugee response plans-often co-led by UNHCR and\n\nUNDP and collectively involving over partners-were coordinated for the 580\n\nBurundi, the Democratic Republic of the\n\nCongo, Nigeria, South Sudan and Syria situations. UNHCR and IOM continued to co-lead the regional Refugee and Migrant\n\nResponse Plan for the Venezuela situation, and coordinated the Bangladesh Joint\n\nResponse Plan for refugees from Myanmar with 48 partner agencies.\n\nSee the Refugee\n\nFunding Tracker for information on funding to RRPs\n\nCooperation continued with partners including FAO, ILO, IOM, OCHA,\n\nUN-Habitat, UNDP, UNICEF, WFP and\n\nWHO, with new memorandums of understanding signed with FAO and UN-Habitat. UNHCR was also a member of the executive committee of the United\n\nNations Network on Migration, coordinated by IOM, to ensure UN system-wide support to States in implementing the Global\n\nCompact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. Collaboration between UNHCR and the World Bank Group was furthered with the establishment of a Joint Data Centre, which will improve the collection and analysis of population and socioeconomic data on people of concern and host communities.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 21\n\nNUMBERS OF PARTNERS AND EXPENDITURE | 2019\n\nEXPENDITURE ON PARTNERS BY RIGHTS GROUP | US D millions\n\nBasic needs and essential services\n\nFair protection processes and documentation\n\nLogistics and operations support\n\nSecurity from violence and exploitation $1.376 billion\n\nTotal funds entrusted to 1,126 partners\n\nHeadquarters and regional support\n\nNGO partners $607.5 million\n\nLeadership, coordination and partnerships\n\nDurable solutions\n\nUNHCR reached its Grand Bargain commitment of providing 25% of its programme expenditures through local and national responders, up from 18% in 2015. Some $752.6 million was provided to 915 local and national responders, including $575 million to 709 NGO partners, the highest number of local and national partners recorded. Overall, UNHCR disbursed some $1.376 billion to 1,126 partners, many of them working to provide lifesaving protection and assistance in some of the world's most difficult or dangerous humanitarian environments.

With almost all local NGO partners benefitting from the new arrangement by the end of 2019, full compliance is due by 2021. A guidance handbook was released for partners on engaging and working with UNHCR.\n\nUNHCR operations were able to enter into multi-year partnership agreements (with or without having multi-year funding), and 34 such agreements were in place at the end of 2019.\n\nUNHCR's annual consultations with\n\nNGOs took place in July 2019, attended by 500 delegates from some 300 civil society organizations working in more than countries, and focused on the theme 80 of \"working together better\". The NGO\n\nInnovation Award was given to the Xavier\n\nProject (community-led learning) for connectivity, to Video Games Without\n\nBorders (for making literacy accessible), and to Laboratorio 53 ONLUS (for soundwalks bringing together refugees and local communities in Rome).\n\nThe implementation of Multi-year, multi partner strategies in 22 operations* enabled UNHCR to continue applying comprehensive responses at country level, bringing comparative advantages to resolve protection and solution challenges in a sustainable way for people of concern, including helping bring humanitarian and development actors closer together.\n\nLessons learnt have been integral for the ongoing renewal of UNHCR's results-based management (RBM) approach. Within a wide-ranging set of reforms and innovations, the new RBM approach will incorporate key changes in operations management processes. These include empowering UNHCR's field operations to develop, implement and monitor multi-year, context-appropriate protection and solution strategies and plans for UNHCR and\n\n(implementing) partners' responses, focusing on joint results for outcomes and impacts.\n\n* Algeria, Brazil,\n\nCameroon, Chad,\n\nColombia, Costa Rica,\n\nDjibouti, Ghana,\n\nEthiopia, Ecuador,\n\nKenya, Malawi, Mali,\n\nMauritania, Mexico,\n\nNiger, Rwanda,\n\nSenegal, Uganda,\n\nUkraine, the United\n\nRepublic of Tanzania and the Regional\n\nOffice for Northern\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 23\n\nUNHCR's ENGAGEMENT IN SITUATIONS OF INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT\n\n© UNHCR/Mysa Khalaf\n\nA grandmother and her grandchild receive humanitarian assistance at Rukban, in the Syrian Arab Republic (Syria).\n\nFor more information on internal displacement and related trends, see Chapter 3 of the 2019 Global Trends report.\n\nGLOBAL\n\nTRENDS\n\nFORCED\n\nDISPLACEMENT\n\nIN 2019\n\nThere were 43.5 million people internally displaced worldwide in 2019, fleeing violence, armed conflict, and human rights violations. There were 10.8 million new displacements associated with conflict, violence and disasters across 148 countries and territories, mostly due to unresolved conflicts and a rise in communal violence.\n\nLooking back at 2019, the year saw a complex set of trends in internal displacement and a reinvigorated, stepped-up response from UNHCR.\n\nIntercommunal violence triggered massive internal displacement and, in some cases, spillover across international borders.\n\nThis was particularly the case in the Sahel, with vulnerable populations in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger forced into flight. UNHCR activated an internal L2 emergency declaration in Burkina Faso and stepped up emergency preparedness in Mali and Niger. In the Democratic Republic of the\n\nCongo (DRC), violence in the North and\n\nSouth Kivu and Ituri Provinces saw an\n\nL3 emergency declared for the ensuing large-scale internal displacement.\n\nFragmented international peace efforts contributed to the continuation of internal displacement. Countries such as\n\nAfghanistan, Libya, Syria, and Yemen were cases in point. Alongside operational delivery, UNHCR enhanced advocacy for the protection of civilians, humanitarian access and principled humanitarian action through engagement with key stakeholders in relevant regional and international political fora.\n\nMajor natural disasters, such as Cyclone\n\nIdai in Mozambique and neighbouring countries, and slow-onset climate change drove significant internal displacement.\n\nUNHCR led the inter-agency protection response in Mozambique, providing timely information and analysis to inform the wider humanitarian response, targeted assistance to IDPs, and support to authorities. Climate change contributed to worse, and more frequent, seasonal droughts and flooding, with resulting internal displacement in countries such as Afghanistan, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Yemen.

UNHCR provided 123 days of capacity-building mission support to\n\nBurkina Faso, Ethiopia, Jordan and Sudan and 260 days of cluster coordination, information management and camp management support missions to the\n\nBurkina Faso, Chad, Colombia, the DRC,\n\nNigeria, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) and Yemen, with a focus on the 14 (out of\n\n23) activated country-level CCCM clusters and cluster-like mechanisms co-led by UNHCR.\n\nTo build the capacity of field protection clusters and protection actors, the GPC organized a training of trainers on law and policy on internal displacement with participants from the DRC, Equatorial 19\n\nGuinea, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe. The GPC Task Team on\n\nAnti-Trafficking also conducted workshops with protection actors in Nigeria, Myanmar,\n\nSouth Sudan, Switzerland and Ukraine to sensitize responders on integrating anti-trafficking action into protection work.\n\nIn order to understand protection challenges and contribute to future guidance, the GPC convened two thematic roundtables with participants on the \"Use of data to promote 80 age, gender and diversity mainstreaming\" and on \"Operating in violent extremism and counter terrorism environments\". In addition to the roundtables, three webinars with\n\n1,114 participants were organized on \"climate preparedness and community-based protection\", \"coordination and collaboration with the GPC\", and \"the future of protection in the humanitarian, development, peace and security nexus\".\n\nMany multi-sectoral humanitarian interventions are implemented in environments with limited access, and in small and informal sites where IDPs were able to find some safety. Such environments are challenging for the coordination of services and interventions. Based on field input and lessons learned, the Cluster developed guidance on management and coordination of collective settings through\n\n© UNHCR/Marta Iwanek\n\nUNHCR and OCHA co-chaired the\n\n20th anniversary of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement (GP20)\n\nInitiative-a multi-stakeholder effort to galvanize and intensify collaborative action by States, UN agencies, NGOs, national human rights institutions and civil society to address the challenge of internal displacement. The co-chairs fostered dialogue and collective action on internal displacement with States, particularly in the\n\nECOWAS and IGAD regions, supported the development and implementation of laws on internal displacement in El Salvador,\n\nEthiopia, Niger and South Sudan, and advocated the ratification of the Kampala Convention in Somalia and South Sudan.\n\nGP20 supported UNHCR's work in Colombia,\n\nEthiopia, Georgia, Kosovo (S/RES/1244 (1999)) and Ukraine to advance solutions for IDPs, and with the Central African Republic for a more harmonized approach to the collection and use of data on internal displacement.\n\nGlobal Protection\n\nCluster website a mobile area-based approach supported by a volume of case studies. The guidance has been already applied in Somalia and Yemen.\n\nGlobal CCCM\n\nWith over a million IDPs living in hundreds of makeshift camp-like locations across\n\nYemen, the delivery of humanitarian assistance was sporadic, unequal, and at times ineffective. To address this, UNHCR separated CCCM from the merged\n\nShelter/CCCM Cluster to create a stand-alone CCCM Cluster. Since then, it has effectively intervened in 143 informal settlements hosting over 123,000 IDPs, focusing on identification of needs, community engagement and leadership of projects, and maintenance of the camps infrastructure.\n\nSite-specific and population data/ information management systems are vital for the CCCM Cluster to profile displaced populations, monitor services and facilitate the interventions of other clusters. A partnership with CartONG allowed CCCM clusters in Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia, and Syria\n\n(cross-border) to improve visual representation and management of geographical and site monitoring data, enhancing evidence-based response.\n\nClearing landmines in Ukraine, one careful step at a time\n\nWith nearly 734,000 people internally displaced,\n\nUkraine is one of the most mine-infected countries in the world.\n\nThe most severely-mined areas are those near or along the contact line, where civilians are most at risk.\n\nCoordinated by the UNHCR-led Protection Cluster, the HALO\n\nTrust, a British demining charity, is helping to clear these landmines. Mines are not the only threat, however. More support is needed for mine victims and their families, including long-term medical care, rehabilitation and psychosocial support.\n\n\"I'm happy to be reducing the chance of deaths of both adults and children.

UNHCR led 15 clusters, thereby contributing to reaching about\n\n70% of people targeted by shelter interventions, and the GSC support team provided 503 mission support days and 697 days of remote support (55% by\n\nUNHCR), including to the newly-established clusters in Burkina Faso and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\n\nWith the shelter sector only 28% funded in 2019-despite acknowledgment that lack of access to shelter has broader impacts on affected populations' health, education, and livelihoods, and increases their vulnerability to protection risks-\n\nUNHCR-led clusters innovated in designing and implementing activities to deliver efficient and effective responses.\n\nFor example, in Iraq, working with local partners the Shelter Cluster promoted solutions-oriented shelter responses while also addressing emergency needs.\n\nGuidelines were produced on rehabilitation of war-damaged buildings while delivering cash, combined with in-kind material assistance and technical support.\n\nThis resulted in a cost-effective and customized response that was more relevant to the diverse shelter needs of the affected population.\n\nCLIMATE ACTION IN 2019\n\n© UNHCR/Elizabeth Stuart\n\nGlobal Shelter Cluster\n\n(co-led with IFRC)\n\nElsewhere, the Somalia Shelter Cluster developed guidance on the distribution of NFI kits, harmonizing both the process and kit contents to ensure equality and consistency of implementation approaches and technical standards, while ensuring a more efficient use of limited resources.\n\nIn the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the complex needs and implementation modalities required GSC support to establish a national coordination mechanism. With energy identified as a pressing need, the Cluster provided technical support to partners on renewable and alternative energy sources for shelter, health, and education infrastructures.\n\nCapacity-building activities were carried out with local partners to increase access to populations living in remote locations.\n\nCommunity members take advantage of a lowering of flood waters to run errands in Maban county, South Sudan. Three days later, this road was completely impassable.\n\nIn 2019 disasters triggered 24.9 million new displacements (IDMC). This is the highest figure recorded since 2012 and nearly three times the number of displacements caused by conflict and violence. Global trends are likely to see disasters and environmental degradation as increasing contributors to global displacement-either as direct causes or threat multipliers. the impacts of climate change on certain regions may also hamper, or even rule out, possibilities for voluntary return.\n\nPeople of concern to UNHCR are on the frontlines of climate change, with refugees and IDPs often hosted in \"climate hotspots\" where they are exposed to the risk of secondary or multiple displacement due to disasters linked to natural hazards and the effects of climate change. Furthermore,\n\nIn line with its protection mandate and the analysis that disasters are expected to increase due to global warming, both in frequency and intensity, in 2019 UNHCR continued its work on legal and normative developments on international protection for people displaced in the context of\n\nClimate change and its effects on how and when people are displaced is thus of importance to UNHCR, with both legal and operational relevance to its work, spanning preparedness, to emergency response, to solutions.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 29\n\nUNHCR also turned its attention to mitigating its own environmental footprint, scaling up its contribution to UN-wide sustainability targets by better monitoring its carbon emissions. In 2019, 100 UNHCR offices participated in the environmental inventory, which covered emissions of greenhouse gases, waste generation and water use-up from 10 in 2018-thus enabling a better estimation of the whole organization's emissions. UNHCR procured\n\nCertified Emission Reductions from two wind power projects in India to offset all its emissions for 2019, making it carbon neutral and fully compliant with the UN Climate Neutral Strategy.\n\nUNHCR's revised IDP Policy reaffirms that in countries prone to displacement,\n\nUNHCR will participate in inter-agency emergency preparedness measures, and strengthen local and national capacity to prevent and mitigate displacement risks.\n\nUNHCR also affirmed its commitment to contribute to any inter-agency response to disaster-induced internal displacement, taking the lead on protection, whenever the criteria-outlined in UNHCR's IDP\n\nPolicy-are met, including in the context of displacement linked to environmental degradation and climate change.\n\nUNHCR worked to improve people of concern's access to sustainable and clean energy and bolster the environmental protection of refugee-hosting areas, launching the \"Global strategy for sustainable energy 2019-2024\" (see Building better futures).\n\nThe Strategy aims to ensure that the priority energy needs of people of concern for cooking, lighting and heating are safely and sustainably met, supporting both refugees and host communities.\n\nAt the Global Refugee Forum, the High\n\nCommissioner launched the Clean Energy\n\nChallenge, the aim of which is for \"All refugee\n\nLooking to a future in which UNHCR can anticipate and be better equipped for the challenges ahead, in October 2019 the\n\nHigh Commissioner appointed a Special Advisor on Climate Action. This position will provide strategic guidance, oversight and expertise to shape UNHCR's climate action agenda, and respond to the growing challenges and protection concerns posed by climate change. Moving forward, climate action at UNHCR will be approached in a way that facilitates collaboration, and supports development plans and host governments, both in addressing current needs and in preparing for the future.\n\nClimate action at UNHCR will build on the\n\n\"Global strategy for sustainable energy\" and UNHCR's role as cluster lead or co-lead in internal displacement situations.\n\nIn line with the Global Compact, UNHCR will support measures that assist those forcibly displaced by disasters and enable those in need of international protection to receive it, as well as address root causes, drivers and triggers of displacement.\n\nThe greening of Cox's Bazar the positive impacts of liquified petroleum gas distribution among refugee and host communities\n\nOnce heavily forested, Cox's Bazar has suffered over the years from deforestation as communities have cut wood for construction and cooking, with studies showing the forested area has declined by approximately 40% since the 1990s. With the arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing violence in Myanmar, the rate of deforestation greatly increased.\n\nTo counter this, since August 2018 UNHCR has been distributing an alternative fuel-liquefied petroleum gas\n\n(LPG)-and improved cooking stoves, reducing the need for refugees to gather firewood from the nearby forest.\n\nCurrently, over 107,000 refugee households within the camps are receiving LPG, and the results have been remarkable. According to a UNHCR-commissioned study, in just under a year and a half since LPG's distribution, there has been an 80% reduction of demand for firewood by Rohingya households in the camps. The impact of this initiative, as well as the work of partners and other reforestation efforts, is striking and visible.\n\n© UNHCR Bangladesh\n\nUNHCR was active in the State-led\n\nPlatform on Disaster Displacement and the Task Force on Displacement under the UN Framework Convention on Climate\n\nChange, at a time when both entities saw their mandate and workplans renewed.\n\nUNHCR co-organized or contributed to events where climate change and disaster displacement were key features, including with the African Union and at COP 25 in Madrid. UNHCR also worked to develop regional guidelines on human mobility in the context of climate change.\n\nDelivering through partnerships settlements and nearby host communities to have access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy by 2030\". climate change and disasters. It also raised awareness on displacement and related protection needs in global policy discussions.\n\nIn line with the objective of the Global Compact to ease pressure on host communities, the initiative was scaled up in 2019 to include vulnerable local families. UNHCR and IOM began providing LPG to local communities near the camps, with 10,700 local families receiving LPG in 2019. Similar reductions in the use of firewood have been observed.\n\nParallel efforts by members of the Energy and Environment Technical Working, in collaboration with the Bangladesh Forest Department, saw more than 300 hectares of land reforested in 2019 alone. This also contributes to disaster risk reduction through the stabilization of soil, which leads to a reduction in landslides.\n\nLPG's benefits go beyond easing pressure on forests. It has an impact on food habits and nutrition due to ease of cooking and reduces pollution in the kitchen. The spectrum of ingredients and food diversity has increased for all households using LPG and in terms of nutritional balance, LPG users are found to be consuming more vitamins, as their intake of vegetables has increased.\n\nHaving LPG at home means women and girls need not travel long distances to collect firewood, thus reducing the risk of sexual and gender-based violence. And children, who used to spend hours collecting firewood, now have more time for classes.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 31\n\nOV E R V I E W I G LO B A L S T R AT E G I C P R I O R I T I E S\n\nOV E R V I E W I G LO B A L S T R AT E G I C P R I O R I T I E S\n\nGLOBAL STRATEGIC\n\nPRIORITIES 2018-2019\n\nIntegrated\n\nRefugee Health\n\nInformation\n\nSystem\n\nThe Global Strategic Priorities (GSPs) for the 2018-2019 biennium set out areas targeted by UNHCR to enhance protection for people of concern and identify solutions for them. The GSPs are divided into two categories: operational priorities for field operations and support and management priorities for core organizational functions.\n\nThe operational priorities influence the development and implementation of country-level plans by field operations and take into account the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The support and management GSPs reflect UNHCR's\n\n2017-2021 Strategic Directions, as well as commitments made at the World\n\nHumanitarian Summit and under the Grand Bargain. In line with the Global Compact on\n\nRefugees, UNHCR continued strengthening a broad range of partnerships within the humanitarian and development fields and the private sector.\n\nUNHCR's operations collected and analysed programme implementation information and communicated progress and results through\n\nFocus, UNHCR's results-based management system, as well as through the organization's integrated refugee health information system.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS\n\nContinued efforts across core GSP areas prompted significant improvements in several areas. At the end of 2019, 149 States were party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, its 1967 Protocol, or both. The first Global Refugee Forum encouraged many States to address refugee protection in a more comprehensive manner. UNHCR-led efforts to reinforce collaboration aimed at addressing internal displacement, including through the improvement of legislation and national policies in Ethiopia, Mali, the Philippines, Somalia and the Syrian Arab Republic.\n\nAngola acceded to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, while Colombia and Malta acceded to the 1954 Convention. This brought to 94 the number of States party to the\n\nConvention, and 74 States to the 1961 1954\n\nConvention. Furthermore, the Kyrgyz Republic became the first country to resolve all known cases of statelessness on its territory, having granted nationality to 13,700 stateless persons over the last five years.\n\nUNHCR registered over 8.8 million refugees in its digital population registration and identity management ecosystem (PRIMES) and strengthened its identity management capacity to achieve a 38% expansion in coverage compared to 2018. Some\n\n15,200 refugee housing units (RHUs) were deployed to 15 operations with\n\n219,000 people of concern (including some 90,020 IDPs) living in them by year's end.\n\nUNHCR supported new and ongoing emergencies, dispatching $30 million-worth of emergency core relief items from seven global stockpiles to 23 emergency-affected countries. Approximately $650 million in cash assistance was distributed, an increase of 13% compared to 2018 and 50% compared to 2015. Of the cash provided by UNHCR, 95% was unrestricted in use.\n\nUNHCR launched the \"Refugee Education\n\n2030\" strategy, and supported the launch of the Tertiary Refugee Student Network, a global network of refugee students committed to enabling 15% of all refugee students to access higher education by 2030. Supporting community empowerment and self-reliance, UNHCR invested in the capacities and skills of people of concern. UNHCR expanded its MADE51 multi-stakeholder initiative to provide refugee artisans with access to international markets developing refugee-made product lines in 15 countries.\n\nCHALLENGES\n\nThroughout 2019, UNHCR staff and partners planned, budgeted, implemented and adjusted strategies tailored to their local context, applying those GSPs which were relevant, and reprioritizing in the face of unexpected developments. In some instances, reprioritization forced operations to address certain essential needs over others, due to limited availability of resources.\n\nThe main challenge, however, remained that of accommodating a comprehensive response within limited budgetary resources which, in 2019, left a 44% funding gap. and a rise in food insecurity in places such as Chad, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi and South Sudan. They also hampered progress achieved by both\n\nUNHCR and partners on the prevention of risk mitigation for and response to sexual and gender-based violence in emergencies and protracted situations, with challenges including lack of funding, limited access to justice for survivors, insecurity and limited and fragmented services in certain locations.\n\nThere were also constraints on UNHCR's work to promote solutions. In 2019,\n\n63,726 refugees referred by UNHCR were resettled to 29 countries, a modest increase from 2018 which surpassed the target of 60,000 set out in UNHCR's Three-Year Strategy. Still, this represents less than 5% of the 1.4 million refugees estimated to be in need of resettlement.\n\nAlthough other durable solutions, such as local integration or repatriation had some successes, none of them kept pace with needs, and in only in very few situations did conditions allow for voluntary return in safety and dignity.\n\nRefugee Education\n\n2030: A Strategy for Refugee\n\nInclusion\n\nREFUGEE\n\nEDUCATION\n\nA Strategy for\n\nRefugee Inclusion\n\nEDITION 2019\n\nThe Three Year\n\n(2019-2021)\n\nStrategy on\n\nComplementary\n\nPathways\n\nThe Three-Year Strategy (2019-2021) on Resettlement and\n\nComplementary Pathways\n\nJune 2019\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nDetailed reporting on UNHCR's achievements and challenges across all\n\nGSP areas in 2019 can be found in the\n\nGSP Progress Report, which 2019 is available on the Thematic page of the Global Focus website.\n\nLimited resources resulted in cuts across the range of planned services and activities.

69th session in October 2018, the\n\nExecutive Committee approved a revised budget of $8.591 billion based on updated assessed needs. The final budget of $8.636 billion represents the sum of the approved revised budget of $8.591 billion, two supplementary budgets of $107.4 million issued for new or worsening crises in Cameroon ($35.4 million) and the Venezuela situation ($72 million) and a budget reduction of $62.6 million.\n\nThe final budget of $8.636 billion comprised programmed activities of $8.159 billion\n\n(including management and administration costs at Headquarters, which were covered in part by the United Nations Regular Budget contribution); an operational reserve of $459.4 million; the \"new or additional activities - mandate-related\" reserve of $5.6 million; and the $12 million fund for Junior Professional Officers. When compared with the final 2018 budget of $8.220 billion, the final 2019 budget increased $415.5 million or 5%.\n\n| REVISED AND FINAL BUDGETS BY REGION AND PILLAR | 2019\n\nThe largest requirements under\n\nPillar 1 were in the Middle East and North Africa region for Lebanon\n\n($562 million) and Jordan ($372 million), in Africa for Uganda ($386 million) and\n\nEthiopia ($311 million), in Asia and the\n\nPacific for Bangladesh ($308 million) and in Europe for Turkey ($391 million) and Greece ($272 million).\n\nFinal budget $8.636 billion\n\nRevised budget $8.591 billion 79% | $6.780 billion 77% | $6.693 billion\n\n1% | $74 million 1% | $71.5 million\n\n6% | $553 million 7% | $581.7 million 14% | $1.184 billion 15% | $1.290 billion\n\nThe second largest component of programmed activities was Pillar 4\n\n(global IDP projects) at 15% of requirements.\n\nMajor operations were in the Middle East and North Africa region, namely Iraq\n\n($416 million) and the Syrian Arab Republic (Syria) ($318 million).\n\nRegionally, the largest requirements were in the Middle East and North Africa and the Africa regions, at $2.751 billion, or 34%, and $2.676 billion, or 33%, of requirements for programmed activities respectively. This reflected the continuing challenges of responding to protracted and overlapping crises in these two regions.\n\nPILLAR 1: REFUGEE PROGRAMME\n\n2,500\n\nPILLAR 2: STATELESS PROGRAMME\n\nMillions\n\nThe Executive Committee, at its 68th session in October 2017, approved an original global needs-based budget for 2019 of $7.352 billion.\n\nGlobally, Pillar 1 (global refugee programmes) was the largest component of the budget for programmed activities, at 77% of total requirements.\n\nBUDGET 2019\n\n2,000\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\nMiddle East Asia and the and\n\nPacific\n\nGlobal Headquarters\n\nPILLAR 4: IDP PROJECTS\n\nPILLAR 3: REINTEGRATION PROJECTS\n\n,000 1\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 37\n\nINCOME 2019\n\n| CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE TOP TEN DONORS | 2019\n\n| SOURCES OF INCOME | 2019\n\nAll other donors | 20% | $855.4 million\n\nGovernments and the European Union $3.660 billion $421.7 million\n\nUN pooled funding and\n\nIntergovernmental donors $91.8 million\n\n2% 1%\n\n$43.3 million UNHCR raised $4.174 billion, a record level. The assessed contribution of the\n\nUN Regular Budget accounted for a further $43.3 million, bringing total contributions to $4.217 billion. Voluntary contributions included $101 million acknowledged in for implementation in 2020 or beyond 2019 and excluded $78.4 million acknowledged in 2017 and 2018 for implementation in 2019. Write-offs of $1.3 million reduced funds available. Overall, this meant UNHCR had contributions of $4.193 billion available against budgetary needs.\n\nThe United States of America was the top donor to UNHCR, providing 41% of all voluntary contributions for 2019. The top three donors-the United States, the\n\nEuropean Union (EU) and Germany-provided 62% of all voluntary contributions received.\n\nThe top ten donors provided 80% of voluntary contributions, an increase from the 76% in 2018.\n\nSince 2010, on average the top ten donors have provided annually between 74-79% of UNHCR's voluntary contributions.\n\nIn the last ten years, UNHCR has benefited from increased support from a few donors-notably the United States, the European Union, and Germany-while seeing reductions from other top ten donors.\n\nNotable increases came from the United States ($117.1 million, 7% increase), the\n\nUnited Kingdom ($23 million, 23%),\n\nQatar ($12 million, 139%), Denmark ($9.6 million, 12%), Japan ($6.4 million, 5%), Ireland ($2.4 million, 15%), and Czechia ($2.2 million, 84%)\n\nUnited States of America 41% | $1.707 billion The Netherlands | 2% | $72.4 million Denmark | 2% | $91.6 million España con ACNUR | 2% | $92.4 million Norway | 2% | $94.3 million\n\nThe top ten donors provided $3.318 billion, or 80% of all voluntary contributions Japan | 3% | $126.5 million United Kingdom | 3% | $128.4 million Sweden | 3% | $142.6 million Germany | 9% | $390.5 million\n\nEuropean Union\n\n11% | $473 million\n\nIn 2019, Gulf Cooperation Council volatility had a major impact, with a total reduction of $72.3 million from the United Arab Emirates ($36 million,\n\n93% reduction from 2018), Kuwait ($23.4 million, 54% reduction), and Saudi Arabia ($13 million, 26% reduction).\n\nCanada also reduced its support by 18% ($13 million).\n\nThere were also significant declines in pooled funding, with contributions from the CERF and country-based pooled funds dropping $11.2 million (18%) and $9 million (36%) respectively.\n\nHowever, contributions from development funding sources of $133.9 million represented some 3% of voluntary contribution in 2019, remaining an important source of support to UNHCR.\n\nIn-kind contributions such as support for premises, provision of standby partners or supply of core relief items, came to $31.7 million, including $12.6 million from the private sector. This was an overall 12% drop compared to 2018.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 39\n\nFlexibility, timeliness and predictability At $1.257 billion, flexible funding-which comprises unearmarked and softly earmarked funding-represented 30% of voluntary contributions. This was $115.4 million less than 2018, when it represented 33% of voluntary contributions.\n\nDespite Grand Bargain commitments, the trend of increased earmarking continued, with a marked drop in softly earmarked contributions and continued increases in earmarking at the country level.\n\n| TOP TEN SOURCES OF FLEXIBLE FUNDS | 2019\n\nSweden 15% | 99.8 million\n\nAll other donors 30% | $195.4 million\n\nUNHCR received $659.5 million in unearmarked funding\n\n| LEVELS OF EARMARKING | 2012 - 2019\n\nDenmark 4% | $24.4 million\n\nJapan 4% | $25.7 million\n\nThe top ten donors of unearmarked funding provided $464.1 million, or 70% of all unearmarked funds\n\nJapan for UNHCR 4% | $28.7 million\n\n0%\n\nGermany 4% | $28.9 million\n\n30%\n\n40%\n\n60%\n\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 7% | $44.6 million\n\nNorway 7% | $44.5 million\n\nNetherlands 7% | $43.1 million\n\nPrivate donors in the Republic of Korea | 6% | $41.8 million\n\nEspaña con ACNUR\n\n13% | $83 million\n\n70%\n\n12% | $72.5 million\n\n100%\n\nUNO-Flüchtlingshilfe 4% $23.5 million\n\nAustralia for UNHCR\n\n3% $15 million\n\nUnearmarked funding, which is contributed without restrictions on its use, came to $659.5 million. This was 7% increase on\n\n2018's levels and comprised 16% of all voluntary contributions. Sweden continued to be the largest unearmarked donor ($99.8 million); notably, these funds are also predictable and multi-year. The private sector provided 37% of UNHCR's unearmarked funding, on par with 2018 levels.\n\nThree private donors made the top-ten donors of unearmarked funding: Espaňa con\n\nACNUR ($83 million), private donors in the Republic of Korea ($41.8) and Japan for UNHCR ($28.7 million).\n\nSoftly earmarked funding, which can be used across a range of countries and activities in a given region or situation, came to $597.2 million. This was a 21% drop compared to 2018, as the United States adjusted its earmarking classifications.\n\n63% | $377.7 million $597.2 million in softly earmarked funding\n\nThe top two donors provided $450.2 million, or 75% of all softly earmarked funds Sweden | 2% | $14.4 million Denmark | 2% | $11.3 million Finland | 1% | $8.3 million Norway | 1% | $8.2 million Japan | 1% | $8.1 million Canada | 1% | $8.1 million All other donors | 8% | $50.1 million\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 41\n\nHowever, the United States also provided\n\nUNHCR with a critical source of flexible funding through contributions to the\n\nOperational Reserve, with a record $93 million in 2019. These funds allowed\n\nUNHCR to meet critical needs in underfunded operations around the world such as\n\nBangladesh, the Central African Republic\n\n(CAR), the Democratic Republic of the\n\nCongo (DRC), Ecuador, Iraq, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, and Uganda.\n\nOn timeliness, more voluntary contributions were received prior to the start of the year, helping ensure continuity of services and building in more predictability.\n\nEven compared to 2018, availability of funds within the first quarter showed a marked increase in 2019.\n\nUNHCR raised $422 million from private donors, of which $242 million (57%) was unearmarked and $71 million (17%) softly earmarked. Around $305 million (72%) was raised from individuals (4% growth from 2018), and $117 million (28%) from corporations, foundations and high-net-worth individuals (9% decrease since 2018).\n\nNevertheless, UNHCR reached more than 2.4 million donors, of whom 1.4 million were regular donors providing monthly support. Its global network of private sector fundraising operations grew, with two new\n\nNational Partners in Argentina and the United Kingdom. As part of its strategy for diversification of income, UNHCR is now present in more than 30 countries.\n\nThe largest private sector contributions came from Europe ($186 million), followed by Asia and the Pacific ($122 million), the Middle East and North Africa ($61 million), the Americas ($52 million), and Africa ($391,000).\n\nIncome equaled that raised in 2018.\n\nGrowth stabilized in 2019 mainly because of a divisive political environment which translated into increased anti-refugee sentiment; a shift in public interest from refugee causes to climate action; and the negative impact of exchange rates.\n\n| TIMELINESS OF CONTRIBUTIONS | 2015 - 2019\n\nPrivate sector income\n\n| PSP CONTRIBUTIONS AND DONOR NUMBERS | 2013-2019\n\n3.0\n\n2.1 million 1.5\n\nSee Global\n\nFocus situation dashboards\n\nMulti-year funding is another measure of flexibility and predictability for UNHCR operations. It reduces the negative impact of income fluctuations throughout the year which can have knock-on effects across all areas of UNHCR operations, from emergency supply chains, staffing capabilities in the field, and core operations. UNHCR was able to draw from over $542 million in multi-year funding in 2019.\n\nOther positive developments to note included some donors reducing reporting requirements in line with Grand Bargain commitments. In particular, Germany accepted situation level reports, which were developed on Global Focus.\n\n1.9\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\nContributions | USD millions\n\n1st January 1.6\n\n2.4\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.5\n\nContributions\n\nNumber of donors | millions\n\nNumber of donors\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 43\n\nIn 2019, Qatari philanthropist H.E. Sheikh\n\nThani Bin Abdullah Bin Thani Al-Thani made the largest ever gift from an individual donor (see story below). The next two largest private sector donors were Qatar Charity with $10 million in support of the Rohingya,\n\nYemen and Iraq situations, and Japanese fashion retailer UNIQLO with a $5 million in-kind donation of clothing to displaced people in 13 countries.\n\nThe increasingly crucial role of the private sector in supporting refugees was demonstrated at the Global Refugee Forum, with over 100 companies and foundations attending and more than 30 private sector organizations such as Ingka Group,\n\nVodafone Foundation and LEGO Foundation announcing pledges worth more than $250 million.\n\nGlobal campaigns continued to support fundraising. The shelter campaign, Nobody\n\nLeft Outside, which started in 2016, was\n\nUNHCR's first global campaign to raise funds from private donors for one thematic area.\n\nThe campaign ended in 2019, exceeding its fundraising target of $25 million, and raising $3.4 million in 2019.\n\nPrivate donors provided timely support to UNHCR's response to refugee, natural disaster and internal displacement emergencies. Over $111.7 million was raised in mostly softly earmarked funding.\n\nImportant donations were received for the\n\nRohingya refugee situation in Bangladesh ($30.6 million), Yemen ($24 million), Syria ($17 million, including $2.5 million for the escalation of violence in north-east Syria in late 2019), the DRC ($8.3 million),\n\nSouth Sudan ($8 million), Somalia ($6.6 million), the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ($3.7 million) and Cyclone Idai in Southern Africa ($1.8 million).\n\nThe Ramadan campaign continued to grow, raising $3.8 million globally. UNHCR also successfully beta tested a new mobile application that enables refugees and donors to communicate directly and securely, as part of a fundraising campaign to raise funds for cash assistance.\n\nUNHCR launched the Refugee\n\nZakat Fund in 2019, a transparent and effective distributor, harnessing the power of zakat to transform the lives of refugees and IDPs.\n\nIn 2019, $43 million in zakat was received, including $35.2 million from the Thani Bin Abdullah Bin Thani\n\nAl-Thani Humanitarian Fund, $4 million from Qatar Charity, and $3.51 million from individuals through the Fund's digital platform.\n\nZakat supported more than 1 million beneficiaries in Yemen, Bangladesh, Egypt, Iraq,\n\nJordan, Lebanon, Malaysia, and Mauritania, and UNHCR aims to establish partnerships with entities interested in expanding the impact of zakat by utilizing UNHCR's distribution network in hard-to-reach areas.\n\nUNHCR's Eminent Advocate supports displaced families through zakat H.E. Sheikh Thani Bin Abdullah Bin Thani Al-Thani contributed $35.2 million in support of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and displaced Yemenis in the form of zakat through UNHCR.\n\nThis was the largest contribution UNHCR has ever received from an individual donor and the first major zakat contribution of its kind. Approximately one million Rohingya refugees and Yemeni IDPs, returnees and members of host communities were supported through this generous contribution.\n\n© UNHCR/Susan Hopper\n\nIslamic philanthropy in focus\n\nUNHCR's National Partners\n\nIn times of rising xenophobia, the role of the National Partners is more important than ever before. In addition to funding for UNHCR's programmes, National\n\nPartners engaged and mobilized individual supporters, corporations and foundations and raised awareness through their extensive networks about what it means to be forcibly displaced. Two new National\n\nPartners were established in Argentina and the United Kingdom, bringing the number of committed supporters worldwide to over 1.4 million.\n\n| INCOME FROM NATIONAL PARTNERS | 2019\n\nUSA for UNHCR 15% | $33.9 million\n\n130,877 individual donors 12% | $27.6 million\n\n193,336 individual donors\n\nUK for UNHCR\n\nLess than 1% | $410,000\n\n7% | $16.2 million\n\n88,022 individual donors\n\nUNHCR's National Partners raised $223 million, or 53% of all income from\n\nNational Partners raised\n\n$151 million in unearmarked funding, accounting for 62% of all unearmarked funds raised by (inc. $7.3 million from decentralized authorities) 41% | $92.4 million\n\n723,843 individual donors\n\nSweden for UNHCR 10% | $22.7 million\n\n143,674 individual donors 13% | $29.8 million\n\n158,993 individual donors\n\nFundación ACNUR Comité Argentino\n\nLess than 1% | $34,440\n\n6,835 individual donors\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 45\n\nAustralia for UNHCR | Mobilizing and connecting corporates and leading women in Australia with refugee women and girls,\n\nAustralia for UNHCR supported the Office's maternal health programmes in the DRC for refugees from the CAR with its corporate partner, Teachers Health. A high-level women's donor mission to Uganda raised funds for local UNHCR programmes and launched the Australia for UNHCR-funded\n\nVocational Training Centre in Kyaka2 refugee settlement. Leading up to the\n\nGlobal Refugee Forum, its flagship World\n\nRefugee Day breakfast with 500 attendees highlighted how businesses can support resettled refugees through employment, training and mentoring. To empower refugee voices, Australia for UNHCR created a full tuition scholarship to give a talented refugee storyteller the opportunity to attend the Australian Film, Television and Radio School.\n\nEspaña con ACNUR (Spain) | Fundraising grew steadily due to a strong fundraising programme with regular donors, corporations, foundations and pioneering segments such as major and legacy donors; and to a communication and public engagement strategy bringing together civil society, boosting UNHCR's brand and keeping the refugee cause a top priority for Spanish people. The \"Loco de ACNUR\" (Crazy about UNHCR) brand campaign continued with a fresh look and feel and a multi-year development plan.\n\n(Argentina) | Inaugurated in 2019, the\n\nCommittee rolled out multiple donor recruitment channels and launched its first multichannel campaign \"Crazy not to help\" for World Refugee Day. A live TV concert was attended by some 2,000 people and accompanied by street advertising and telemarketing. Over 50 celebrities and influencers supported the campaign, which had a potential reach of 37 million people with 5 million impressions. The Committee recruited 6,700 donors, helped by a successful end-of-year winterization campaign, and received its first donation from a high-net-worth individual worth $14,000.\n\nJapan for UNHCR | Achieving the milestone of 104,709 monthly donors at year-end, the number of newly-acquired monthly donors grew by 57% compared to 2018.\n\nOne-offdonations exceeded expectations\n\n(37% over target), especially in reactivating lapsed donors, growing the middle donor programme (donors giving over\n\n$1,000 annually), and cultivating legacy gifting. Brand communication included media coverage of key events such as the lighting up in blue of 15 landmarks on\n\nWorld Refugee Day and re-branding of the film festival as UNHCR WILL2LIVE Cinema, which was mentioned by 131 media outlets.\n\nSweden for UNHCR | Taking the opportunity of its relationship with Roger Akelius (see below), new ways of communicating with donors and the general public were tested.\n\nIncome from other partnerships and high-net-worth individuals surpassed expectations, thanks to continued support from the Swedish Postcode Lottery,\n\nH&M Foundation, Lindex, IKEA Sweden and The World We Want Foundation, a new donor. In-house social media content production increased and surpassed targets (30 million views and 100,000 followers).\n\nSweden for UNHCR and Swedish billionaire find each other via newspaper ad\n\nEach year, Swedish billionaire Roger Akelius selects three humanitarian organizations for an end of year \"matching\" campaign. In 2019, UNHCR was not one of them. In response, Sweden for UNHCR published a full-page advertisement in a Swedish newspaper which read \"Unfortunately, we were not one of the selected organizations. But we happen to know that there are other billionaires in Sweden\". Mr. Akelius replied with an ad saying, \"I already have three relationships. 190\n\nBut if you don't find a better partner, let me try\". The light-hearted response resulted in Mr. Akelius matching Sweden for UNHCR's 2019 Christmas campaign. The matching received extensive media attention and played a key role in the outstanding increase of one-offincome in late 2019-a 66% increase compared to 2018.\n\nUNO-Flüchtlingshilfe (Germany) | Putting strong emphasis on acquiring one-off and regular donors, donations from individuals increased thanks to extended programmes to retain donors and multi-channel donor communications. For regular donors, a welcome cycle (including the innovative refugee story series \"Between Lives\") was implemented and steps taken to build a personalized donor engagement strategy.\n\nSuccessful mailing appeals were combined with several telemarketing campaigns to convert existing one-offdonors into regular supporters. Campaigns to reactivate lapsed donors showed very promising results.\n\nStrong progress was also made in terms of legacy fundraising.\n\nUSA for UNHCR | Realizing growth among its most valuable donor segments and enhancing engagement on many fronts, both gift value and retention improved among its most loyal donors (43,732 individuals who have given for two or more years consecutively), each of whom donated over $348 monthly. Efforts to maintain strategic partnerships led to $3.3 million in funding from Latter-Day Saints Charities, and ongoing financial and in-kind support from Microsoft, UPS Foundation, Google, Nike and others.

Regardless of status,\n\nVenezuelans displaced abroad require protection against forced returns, and access to basic services. UNHCR and IOM work together with this population by leading the Regional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform, which is aimed at strengthening protection and consistent responses across the region in line with human rights standards..\n\n(1)\n\n*\n\n3,582,203\n\n33,351,734\n\n15,650,382\n\n9,505,943\n\n12,085,455\n\n15,938,155\n\n86,531,669\n\nThe total statelessness figure includes 1,113,315 stateless persons of Rohingya ethnicity who are also counted as refugees, asylum-seekers or others of concern in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand or as IDPs in Myanmar. UNHCR's statistical reporting generally follows a methodology that reports only one legal status for each person of concern. However, due to the size of the stateless Rohingya population displaced from Myanmar, UNHCR considers it important to reflect the dual status of this population group as both displaced and stateless.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 69\n\nREGIONAL SUMMARIES I AFRICA\n\nREGIONAL SUMMARIES I AFRICA\n\n\"\n\nDespite development challenges and resource constraints, governments and communities in the region have continued to show exemplary solidarity in hosting forcibly displaced people. Ahead of the Global Refugee Forum, the region had embraced the Global\n\nCompact on Refugees through the implementation of the\n\nComprehensive Refugee Response Framework for greater social and economic inclusion of refugees and other people of concern.\n\n-Raouf Mazou, Former Director, Regional Bureau for Africa\n\n\"\n\nRefugee children from Cameroon sit with their belongings while their families wait to be relocated at the Agadom refugee settlement in Ogoja, Nigeria.\n\n© UNHCR/Will Swanson\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 71\n\nIn 2019, the number of uprooted people in sub-Saharan Africa reached record levels with 33.4 million people of concern to UNHCR-39% of the global total- including 6.3 million refugees-57% children-and 18.5 million IDPs.\n\nViolent extremism, intra-communal clashes, food insecurity and climate change fueled displacement, with UNHCR working in major refugee and internal displacement situations across the Sahel and Lake Chad\n\nBasin-in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and\n\nNigeria-as well as in Burundi, Cameroon, the Central African Republic (CAR), the\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Somalia and South Sudan, among others.\n\nAt 2.2 million people, the single largest refugee population remained the South\n\nSudanese, most of whom were hosted in Uganda. African countries largely maintained open-door asylum policies.\n\nUganda remained the country hosting the most refugees in Africa, with large refugee populations also in Ethiopia, Sudan, and Kenya.\n\nAlongside refugees, UNHCR also responded to the protection and assistance needs of millions of IDPs. The number of IDPs in\n\nWest and Central Africa reached 5 million by the end of the year, an increase of 30% compared to 2018. In the DRC, 520,000 more Congolese were displaced for a total of 5.01 million IDPs at the end of 2019, the world's third largest internally displaced population. Other significant IDP populations included Somalis (2.65 million) and South Sudanese (1.67 million).\n\nStepping up and renewing its commitments to IDPs, UNHCR's updated IDP Policy included priority initiatives targeting\n\nBurkina Faso, the DRC, Ethiopia, Sudan and South Sudan.\n\nUNHCR provided protection and assistance to the most vulnerable, supported social cohesion programmes, led protection, shelter and CCCM clusters as part of inter-agency responses, and prioritized services for close to 13,000 survivors of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV).\n\nOverall cash assistance was scaled-up, with $50.5 million distributed across the region in 2019, facilitating the socioeconomic inclusion of beneficiaries.\n\nThe Office worked with States and regional actors to strengthen asylum and refugee protection, including extensive work on a Sahel protection strategy. In South Africa, a UNHCR-initiated project was launched to address the backlog of around\n\n150,000 individuals in the Government's refugee status determination appeal process. UNHCR's Biometric Identity\n\nManagement System was rolled out in nine countries in West Africa, registering some 130,600 individuals. In line with the UNHCR data strategy, Data Identity Management and Analysis units were set up in the new bureaux.\n\nWith governments, UNHCR facilitated voluntary returns of refugees to\n\nBurundi (20,900), the CAR (12,400),\n\nChad (300), Côte d'Ivoire (3,200), the DRC (17,000), Mali (3,770) and Somalia (6,200).\n\nOn local integration of refugees, out-of-camp arrangements and residence and work permits were pursued. Notably, the Gambia and Guinea-Bissau granted citizenship to more than 5,000 refugees.\n\nTo eradicate statelessness, UNHCR facilitated birth registration and certificates, provided governments with technical support on removing gender discrimination from nationality laws and supported national action plans and high-level events advancing legal instruments. In Kenya, some 18,500 stateless persons will qualify for nationality under the citizenship law.\n\nThough resettlement quotas decreased significantly, available places served as a lifeline for 24,248 refugees who departed for resettlement in 2019, and 878 refugees were evacuated from Libya through the\n\nEmergency Transit Mechanism (ETM) in Niger. An ETM was also established in Rwanda following the Government's offer to the African Union to host up to 30,000 vulnerable refugees and asylum-seekers; some 300 people were evacuated there by the end of 2019.\n\nThe Comprehensive Refugee Response\n\nFramework was implemented in Chad,\n\nEthiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Somalia, Uganda and Zambia. In line with the Global\n\nCompact on Refugees, UNHCR engaged governments and partners to increase the socioeconomic inclusion of refugees, expanded partnerships with development actors such as the World Bank, and worked with governments to build inclusive national education strategies. In Ethiopia, refugees were granted greater freedom and access to local economies, while in\n\nMalawi they gained access to banking services stimulating micro-businesses.\n\nAt the Global Refugee Forum hundreds of pledges were made towards greater burden- and responsibility-sharing and the Intergovernmental Authority on\n\nDevelopment (IGAD) Support Platform was launched.\n\nDesigned to improve oversight and management of operations, three new bureaux were established towards the end of the year as part of UNHCR's process, in the East and Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes, West and Central Africa, and Southern Africa regions.\n\nAcross its operations, UNHCR maintained clear standards with respect to accountability, abuse of authority and power and protection from sexual harassment.\n\nThe region's budget in 2019 was $2.676 billion. Expenditure reached $1.321 billion, meaning a funding gap of 51%. Underfunding obliged UNHCR to prioritize lifesaving activities, thereby limiting the range of self-reliance interventions that were implemented.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 73\n\nAcross the continent, displacement-driven by conflict, inter-communal tensions, poverty, disease outbreaks, climate change and disasters-increased. However, despite rising numbers of people of concern-especially of internally displaced people-the continent's strong tradition of hospitality remained. States largely kept their borders open, and pledged extensively alongside many other actors at the Global Refugee Forum.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS AND KEY RESULTS IN AFRICA\n\n48,643\n\nM illion s\n\nREGISTRATION\n\nChild 6.2\n\n12,993\n\n4.4\n\n4.1\n\n3.1\n\nSGBV 0.1\n\n0.85\n\n0.3\n\n0.2 unaccompanied or separated children had a best interests assessment initiated or completed\n\nSGBV incidents reported for which survivors received psychological and social counselling\n\nMAJOR SITUATIONS OR OPERATIONS IN AFRICA IN 2019\n\nMALI\n\n164,500\n\nCENTRAL AFRICAN\n\nREPUBLIC\n\n844,400\n\nREFUGEES\n\nIndividual records migrated/registred in proGres v4\n\nCore relief items\n\nIndividual records biometrically registered in BIMS/IrisGuard\n\nHealth per person per day in refugee camps\n\n$46\n\nWASH $62.9\n\n$51.5\n\nBasic needs\n\nSeasonal grants\n\n49% of assisted population had access to a household latrine\n\n143,286 people of concern\n\n$40\n\n(per 1,000 people a month) litres of safe water available 18\n\n$50.5\n\n0.38 under-5 mortality rate\n\nLifesaving support\n\nU S D m i l l io ns\n\n44% of households lived in adequate dwellings\n\n917,985 children enrolled in primary education\n\nRESETTLEMENT DEPARTURES\n\nFROM THE REGION\n\n122,605 children enrolled in secondary education\n\nIndividuals\n\n6,368 people of concern received tertiary education scholarships\n\n45,000\n\n38,925\n\n37,500\n\n56,272 people of concern enrolled in vocational training\n\n24,248\n\n24,016\n\n22,500\n\n15,830\n\n19,327\n\nRETURNEES\n\nL2\n\nBURKINA FASO\n\n32,387 individuals submitted for resettlement in 2019 repatriation\n\nREFUGEE RETURNEES\n\n276,500\n\nIDP RETURNEES\n\nNIGER\n\nCHAD\n\nCHILDREN\n\nSUDAN\n\nNIGERIA\n\nCAMEROON\n\n285,000\n\nREFUGEES IN THE LAKE CHAD BASIN 2.3 million\n\nETHIOPIA\n\nCENTRAL\n\nAFRICAN REPUBLIC\n\nSOUTH\n\nSOMALIA\n\nUGANDA\n\nDEMOCRATIC\n\nKENYA\n\nREPUBLIC OF\n\nTHE CONGO RWANDA\n\nL3\n\n773,800\n\nBURUNDI\n\nSOMALI REFUGEES IN\n\nNEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES\n\nAND YEMEN 2.65 million\n\n54,300\n\nCAMEROONIAN REFUGEES IN NIGERIA\n\n670,400\n\nINTERNALLY DISPLACED\n\nMALAWI\n\nZIMBABWE\n\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\n\nOF THE CONGO\n\n6,200\n\nZAMBIA\n\n333,600\n\nMOZAMBIQUE\n\nBURUNDIAN REFUGEES IN\n\n33,300\n\n916,800\n\n21,200\n\n5.01 million 2.1 million\n\nSituation\n\nCRRF country\n\nIDP initiative\n\nOCHA figure OCHA figure.

While overall insecurity decreased, reported human rights violations continued and over 11,000 new Burundian refugees sought asylum in neighbouring countries and beyond.\n\nUNHCR and partners did not promote returns, however, 21,200 refugees made a free and informed choice to return voluntarily and UNHCR assisted with repatriation and reintegration support in Burundi, along with 19 partners through the Joint Refugee Return and Reintegration Plan.\n\nKEY RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS\n\n20,916 refugees assisted to voluntarily repatriate to Burundi\n\n42,865 Burundian refugee children enrolled in primary school in the United Republic of Tanzania\n\n3,626 Burundian refugee households received core relief items in the United Republic of\n\nTanzania\n\nIn line with the Burundi Regional Refugee Response Plan, which brought together over 35 partners,\n\nUNHCR provided humanitarian assistance and protection for Burundian refugees in the four main countries of asylum.\n\nCENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC\n\nDespite insecurity throughout the year, relative calm in parts of the country and the signing of tripartite agreements in 2019 allowed UNHCR to facilitate the voluntary return of over 12,400 Central African Republic (CAR) refugees from Cameroon, the Republic of the Congo and the DRC.\n\nUNHCR also provided protection for over 600,000 CAR refugees in neighbouring countries and pursued solutions in collaboration with development actors and host governments.\n\nIn the CAR, UNHCR led the Protection, Shelter and CCCM Clusters in support of over 687,000 IDPs through the rehabilitation of health and educational facilities; assistance in securing documentation and birth registration; livelihoods training; and the distribution of agriculture kits and tools. Collaboration with local authorities and key humanitarian and development partners was strengthened to facilitate the return and reintegration of IDPs.\n\nBy the end of 2019, over 51,000 Cameroonian refugees had fled to border areas of South-East Nigeria. With support from the Government of Nigeria,\n\nUNHCR relocated 8,041 refugees to Benue, Cross River and Taraba States, promoting an out-of-camp approach, and increasing its use of cash assistance to foster socioeconomic inclusion and strengthen the resilience of both Cameroonian refugees and host communities.\n\n12,592 IDP households received core relief items and shelter kits\n\n52,296 CAR refugee children enrolled in primary and secondary education in Cameroon and Chad\n\n98,000 identity documents issued to displaced populations and hosts in Burkina Faso\n\n2,936 refugee and IDP families assistance and shelter kits in western Niger\n\nThroughout northern Nigeria, especially around the Lake Chad Basin, people of concern and humanitarian workers alike were faced with mounting insecurity.\n\nThe situation in Katsina, Sokoto and Zamfara States in north-western Nigeria drove over 40,000 refugees to the Maradi region in southern Niger.\n\nIn South-East Nigeria, the number of Cameroonian refugees increased by 35%, reaching 51,700 by the end of 2019. UNHCR and partners provided emergency assistance such as multi-purpose cash grants, shelter and core relief items, and relocated over 8,000 refugees from border areas while undertaking biometric registration, protection monitoring and ensuring the provision of basic health care services to those with the most pressing needs.\n\n12,522 Nigerian IDP and refugee items in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria\n\n15,526 Nigerian refugee children were enrolled in primary and secondary education in Cameroon,\n\nChad and Niger\n\n7,350 IDP households received core relief items in Cameroon\n\n7,027 Cameroonian refugee children enrolled in primary and secondary education in Nigeria\n\n6,057 Cameroonian refugees received shelter support in Nigeria\n\nEfforts continued in what is one of the world's longest-running refugee situations to create an enabling environment for the reintegration of over 120,000 Somali refugee returnees who repatriated in previous years. The volatile security situation in Somalia however remained an impediment to safe return, with only 6,200 returnees in 2019.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of an ongoing state-building process, returnees and IDPs faced severe hunger, drought and ongoing insecurity. Funding shortfalls meant the majority of IDPs, and the 17,900 refugees hosted in Somalia, remained in need of urgent humanitarian assistance.\n\n20,500 Somali IDP households received cash grants\n\n46,886 Somali refugee children enrolled in primary education in\n\n16,459 Somali refugee households received core relief items in\n\nUNHCR's Special Envoy to the East and Horn of Africa played a key role in maintaining high-level political focus and support to the Somalia situation and prioritized education and jobs through the implementation of the Djibouti Declaration on Education and the Kampala Declaration on Livelihoods. Support was also mobilized from the private sector and the global Somali diaspora. UNHCR and partners provided capacity building to the Government of Somalia to implement comprehensive solutions for the 2.65 million IDPs in 2019.\n\n61,000 IDPs benefitted from multi-purpose cash assistance\n\n118,000 IDPs received core relief\n\n87,576 IDPs received shelter\n\nAs part of its humanitarian response, UNHCR provided shelter support; built schools, health centers and other community infrastructures; provided cash assistance; and responded to protection incidents.\n\nAs part of the CCCM coordination strategy, UNHCR strengthened the capacity of site management personnel and Government actors to ensure the protection of IDPs and proper site management.\n\nUNHCR also led advocacy efforts for the decongestion of the Institut Supérieur Pédagogique displacement site and the closure of the overcrowded General Hospital site in Bunia, Ituri Province. A new displacement site was opened in October 2019, where people were relocated to decongest other sites. UNHCR created and revitalized IDP committees to strengthen self-management in displacement sites.\n\nIn 2019, as part of the Regional Refugee Response Plan, UNHCR along with 57 partners provided critical protection and assistance to some\n\n916,800 Congolese refugees in seven neighbouring countries as well as in the wider Southern Africa region.\n\nDespite these factors and a shrinking humanitarian space, UNHCR and its partners scaled up assistance to a growing population of concern, notably in Burkina Faso. Seven clusters were activated, including the Protection and Shelter/NFI Clusters led by UNHCR. At the regional level and in coordination with the Governments of Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali,\n\nMauritania and Niger, UNHCR initiated the development of a Sahel protection strategy, to address sexual and gender-based violence and ensure continued access to education, while providing shelter assistance in an environmentally-conscious manner in a region particularly affected by climate change.\n\nThis strategy was to be launched in January 2020.\n\nIn North-Eastern Nigeria, over 2 million people were internally displaced in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe States by the end of 2019. There, UNHCR provided protection and assistance in support of the Government, leading the Protection, Shelter/NFI and CCCM Clusters, and with partners conducted some 2,472 monitoring missions to inform UNHCR's protection response in the region. A strong focus was placed on sexual and gender-based violence prevention and response, with more than 768 survivors receiving assistance, including psychosocial counselling and referrals to specialized services.\n\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO\n\nAlthough a peaceful transition of power followed the presidential elections in December 2018, the security and humanitarian situation continued to deteriorate, mainly in the east, in what is one of the most complex and long-standing humanitarian crises in Africa. Approximately 1.67 million people were newly displaced in 2019, despite Government efforts to promote returns for refugees, asylum-seekers and IDPs. Furthermore, Ebola and measles epidemics took more than 2,000 lives and 2,700 lives respectively.\n\nIn the second half of 2019, rising insecurity triggered forced displacement in the\n\nLiptako-Gourma area, where Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger share common borders. Violent extremism was a key driver of this multifaceted crisis, exacerbating pre-existing vulnerabilities such as weak governance, severe climate change, rapid demographic growth and scarce natural resources.\n\n12,400 refugees assisted to voluntarily return to the CAR\n\nAgainst a backdrop of deteriorating security, UNHCR and partners supported the Government of Cameroon in providing protection and assistance to over\n\n240,000 newly displaced IDPs in the south-western and north-western regions of Cameroon.\n\nSouth Sudan remained the largest refugee displacement situation in Africa, with over 2.2 million refugees recorded. While most parts of the country saw less armed conflict, the formation of the transitional Government was delayed and over 74,000 new South Sudanese refugees sought safety in neighbouring countries.\n\nAlthough UNHCR's regional intention survey highlighted that the majority of refugees did not have plans to return in the near future, nearly 100,000 South\n\nSudanese refugees returned spontaneously, of which 4,560 households were assisted with core relief items. A majority of those who returned are living in IDP-like situations, in addition to an already existing internally displaced population of 1.67 million, including some 190,000 IDPs living in Protection of Civilian sites. Over 38,700 South Sudanese IDP households received core relief items.\n\n181,297 South Sudanese refugee in Uganda\n\n64,610 South Sudanese refugee items in Ethiopia\n\n38,741 South Sudanese IDP\n\nIn line with the South Sudan Regional Refugee Response Plan, and working with 95 partners, UNHCR's humanitarian response focused on ensuring protection, providing lifesaving assistance and expanding opportunities for self-reliance.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 77\n\nKEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND IMPACT\n\nEAST AND HORN OF AFRICA AND THE GREAT LAKES\n\n© UNHCR/Eduardo Soteras Jalil Unaccompanied South Sudanese minors sit outside their house at Jewi refugee camp in Ethiopia.\n\nSafeguarding access to protection and asylum\n\nTelling the\n\nReal Story\n\nUNHCR and partners worked in support of governments hosting a total of 4.6 million refugees and asylum-seekers with the aim of maintaining open-door asylum policies.\n\nWhile the protection environment remained generally hospitable in 2019, there were concerning instances of forced return of refugees. UNHCR worked closely with\n\nStates to strengthen asylum institutions and refugee protection capacity, including those where the quality and accessibility of asylum procedures were deteriorating.\n\nAdvocacy interventions included engagement with the East African Community Chiefs of Refugee Management to develop a regional refugee management policy.\n\nA key development in UNHCR's response to mixed movements was the establishment in late 2019 in Rwanda of the Emergency Transit Mechanism. This followed an offer by the Government to the African Union to host up to 30,000 vulnerable refugees and asylum-seekers evacuated from detention centers and highly insecure conditions in Libya. By the end of 2019, more than evacuees had arrived in Rwanda, 300 with a range of options for durable solutions and complementary pathways being pursued, including a first group of resettlement departures to Sweden.\n\nAnother initiative was \"Telling the Real\n\nStory\", an information campaign designed to communicate with communities on the dangers of the perilous journeys across the Gulf of Aden and the Mediterranean.\n\nResponding with lifesaving assistance\n\nUNHCR's lifesaving support in the region focused on interventions in emergency preparedness, strengthening community-based protection, child protection, prevention and response to\n\nSGBV, shelter, water and sanitation, nutrition, education, livelihoods and energy conservation. The Office scaled up capacity-building activities on prevention and response to SGBV for UNHCR staff, government counterparts, partners and refugee communities in different country operations, with two regional and six national workshops organized. In collaboration with UNHCR's operational partner in Kenya, Population Council, additional technical assistance was provided to eight country operations implementing the SAUTI project, (SAUTI a Swahili word meaning VOICE-Violence\n\nPrevention and Response through\n\nInformation, Communication, and Evidence) with various strategies of preventing, mitigating and responding to SGBV.\n\nIn line with the objectives of the Global\n\nCompact on Refugees, UNHCR's overarching strategic objective in the region was to support socioeconomic inclusion and resilience for refugees living in camps and camp-like settlements (82%), urban areas (13%) and other rural out-of-camp settlements (5%). As many camps and settlements were in remote and underdeveloped areas, where resources, infrastructure and basic services were extremely limited, UNHCR and its humanitarian and development partners prioritized including refugees in national and local systems for basic service provision and renewing focus on sustainable energy, environmental protection and social cohesion.\n\nIn 2019, UNHCR spearheaded inter-agency efforts to scale up cash assistance where feasible, with approximately 5% of UNHCR's assistance in the region delivered through such interventions, a 3% increase compared to 2018. Multi-purpose cash for basic needs, livelihoods, repatriation and reintegration, education and shelter, as well as services for persons at heightened risk remained critical in support of self-reliance efforts.\n\nSeeking durable solutions for protracted refugee situations\n\nThe protracted Burundi, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan refugee situations saw little scope for comprehensive durable solutions.\n\nDespite constraints, UNHCR worked with governments to achieve more equitable responsibility-sharing and durable solutions where possible, promoting the self-reliance of refugees, returnees and host communities.\n\nA revitalized peace agreement created opportunities for the return of some displaced South Sudanese, while small-scale returns continued to Burundi, Somalia and Sudan. UNHCR supported 21,200 Burundian and 6,200 Somali refugees in the United\n\nRepublic of Tanzania and Kenya respectively to voluntarily repatriate.\n\nResilience was strengthened through the gradual inclusion of refugees in national development plans and national service delivery systems. Ethiopia adopted a progressive Refugee Proclamation in\n\nJanuary 2019, granting refugees greater freedom of movement and access to local economies. In Uganda, the largest refugee-hosting country in Africa, work commenced to include refugees in national and district development plans. In Somalia, a National Durable Solutions Secretariat was launched in October 2019 to coordinate solutions initiatives in 2020 and beyond.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 79\n\nRegional actors, in particular IGAD and the\n\nInternational Conference of the Great\n\nLakes Region (ICGLR) promoted multiple regional commitments in support of durable solutions. Several States pledged to create conditions conducive to return and local integration at the Global Refugee\n\nForum, which also saw the launch of the\n\nIGAD Support Platform, featuring a dedicated returns and reintegration pillar, aiming to galvanize additional support for\n\nMember States' efforts in rolling out more comprehensive responses to refugee situations.\n\nOpportunities for third-country resettlement were reduced in 2019, with 24,393 individuals submitted for resettlement in 2019, compared to 27,119 in 2018, an 11% decrease. Despite these challenges, over 18,700 individuals departed for resettlement in 2019, compared to only 15,388 in 2018.\n\nLarge-scale internal displacement continued in Ethiopia, Somalia,\n\nSouth Sudan and Sudan, cumulatively raising to 7.9 million the number of IDPs across these four countries. In line with\n\nUNHCR's IDP initiative, application of which was prioritized in Ethiopia, South Sudan and Sudan, areas of intervention for IDPs included community-based approaches to prevention, response and mitigation of the most urgent protection risks and needs, including engagement with relevant lead agencies to combat SGBV and promote child protection. In Ethiopia, UNHCR devised a new protection and solutions strategy in late 2019 to respond to internal displacement and adapted following new displacement as a result of inter-communal violence. Working with the Government and other stakeholders in support of the\n\nNational Durable Solutions Initiative,\n\nUNHCR initiated quick impact projects as part of an area-based assistance model and strengthened protection monitoring and analysis. In South Sudan, through the GP20 Initiative, IDPs were consulted on the development of the IDP law and\n\nUNHCR supported the internally displaced community to ensure a solutions-oriented approach for those returning.\n\nIntra-communal tensions, often exacerbated by disasters, continued to impede safe return and reintegration for many.\n\nOpportunities to pursue solutions for\n\nIDPs in the region were bolstered by\n\nSouth Sudan's accession and Somalia's ratification of the Kampala Convention.\n\nSomalia's Government adopted a national framework on IDPs and returnees, and similar national frameworks are being revised or will soon be adopted by other countries in the region.\n\nUNHCR's role leading the Protection\n\nClusters in Ethiopia, South Sudan, Somalia and Sudan was pivotal to addressing key issues such as access to housing, land and property.\n\nReducing and preventing\n\nIn preparation for the High-Level Segment on Statelessness (HLS), UNHCR co-convened a ministerial conference on the eradication of statelessness with the ICGLR Secretariat and the Government of Kenya. This landmark regional preparatory event allowed the\n\nICGLR Member States and key regional 12 bodies to deliver strong indicative pledges to end statelessness in their respective\n\nAt the HLS in October 2019, these indicative pledges were translated into formal commitments to eradicate 49 statelessness by Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda,\n\nSomalia, Uganda, and South Sudan, two key regional bodies (ICGLR and the AU\n\nCommission), and four NGOs from the region. Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan and\n\nUganda each committed to adopt national action plans to end statelessness by 2024 and the ICGLR Secretariat pledged to support the adoption of the consolidated action plan on the eradication of statelessness and steer the development of a regional policy on birth registration to prevent statelessness.\n\nThese commitments will pave the way for further concrete engagement in the region by States to identify, reduce and prevent statelessness for the four remaining years\n\n© UNHCR/Samuel Otieno\n\nEnsuring protection, assistance and solutions in internal displacement contexts of the #IBelong Campaign. This will include access to nationality for about\n\n18,500 stateless persons who qualify under the Citizenship Act in Kenya; accession to the statelessness conventions and reform of domestic law to incorporate safeguards against statelessness; and facilitated birth registration for those at risk of statelessness such as refugees and returnees.\n\nIn Sudan, a project that began in 2012 to support individuals of South Sudanese origin to acquire South Sudanese nationality documentation-in partnership with the South Sudanese Directorate of\n\nNationality, Passports and Immigration, and the South Sudanese Consulate in\n\nKhartoum-saw a total of 70,349 individuals acquiring their nationality documents in 2019.\n\nEnvironmentally-friendly, economically productive and user-friendly sanitation solutions for refugees\n\nIn 2019, UNHCR and the Bill and Melinda\n\nGates Foundation completed a four year Waste-to-Value Sanitation Solutions project in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe project explored sanitation technologies that can be used in difficult ground conditions and which capture the embodied energy or nutrients in human waste: transforming human waste into a commodity, such as fuel briquettes for cooking or a fertilizer for agro-forestry products.\n\nIn Kenya, the project was implemented together with the company Sanivation which provides container-based toilet systems and processes waste into a solid fuel product. The system ensures safely managed sanitation for households and reduces the land area required for sanitation facilities. The product created is a more economical, efficient and environmentally-friendly alternative to conventional charcoal which refugees use as fuel for cooking. In addition, the project has generated livelihood opportunities, with over 25 refugees and 8 members of the host community gaining employment opportunities as a result.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 81\n\nSOUTHERN AFRICA\n\n© UNHCR/Adrienne Surprenant and 18 by non-State actors-at the Global Refugee Forum.

In Malawi,\n\nUNHCR participated in the finalization of the Malawi migration policy which, once approved, will lead to the review of the\n\nRefugee Act, opening a discussion on lifting reservations to the 1951 Convention.\n\nIn South Africa, a UNHCR-initiated project was launched to address the backlog of around 150,000 individuals in the\n\nGovernment's refugee status determination (RSD) appeal process. In Zambia, UNHCR also continued to invest in RSD and refugee\n\nIn total, the Southern Africa region presented 87 pledges-69 by States\n\nIn 2019, UNHCR strengthened emergency preparedness and enhanced partnerships following cyclical emergencies in the DRC and large-scale displacements in Malawi,\n\nMozambique and Zimbabwe as a result of Tropical Cyclone Idai. As part of the collective UN system-wide response,\n\nUNHCR deployed emergency teams to the three affected countries, and swiftly airlifted shelter and core relief items from global stockpiles to assist vulnerable cyclone survivors.\n\nCash, along with other assistance and services anchored in national systems, was an integral element of UNHCR's protection and solutions strategy.\n\nOperations in South Africa and Zambia used cash as a vehicle for the financial inclusion of refugees. In South Africa,\n\nUNHCR and partners supported improved access to social grants for 316 refugees, and 1,049 refugees and asylum-seekers received cash assistance for food, transport, household and hygiene items, accommodation, shelter and funeral costs.\n\nIn areas where cash could not be distributed, UNHCR prioritized core relief times and shelter.\n\nIn the DRC, UNHCR provided 23,619 IDP households and vulnerable members of the local population with core relief item kits.\n\nUNHCR built 6,494 shelters and provided shelter assistance to 87,576 IDPs. UNHCR also built and rehabilitated shelters for\n\n5,777 Burundian refugees and assisted\n\nCentral African refugee and Congolese 112 host community households with relief items after flooding destroyed shelters, farmlands and basic social infrastructure.\n\nIn Malawi, with additional land granted by the Government for the expansion of\n\nDzaleka refugee camp, UNHCR constructed shelters for 320 families. In Mozambique,\n\nUNHCR conducted core relief item distributions of sanitary napkins and soap to women and girls of reproductive age. In the Republic of the Congo,\n\nUNHCR constructed 790 permanent and temporary shelters, 180 blocks of 300 latrines and showers and school class buildings to respond to the influx of\n\nCongolese asylum-seekers, and distributed essential household items to 2,000 families.\n\nPending the availability of durable solutions,\n\nUNHCR enhanced collaboration with development actors to bridge the gap between humanitarian and development efforts, and to ensure that refugees, particularly those living in poverty, could access livelihood opportunities.\n\nLivelihood interventions in the region, mainly in agriculture, enabled beneficiaries to increase their income and savings, and meet their basic needs such as food, education, health and shelter. In Malawi, 450 people of concern benefitted from the support provided to the poorest and most vulnerable refugee and host community households through the Graduation Approach. In\n\nAngola's Lóvua settlement, a comprehensive livelihood strategy was developed with WFP, with a focus on building refugee resilience and self-reliance. Under the strategy, the\n\nGovernment provided access to land and\n\nUNHCR supported 400 refugee farmers with seeds, farming tools and training. Elsewhere in the region, UNHCR's advocacy for access to land to help people of concern feed themselves in the short and medium term and become self-reliant in the longer term, had some success. In Zimbabwe, the\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 83\n\nGovernment allocated an additional\n\n25,000 hectares of land to refugees for agriculture, and during the Global Refugee\n\nForum, Governments such as Eswatini,\n\nNamibia and Zambia, all pledged to support refugee self-reliance through the provision of agricultural land.\n\nFollowing the signing of a tripartite agreement with the Governments of the\n\nDRC and the CAR, UNHCR facilitated the voluntary repatriation of over 3,000 refugees from the DRC to the CAR. Following the signing of a tripartite agreement between\n\nUNHCR, the DRC and Angola, over\n\n17,000 Congolese refugees were assisted to voluntarily return with cash assistance as part of their return package. In the Republic of the Congo, UNHCR facilitated the return of 6,216 refugees in safety and dignity to the CAR.\n\nThe Office also continued to advocate for resettlement opportunities. UNHCR submitted 3,861 cases and a total of\n\n1,342 resettlement departures took place to Australia, Canada, Finland, Sweden and the United States of America. However, resettlement is increasingly becoming an option only for a very limited number of the most vulnerable refugees.\n\nUNHCR's response to internal displacement in 2019 focused on the coordination of protection and shelter/NFI clusters, protection monitoring, peaceful coexistence projects, prevention and response to SGBV, as well as community empowerment. These approaches were put into practice in two significant, but quite different emergency contexts: that of continued, conflict-induced displacement in the DRC, and the response to Tropical Cyclone Idai.\n\nFocusing on eastern DRC, UNHCR adopted a mutually reinforcing three-pronged approach to tackle cyclical displacement.\n\nThe approach included strengthening and formalizing UNHCR's role in rapid response; expanding its protection work in prevention, community-based approaches, resilience, and social cohesion; and investing in durable solutions.\n\nAs an example of community-based approaches and durable solutions, in\n\nNorth Kivu Province, UNHCR established hectares of communal fields, helping 16\n\nIDPs gain access to agricultural land and contributing to solutions for almost 10,000 IDPs. UNHCR also included host communities in its programming, reinforced local protection structures, and promoted peaceful coexistence, access to justice\n\n(for example, in case of disputes over land and property, which were a major cause of conflict in the DRC), and the participation of IDPs in decision making. UNHCR's support to community protection structures and the strengthening of community complaints mechanisms greatly contributed to improving dialogue with local authorities on the protection of displaced people, and the involvement of IDPs in identifying solutions to their problems.\n\nUNHCR also developed a data matrix for humanitarian actors and other service providers, which contributed to the mobilization of multi-sectoral assistance for 230,000 IDPs across 51 sites.\n\nAs Protection Cluster co-lead within the inter-agency response to Tropical Cyclone\n\nIdai in Malawi, UNHCR coordinated closely with the authorities and partners to ensure protection was mainstreamed throughout the response, including through preventing and responding to SGBV, as well as sexual exploitation and abuse. UNHCR also provided core relief items to tens of thousands of affected people.\n\nIn Beira, Mozambique, 104 protection focal points were empowered by UNHCR to facilitate peer sensitization on protectionrelated issues; strengthen community structures; identify protection risks, capacities and solutions; and refer protection cases to relevant actors.\n\nDuring 2019, UNHCR's protection monitoring programme in the DRC was reinforced, with an added emphasis on quality of analysis, dissemination practice, and more effective use of monitoring for advocacy purposes.\n\nIn 2019, a total of 31,581 protection incidents were identified and followed up on through legal support, medical assistance, temporary accommodation, cash assistance and other means.\n\nUNHCR also strengthened its communitybased protection work. A range of complementary community-based protection methodologies and tools were used in communities at heightened risk of displacement, and in displaced and hosting communities, including accompaniment of community-based protection structures, quick impact projects, technical support to local authorities and community leaders, and distribution of multi-purpose cash assistance for women at risk of sexual exploitation or negative coping mechanism.\n\nAdvocacy efforts targeting the DRC and the Republic of the Congo to ratify the 1954 and 1961 Conventions resulted in the DRC submitting two draft laws on accession to the 1954 and 1961 Statelessness Conventions in 2019. The Governments of Malawi,\n\nZambia and Zimbabwe committed to acceding to the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Stateless.\n\nThe High-Level Segment generated pledges from 13 countries in the region to 53 end statelessness by 2024. The Republic of the Congo, Eswatini and Zimbabwe adopted national action plans to end statelessness that provide for nationality law reform, and in the case of Eswatini, for the removal of gender discrimination from the nationality law.\n\nIn Malawi, the Citizenship Act was amended to help ensure that both men and women have equal citizenship rights when married to Malawians. In Mozambique, the Government submitted a pledge at the Global Refugee\n\nForum to undertake a comprehensive study on persons at risk of statelessness.\n\n© UNHCR/Luiz Fernando Godinho\n\nCongolese refugees lend a hand to Cyclone Idai survivors\n\nIn a strong show of solidarity, refugees supported the humanitarian response to Cyclone Idai in Mozambique.\n\nResponding to a call by UNHCR for volunteers to help with emergency response activities, Kinga and Kevin, two refugees, volunteered to help those affected by the storm in the port town of Beira, Mozambique.\n\n\"I was protected in Mozambique when I needed help and now, I am giving a hand to those who received me\"\n\n-Kinga, Congolese refugee in Mozambique.\n\nEvery day, Kinga and Kevin joined UNHCR, other aid agencies, and the Mozambican authorities to support response activities in the town.\n\nThese included the registration of cyclone survivors living in improvised shelters, their relocation to more secure settlements and allocation of tents and distribution of core relief items like solar lamps, kitchen sets and blankets.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 85\n\nWEST AND CENTRAL AFRICA\n\n© UNHCR/Jerry de Mars A Malian Tuareg refugee in Burkina Faso brings his goats back to Goudoubo camp.\n\nUNHCR supported West African countries' efforts to strengthen their national asylum systems, with significant improvements in Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and Togo, while new decrees and legislation await parliamentary endorsement in Benin,\n\nBurkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone. UNHCR also rolled-out its Biometric Identity Management\n\nSystem in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the CAR, Chad, Gabon, Guinea, Mali,\n\nNiger and Nigeria, resulting in the biometric enrollment of 130,631 individuals in 2019.\n\nIn Burkina Faso, UNHCR contributed to the issuance of over 76,000 birth certificates,\n\n15,000 nationality certificates and over\n\n7,000 national identity cards to displaced populations and their hosts in 2019, helping thousands at risk of statelessness.\n\nRefugees and migrants on the move across\n\nWest and Central Africa continued to be exposed to severe protection risks such as SGBV, arbitrary detention, torture and human trafficking, as well as attacks by armed groups. In addition to its work to strengthen asylum systems in the region,\n\nUNHCR and its partners provided meaningful alternatives to onward movements, including through UNHCR's\n\nEmergency Transit Mechanism (ETM) in\n\nNiger, which secured the evacuations of refugees from Libya to Niger in 2019. 878\n\nRefugee and IDP women and children were disproportionately affected by violence and exploitation, including\n\nSGBV, for which UNHCR prioritized specialized services such as medical and legal assistance, safe spaces for refugee women and psychosocial support.\n\nDue to the pervasive insecurity across the region and the many attacks on schools,\n\nUNHCR advocated for an increase in educational facilities and alternative learning solutions. Over 110 additional classrooms were constructed or renovated in 2019. In Chad, the \"Can't Wait to Learn\" project engaged locally-based education stakeholders, community-based organizations and international software developers to produce a Ministry of\n\nEducation-approved curriculum accessible on tablets, providing an opportunity for refugee children to work towards primary certification even where no teachers or schools were accessible. In 2019, UNHCR was able to respond to the educational needs of 3 million refugee and IDP children in West and Central Africa, with 736 refugees awarded DAFI scholarships and graduates employed by the United 22\n\nNations Volunteers.\n\nThe discrimination and abuse faced by\n\nLGBTI asylum-seekers was a key concern, with an analysis of their specific needs undertaken, including a mapping of existing support mechanisms and gaps to inform UNHCR's approach to this issue.\n\nFaced with increasing security challenges hindering its access to people of concern,\n\nUNHCR scaled up the use of cash assistance for the provision of shelter and\n\nNFIs and other basic needs, particularly in the Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin, thus facilitating the socioeconomic inclusion of forcibly displaced populations and contributing to strengthening local markets and services. In 2019, over\n\n$11 million worth of cash assistance was distributed, representing over 9% of UNHCR's operational response in 2019, a 6% increase compared to 2018. UNHCR also engaged with governments and development partners in the region to foster stronger linkages between its cash interventions and the existing national social protection schemes and safety-net\n\nIn line with this inclusive approach and given that all refugees have access to public health systems in the West and\n\nCentral Africa region, UNHCR worked towards increasing their enrolment in health insurance schemes by covering their insurance premiums. However, major gaps persisted, with limited numbers of health personnel trained in emergency response and in case detection and management, as well as inadequate treatment units, particularly in remote areas hosting refugees and IDPs in\n\nBurkina Faso, Cameroon, the CAR, Chad, Mali, Niger and Nigeria.\n\nUNHCR operations in the region made over 4,133 resettlement submissions, including for 1,261 for refugees evacuated from Libya through the ETM in Niger, while over 1,246 departed to resettlement countries in 2019. However, with only around 2,800 resettlement places available in 2019, the demand for resettlement opportunities in West and Central Africa considerably exceeded existing opportunities.\n\nUNHCR also explored opportunities for local integration in 2019. The Governments of the Gambia and Guinea-Bissau granted citizenship to more than 5,000 refugees, and in Ghana and Togo, UNHCR engaged with the respective governments on the possibility of providing long-term residence permits to refugees.\n\nClose to 19,800 refugees were repatriated with UNHCR's support across the region, mostly to the CAR (around 12,400 facilitated returns), Mali (3,770), Chad (300),\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 87 and Côte d'Ivoire, where over 3,200 people voluntarily returned, in line with the 2018 roadmap for return and reintegration.\n\nSome 416,000 IDPs also returned to their areas of origin in the Far-North region of Cameroon, the CAR, Mali and Nigeria.\n\nWhile reintegration progressed in the CAR,\n\nChad and Côte d'Ivoire, the deteriorating situation in northern and central Mali was less conducive for sustainable return.\n\nGiven the severity of internal displacement,\n\nUNHCR was instrumental in assembling key actors to address the underlying policy and operational questions surrounding the issue. For example, UNHCR organized the\n\nRegional Protection Dialogue on the Lake\n\nChad Basin in Abuja in January 2019, bringing together representatives from\n\nCameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, as well as key NGOs and UN sister agencies.\n\nSubsequently, an updated regional action plan was announced at the Global Refugee Forum in December. In March, with the\n\nGlobal Protection Cluster and the Economic\n\nCommunity of West African States\n\n(ECOWAS), UNHCR co-organized the\n\nWest Africa Regional Exchange on Law and Policy to address internal displacement with the specific aim to share experiences on domestication and implementation of the Kampala Convention.\n\nWith over 1.65 million people estimated to be stateless or at risk of statelessness, reducing and preventing statelessness was an integral part of UNHCR's strategy in West and Central Africa.\n\nSince the adoption of the Abidjan\n\nDeclaration on the Eradication of\n\nStatelessness in February 2015 by all\n\nMember States of ECOWAS, 12 of its\n\nStates have now ratified both 15\n\nUN Statelessness Conventions and nine have established national action plans to resolve and prevent statelessness.\n\nAmong other initiatives, UNHCR supported birth registration campaigns in Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali and Niger. Sierra Leone removed gender discrimination provisions from its nationality laws which prevented mothers from passing nationality on to their children and Liberia pledged to follow suit in 2020.\n\nAt the October 2019 High-Level Segment on Statelessness, of the 21 countries covered by the Regional Bureau,\n\nStates made 69 pledges for action 17 against statelessness, along with commitments from ECOWAS and the\n\nEconomic and Monetary Community of Central Africa. Building on these achievements, UNHCR continued its advocacy for the ratification of the 1954 Convention and supported the development of national-level mechanisms to prevent statelessness in the region.\n\nIn December 2019, the first edition of a francophone course on nationality and statelessness organized by UNHCR and the Catholic University of Central Africa, was launched in Yaoundé, attracting significant attention including from academia and the media. 35 high-level participants, including members of parliament as well as academics and humanitarian actors participated.\n\n© UNHCR/6M.Productions\n\nThe number of IDPs in West and Central\n\nAfrica reached 5 million by the end of the year, an increase of 30%. Given the rapid deterioration of the security situation across the Sahel, UNHCR scaled up its protection activities for IDPs through targeted assistance to the most vulnerable people including victims of SGBV, shelter and NFI distributions, cash assistance and support to education and health facilities in the main hosting areas. Building on the conclusions from the Regional Dialogue on\n\nProtection and Solutions held in Bamako in\n\nSeptember 2019 with the Governments of\n\nBurkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and\n\nNiger, UNHCR and partners activated seven clusters, including the UNHCR-led\n\nProtection and Shelter/NFI Clusters in Burkina Faso. In the CAR, UNHCR also led the Protection Cluster while co-leading the\n\nShelter and CCCM Clusters, assisting 687,000 IDPs.\n\nMADE 51 initiative expanding to Niger\n\n\"We have learnt to think outside the box, to be creative and to transform simple objects into beautiful pieces of jewelry,\"\n\n-Sidi, a Tuareg artisan, during a MADE51-organized design workshop in Niger in November 2019.\n\nBringing beautiful, refugee-made products to the global market, MADE51 is one of UNHCR's flagship initiatives and represents a commitment to working in new ways with new partners.\n\nIt connects refugee artisans with social enterprises, and with international buyers. MADE51 is implemented in collaboration with the World Fair Trade Organization, with pro-bono input from leading private sector companies.\n\nRecognizing the enormous potential of the artisanal sector to Tuareg refugees, whose culture is deeply tied to craftsmanship, with the support of the EU Trust Fund for Africa, UNHCR began expanding MADE51 in 2019 beyond Burkina Faso, where hundreds of refugees are actively earning a living through their craft. Refugees in countries across the Mali situation-refugees like Sidi-are now benefitting from the opportunities MADE51 can bring, attending trainings, working with fellow artisans, and making new contacts.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 89\n\nOPERATIONAL\n\nHIGHLIGHTS ON THE\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF\n\nTHE GLOBAL COMPACT\n\nON REFUGEES\n\nEast and Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes\n\nIn Kenya, the Garissa Integrated\n\nSocial-Economic Development\n\nProgramme (GISEDP) seeks to strengthen the humanitarian-development nexus, allowing for sustainable growth in Garissa County. The programme, which was developed in 2019, builds on a multi-stakeholder approach to enhance investments and support socioeconomic opportunities for refugees and host communities, with a focus on protection, access to education, health and other basic and social services, self-reliance, environmental protection, sustainable energy solutions and institutional capacity. The GISEDP identified a number of flagship projects to address key challenges affecting both refugees and host communities and will aim to drive Garissa ́s social and economic transformation with the inclusion of refugees.\n\nArea-based comprehensive responses were an integral part of UNHCR's operations in 2019, ensuring refugee and host-community inclusion in the context of UNHCR's humanitarian response. In\n\nEthiopia, UNHCR developed specific advocacy products to catalyze partner investments in refugee-hosting areas, leading to concrete examples of inclusion, such as by the Tigray Regional State, which ensured prioritization in local government plans and led to four schools in host communities that refugees attend being rehabilitated. UNHCR also supported the\n\nGovernment of Ethiopia in developing databases to link refugees to economic opportunities in refugees-hosting areas, as part of the Ethiopia Economic\n\nOpportunities Programme, the first\n\nGovernment initiative targeting economic inclusion of refugees and development of host regions.\n\nIn January 2019, the parliament of Ethiopia adopted a revised refugee law, providing for increased rights to refugees. UNHCR supported the Government to develop the law and is promoting arrangements and guidelines for the issuance of work permits and other documents for refugees in\n\nThe New Finance Bank, a subsidiary of My Bucks Banking Corporation, in Dzaleka camp, Malawi, opened more than 7,500 accounts for people of concern in 2019, stimulating micro-businesses and other entrepreneurial activities. In addition,\n\nMy Bucks also began facilitating financial inclusion of refugees in Maratane refugee camp in Mozambique.\n\nIn Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe, the\n\nPoverty Alleviation Coalition, a global coalition of 15 organizations convened by UNHCR to help alleviate poverty for refugees and host communities, is scaling up the Graduation Approach that benefitted 11,500 refugee and host community members in the three countries. The Governments of\n\nMozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe also made pledges at the Forum on scaling up livelihoods through the provision of arable land to refugees.\n\nWest and Central Africa\n\nIn Cameroon, a support plan for host communities was formulated to ensure inclusion of CAR refugees in development programmes in the most affected areas.\n\nA cost-sharing agreement between the\n\nGovernment and UNHCR provided public health care to CAR refugees, and discussions were initiated in 2019 to explore the possibility of expanding this arrangement to urban refugees. The Government also partnered with the ILO and UNHCR to facilitate refugees' access to the job market by including them in the national labour programme, implemented by the national employment fund.\n\nIn Chad, the Government committed to increasing the capacity of universities in refugee-hosting areas by 10%, to deliver work permits more systematically and to revise the legal framework to increase refugees' land access to enhance their self-reliance through more sustainable income-generating activities. Chad has also demonstrated a clear commitment to the Compact's objective of enhancing refugee self-reliance by integrating refugees more systematically into its national development plan and by promoting a \"villagization approach,\" which aims to integrate refugee settlements within local municipalities, with the aim of reaching the target of fewer than 50% of refugees living in camps by 2023. Four additional refugee camp schools were accredited by the\n\nChadian Government and are now considered national schools, alongside the 108 others accredited in 2018.\n\nCONSEQUENCES OF\n\nUNDERFUNDING\n\nWith only 49% of funding needs met in the\n\nAfrica region in 2019, the consequences of underfunding were many and varied, and seriously affected the delivery of protection and assistance to people of concern.\n\nThis meant the region had to continue prioritizing lifesaving interventions.\n\nActivities aiming at self-reliance suffered from lack of funding; too often returns could not be adequately supported; and too many people remained stateless.\n\nDespite continued population displacements, coordinated assistance to refugees suffered as well, with none of the regional refugee response plans adequately funded.\n\nPercentages of funding ranged from 46% for the Nigeria RRP to 22% for the DRC RRP.\n\nEast and Horn of Africa and the\n\nGreat Lakes\n\nEmergency response and core relief items were critically underfunded, with refugees who had access to adequate dwellings averaging 48%. Support to survivors of\n\nSGBV and unaccompanied children among other persons at heightened risk was limited by available funding. High malnutrition rates caused by food ration cuts remained a matter of grave concern, as well as low access to sanitation.\n\nLimited support to livelihood activities to contribute to refugees' self-reliance led to negative coping mechanisms, compounding protection risks. Overcrowded classrooms averaging 1:130 children per class, low access to education at 54% with critically low enrolment at secondary school, particularly for girls, and limited access to vocational training were concerns.\n\nOperations reported challenges in promoting self-reliance and livelihood interventions to people of concern due to lack of sufficient resources. In Malawi,\n\n70% of people of concern lived below the poverty line but only 2% had access to livelihood interventions. In the DRC, lack of livelihood support hindered not only the self-reliance of people of concern but also peaceful coexistence with local\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 91\n\nLack of resources also affected delivery of education. In Malawi, only half of\n\n9,806 school-age refugee children had access to education. In Mozambique, cyclone damage meant schools had limited capacity to absorb displaced children, while facilities in camps in Malawi and Zambia all needed repair, maintenance and expansion.\n\nSeveral operations, including Angola, the DRC, Malawi and Zambia experienced chronic shortages of food for camp-based refugees. In Malawi, worsening food shortages affected 44,000 refugee and asylum-seekers in Dzaleka refugee camp as food rations provided by WFP were halved due to insufficient funding, resulting in negative coping mechanisms.\n\nIn Mozambique, UNHCR faced significant challenges responding to the needs of approximately 250,000 cyclone-affected people, including IDPs. Heightened protection risks, particularly for women and children, including increased risk of gender-based violence, exacerbated the situation.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, lack of sustainable cooking energy sources led to deforestation in areas surrounding the Tongogara refugee camp, resulting in greater risk of SGBV for women and girls collecting firewood.\n\nUnderfunding affected assistance and solutions programmes across the region, with significant unmet needs in education, shelter, WASH and core relief items causing hardships for vulnerable IDPs and refugees in the Sahel region. 55% of core relief item needs remained underfunded, with only\n\n37,500 households receiving them, leaving thousands of refugees and over 3 million\n\nIDPs deprived of basic assistance, many of whom consequently resorted to negative coping mechanisms including child labor.\n\nIn Burkina Faso, humanitarian assistance covered only about 52% of shelter needs and 48% of needs in SGBV prevention and response. In Mali, only 7% of refugees received cash to cover their priority needs, and more than 49% of shelter needs remained unmet. In Niger, the relocation of over 4,500 Malian refugees, and a further 10,000 in Diffa could not be carried out due to funding constraints.\n\nAcross the region, millions of stateless persons and persons at risk of statelessness continued to live in precarious conditions along border regions. With more funding, UNHCR could\n\nEXPENDITURE IN AFRICA 2015-2019 | USD\n\nLimited access to self-reliance opportunities exposed people of concern to SGBV in all its forms. Lack of funding for biometric registration hindered the access of out-of-camp Nigerian refugees in\n\nCameroon to public health care and education services. The same held true in Mali and Niger, where refugees were excluded from national socioeconomic systems and funding limitations affected their access to health and education.\n\nUNHCR was also forced to limit its efforts to enhance resilience and solutions.\n\nIn Ghana, UNHCR was unable to support self-reliance projects, despite a planned transition away from care and maintenance activities, leading to many refugees living in abject poverty and finding themselves in a worse situation than at the beginning of 2019. In Côte d'Ivoire, only 20% of the most vulnerable returnee households were provided with very basic shelter assistance, insufficient to cover their reintegration and protection needs. In Cameroon, many requests for assistance for voluntary repatriation were not met, and in Mali,\n\n95% of returnees did not receive any form of assistance. Natural resource and energy interventions were also significantly affected in Burkina Faso, Cameroon,\n\nChad and Niger, despite the pre-existing scarcity of natural resources available. have worked with governments on legislative reforms and sought to identify populations at risk of statelessness, while also supporting digitized birth registration.\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION communities. In the Republic of Congo, livelihood opportunities were required for 30,000 refugees and asylum-seekers dependent on food assistance.\n\nSOURCE OF EXPENDITURE FOR AFRICA\n\nSOURCE OF

This brought to nearly 4.5 million the number of Venezuelans who have sought refuge worldwide, most of whom were in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.\n\nIn hosting countries, more than 2 million Venezuelans received regular stay permits or were granted asylum. Within the framework of the Regional\n\nInter-Agency Coordination Platform, UNHCR provided lifesaving assistance in border areas to new arrivals, supported access to basic goods and services, promoted peaceful coexistence with host communities, as well as access to fundamental rights, such as documentation, education and employment.\n\nUnder the leadership of UNHCR and IOM, seven national platforms were established, bringing together partners across 16 countries under the Regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan. These 130\n\nHundreds of thousands of people were on the move in the Americas in 2019 in search of safety and freedom from violence, persecution and widespread human rights violations. By the end of the year, some 4.5 million Venezuelans were displaced worldwide.

More than 170,200 people were registered in PRIMES, with Ecuador and\n\nGuyana adopting it as their national registration tool for asylum-seekers. UNHCR supported the development of biometric registration and case management systems in Argentina, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico,\n\nParaguay, Peru, Uruguay and the Bolivarian\n\nRepublic of Venezuela, thus strengthening national asylum systems and refugee commissions.\n\nThe refugee commissions of Argentina,\n\nMexico and Uruguay improved their procedures to accelerate the recognition of Venezuelans as refugees. Brazil granted refugee status on a prima facie basis for\n\nVenezuelan nationals and Paraguay carried out group recognition of 700 Venezuelans in December 2019. In the Caribbean subregion, where most countries lacked asylum legislation and systems, UNHCR undertook registration and RSD. In Costa Rica and\n\nMexico, new national registration offices were opened with UNHCR's support.\n\nAcross the region, people in transit- especially children, women, LGBTI persons or others at heightened risk-faced harsh conditions. With UNHCR's support, the\n\nRegional Safe Spaces Network provided humanitarian assistance and specialized services to some 50,000 people of concern, and produced a regional toolkit on protection from exploitation and abuse, used to strengthen the capacity of 16,811 partner staff.\n\nTo respond to unprecedented numbers of refugees, asylum-seekers, internally displaced people and other people of concern moving across the region in dire conditions, UNHCR prioritized its response in border and transit areas, facilitating access to food and safe water, hygiene kits and other core relief items through direct assistance, as well as cash and voucher transfers for shelter. Through a network of support spaces and strengthened community mechanisms, the Office provided people of concern with essential information and lifesaving assistance.\n\nAcross the region, 48,887 vulnerable men and women received cash grants or vouchers for basic and domestic items.\n\nUNHCR launched its targeted cash assistance programme in Mexico in 2019, and 42,931 people there benefitted from multi-purpose cash transfers to cover the cost of food, domestic items, and housing and utility expenses. In Brazil, a similar initiative launched in June 2019 reached\n\n3,667 people in 1,297 households, 94% of whom were Venezuelans.\n\nWith worsening shortages of food, medicines, basic supplies and public services in the Bolivarian Republic of\n\nVenezuela, community-centered programmes implemented by UNHCR and partners focused on those at heightened risk, such as children and people with medical conditions or disabilities. Solar lamps and jerry cans were among the 33,896 core relief items given to 79,584 people. With diverse community programmes, UNHCR and partners reached 495,687 individuals across 54 prioritized communities.\n\nRegional Safe\n\nSpaces Network\n\nToolkit\n\nRegional toolKit for pRotection fRom seXual eXploitation and aBuse, seXual haRassment (psea/sh) and inteR-agency community-Based complaint\n\nRefeRRal mechanisms\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 103\n\nThrough the Regional Inter-Agency\n\nCoordination Platform for refugees and migrants from the Bolivarian Republic of\n\nVenezuela, UNHCR supported a network of 152 support spaces in Brazil, Colombia,\n\nEcuador and Peru, where more than\n\n100,000 people a month received information, orientation and basic assistance to meet their most urgent needs. Across Colombia, information kiosks located in 30 sites provided more than 90,000 individuals with general orientation, information on asylum procedures, regularization of migratory status and other legal services and referrals to public services. An additional\n\n20,300 people were sheltered, and\n\n20,000 children had access to child-friendly spaces.\n\nPending durable solutions, to foster inclusion and promote access to livelihood opportunities, UNHCR organized six employment and entrepreneurship fora with the private sector in Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Panama. UNHCR initiatives with UNDP and UNCTAD, such as the\n\nTalento sin Fronteras (Talent Without\n\nBorders) in Panama or its collaboration with the Quito Municipality in Ecuador, proved to be effective public-private alliances that helped create employment opportunities for refugees.\n\nAs highlighted in the Brazil Plan of Action, cities and local authorities played a pivotal role in the socioeconomic inclusion of refugees and migrants. In Argentina, Bolivia,\n\nChile, Paraguay and Uruguay, UNHCR worked with some 30 municipal authorities to foster refugees' integration. In addition,\n\nUNHCR along with the European Union,\n\nIOM and UN-Habitat launched a joint multi-year project to support inclusive cities for Venezuelan refugees and migrants in Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Peru.\n\nUNHCR supported two initiatives led by national authorities in Brazil and Mexico to relocate refugees, asylum-seekers and other people of concern within the country to promote inclusion and access to employment. In Brazil, more than\n\n27,200 Venezuelans were relocated to municipalities, while 5,200 were 409 relocated to four cities in central and northern Mexico (Aguascalientes, Guadalajara, Monterrey and Saltillo).\n\nIn the region, 2,029 people were submitted for resettlement, including women or girls at risk, or survivors of violence and torture among others. With the support of the\n\nEmerging Resettlement Countries Joint\n\nSupport Mechanism, Brazil implemented its first ever State-funded resettlement programme, focusing mainly on refugees from the NCA region. By the end of 2019,\n\nArgentina had admitted 443 Syrian refugees, the largest number among emerging resettlement countries.\n\nEnsuring protection, assistance and solutions in internal displacement contexts\n\nThe peace agreement between the\n\nGovernment of Colombia and the\n\nFARC-the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-continued to face difficulties.\n\nIn parts of the country, notably border areas and the Pacific Coast, insecurity prevailed as a result of the reconfiguration of armed groups and growing social unrest. UNHCR supported 3,573 people of concern and 132 community-based organizations in the most displacement-affected regions, many from indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities.\n\nAs part of UNHCR's support to Colombia's special peace tribunal, more than 100 leaders from Catatumbo, Chocó and Nariño were trained in accessing transitional justice mechanisms. UNHCR also facilitated dialogue and coordination between public oversight institutions, the Government and the Constitutional Court to ensure a coherent national response to internal displacement.\n\nAs part of UNHCR's strategy to support the legalization of prioritized, informal peri-urban settlements, 13 settlements were legalized, and 16,125 people benefitted from property titles.\n\nIn El Salvador, with UNHCR assistance, the Government prepared, and later approved, a historic new law recognizing the rights of internally displaced populations and ensuring victims of forced displacement had access to protection and services.\n\nUnder the Towards Zero Statelessness mechanism, UNHCR actively engaged with\n\nStates, partners and regional organizations to present pledges and commitments at the\n\nOctober 2019 High-Level Segment on Statelessness. Argentina, Belize, Colombia,\n\nCosta Rica, Guyana, Haiti, Panama, Paraguay, the United States of America and Uruguay presented 32 pledges aimed at eradicating statelessness in the region by 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Argentina adopted comprehensive legislation to protect stateless persons, which included provisions for their naturalization. In Colombia, some\n\n27,000 children born to Venezuelan parents are now acquiring Colombian nationality.\n\nThe country also deposited instruments of accession to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons.\n\nThe Latin American and Caribbean\n\nCouncil for Civil Registration, Identity and\n\nVital Statistics (CLARCIEV) held its annual meeting in Chile in September 2019, with support from UNHCR, the Organization of\n\nAmerican States and its Universal Civil Identity Program in the Americas. CLARCIEV pledged to continue promoting universal birth registration, the issuance of identity documents, and action to prevent and resolve statelessness across the region.\n\nA comparative study on statelessness and late birth registration is now underway and is co-led by UNHCR, the Organization of American States and CLARCIEV.\n\nOperational highlights on the implementation of the Global\n\nCompact on Refugees\n\nDuring 2019, seven Central American countries, all members of the Comprehensive\n\nRegional Protection and Solutions\n\nFramework, or MIRPS in Spanish, (including its newest member El Salvador), worked collaboratively to expand the inclusion of refugee and internally displaced people in national development plans. In Belize for instance, refugees and asylum-seekers were integrated in an education initiative resulting in 190 graduating from a State-led programme teaching English as a second language. In Panama, a labour integration programme, Talent Without Borders, was developed with UNHCR, resulting in refugees and migrants, but also 150\n\nPanamanians, finding jobs.\n\nIn line with the MIRPS, additional steps were taken to strengthen asylum services across Central America. In Costa Rica, the Government decentralized its asylum services, allowing claims to be filed at border areas. In Mexico, the national asylum authority, COMAR, created a specialized registration directorate and opened new offices in strategic locations, such as Monterrey, Palenque and Tijuana, to address the growing number of people with international protection needs.\n\nMIRPs II Annual\n\nReport\n\nII Annual Report of the Regional\n\nComprehensive\n\nProtection & Solutions\n\nFramework (MIRPS)\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 105\n\nResponding to mixed movements in Brazil\n\nThe majority of the Venezuelan refugees and migrants in\n\nBrazil, who numbered 253,000 by November 2019, arrived through the Pacaraima crossing, in the state of Roraima.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for UNHCR in Brazil was to voluntarily relocate refugees and migrants from Roraima, where capacities were stretched, to other states in the country.\n\nThe answer was the Interiorization Programme, created by the\n\nGovernment of Brazil with the support of UNHCR and other humanitarian actors. By the end of 2019, the Programme had relocated more than 27,200 Venezuelans to 409 municipalities across all five regions of Brazil, where possibilities for socioeconomic integration are greater.\n\nThrough Operação Acolhida (Operation Welcome), a partnership between the Government of Brazil and UNHCR along with over 100 partners including IOM, UNFPA, UNICEF, UN Women, civil society organizations and the private sector, a full range of services and benefits complement the relocation. These services provide protection and support, offering the chance of a new life to the most vulnerable Venezuelan refugees and migrants, either in Roraima or other states.\n\nThe agencies perform different roles across the three main pillars of the operation: border control and documentation, humanitarian assistance and shelter, and the interiorization strategy. This is an example of inter-agency coordination and partnership where different UN agencies including UNFPA, UN Women and UNICEF, in coordination with UNHCR and IOM, leverage their competence and strengths to support the displaced population as part of the Venezuelan Refugee and Migrant Response Plan. required funding in 2019, leaving half of the 2.2 million targeted beneficiaries without assistance. While community-based initiatives helped promote peaceful coexistence, insufficient funding limited the scope of much needed anti-xenophobia campaigns, such as \"Tu causa es mi causa\" in Peru. Inside the Bolivarian Republic of\n\nVenezuela, UNHCR was unable to provide legal assistance to people of concern undergoing asylum procedures, survivors of SGBV, and parents seeking reunification with their children across borders.\n\nUnderfunding also hampered advocacy efforts to prevent internal displacement in Colombia. Funds intended to support the\n\nGovernment's monitoring of Colombian returnees from the Bolivarian Republic of\n\nVenezuela, especially those still in need of international protection, were insufficient.\n\nReintegration activities for vulnerable returnees received no funding, with the exception of voluntary repatriation cash vouchers granted to a few spontaneous returnees who approached UNHCR offices.\n\nEXPENDITURE IN THE AMERICAS 2015-2019 | USD \"I was living on the streets of Boa Vista, looking for food. UNHCR provided me with shelter, and put me forward as a candidate for the Interiorization Programme. Two months later, I moved to Dourados (in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul).

In Guatemala, additional capacity would have allowed new field offices to open in Esquipulas (covering the borders with Honduras and El Salvador) and Tecun Uman (covering the border with Mexico). Despite growing numbers of people fleeing Nicaragua, reduced financial support limited the ability to scale up UNHCR's border presence in Costa Rica.\n\nLifesaving assistance reached only the most vulnerable, prioritizing where possible\n\nUnderfunding negatively impacted solutions-oriented activities in particular.\n\nWith additional resources, UNHCR could have fostered livelihoods opportunities through education, vocational training or self-employment support, specifically targeting young people in border areas of Ecuador who are at heightened risk of resorting to negative coping mechanisms for survival, such as transactional sex.\n\nThe Regional Response Plan for\n\nVenezuelans received 52% of its children, single-headed households, or individuals with severe medical conditions. In Peru, only 13.5% of households in need of assistance received cash transfers or core relief items.

UNHCR placed considerable focus on strengthening the protection environment through community-based mechanisms, including a network of community outreach members who identified and referred people at heightened risk within the refugee population to specialized services, disseminating as well lifesaving information. In total, 3,965 refugees were referred to service providers and direct support was provided by community outreach members to\n\n6,980 people, while more than 14,000 emergency preparedness awareness sessions were conducted across the camps.\n\nIn 2019, progress in resolving the root causes of displacement stalled, meaning durable solutions remained out of reach for most people of concern to UNHCR in the region. However, in collaboration with governments and other partners, UNHCR made continued progress in securing the inclusion of the displaced in national systems.\n\nRefugee camp\n\nIDP camp\n\nRohingya refugee outflow\n\n6,980 refugees at heightened risk in Bangladesh benefited from\n\nUNHCR's network of community outreach members\n\nIn Myanmar itself, UNHCR advocated the rights and status of some 600,000 Rohingya who remain in Rakhine State, 140,000 of whom are internally displaced, as well as the protection of over 170,000 other IDPs throughout the country. UNHCR also worked with UNDP to conduct needs assessments and implement quick impact projects to improve conditions in the northern townships of Rakhine State, home to most Rohingya. Throughout Rakhine\n\nState, fighting between the Myanmar armed forces and the Arakan Army, an ethnic Rakhine armed group, led to a 25% increase in the total number of IDPs in Myanmar.\n\nISLAMIC AFGHANISTAN\n\nOF IRAN\n\nPAKISTAN\n\nKachin State\n\nBANGLADESH\n\nCox's Bazar\n\nAFGHANISTAN\n\n951,100\n\nREGISTERED AFGHAN REFUGEES\n\nIN THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN 2.6 million\n\nThe Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees (SSAR) remained the overarching policy and operational framework for strengthening support to host countries while creating the conditions for sustainable return and reintegration. Entering its eighth year, the SSAR was augmented by a support platform under the Global Compact on Refugees, focused on resilience and youth empowerment through education, health and skills, and which prioritized investments in humanitarian-development-peace-related activities in the priority areas of return and reintegration (PARRs) in Afghanistan. 500,000 people benefited from UNHCR's investment in education, health care, WASH, and other community infrastructure projects in the PARRs, jointly approved by UNHCR and the Government of Afghanistan.\n\nWith more than 400,000 new conflict-induced IDPs recorded in 2019 in Afghanistan, UNHCR continued to co-lead the Protection Cluster and Shelter and NFI Cluster, working towards strengthening the humanitarian-development-peace nexus and the long-term integration of IDPs. With 72% of displaced households reporting shelter as their main priority after food, UNHCR rolled out a pilot cash-for-shelter project, aimed at assisting vulnerable households to construct permanent shelter by providing conditional cash (around $3,300 per household).\n\n8,079 Afghan refugee returnees assisted with voluntary repatriation cash grants\n\nIn Pakistan, 22 refugee-affected and hosting areas programme projects were implemented, benefitting some 280,000 people 1.12 million\n\nFROM MYANMAR\n\n855,000\n\n8,079\n\nAFGHAN REFUGEE RETURNEES\n\n48%\n\nOF AFGHAN REFUGEES IN\n\nPAKISTAN ARE CHILDREN\n\n480,000 Afghan and Iraqi children secondary schools in the Islamic\n\nRepublic of Iran, including\n\n130,000 undocumented Afghan children\n\n92,000 vulnerable refugees benefited from the Islamic\n\nRepublic of Iran's Universal Public\n\nHealth Insurance programme through UNHCR's contribution to the scheme (including\n\n1,182 refugees with specific medication conditions)\n\nNEW CONFLICT-INDUCED IDPS\n\nIN AFGHANISTAN\n\nRakhine State\n\nIN PAKISTAN\n\nShan State\n\n(North)\n\n1.42 million\n\nWhile voluntary repatriation to Afghanistan reached a new low due to uncertainty over the political transition and the deteriorating security situation, onward movements to Europe increased. 8,079 Afghan refugee returnees were assisted with voluntary repatriation cash grants in 2019, including 6,062 from Pakistan and 1,939 from the Islamic Republic of Iran. This was nearly half the number of repatriations recorded and assisted in 2018.\n\n784,387 refugees were registered in Bangladesh\n\nUNHCR, IOM and the UN Resident Coordinator led the coordination and implementation of the\n\nJoint Response Plan for the Rohingya humanitarian crisis with 132 partners, focusing on delivering 2019 protection, providing lifesaving assistance and fostering social cohesion.\n\nEntering the fifth decade of displacement, Afghans are the second largest refugee population globally, while Pakistan remains the world's second largest refugee-hosting country (with 69% of Afghan refugees residing in urban areas), and the Islamic Republic of Iran ranks sixth (with 97% of Afghan refugees residing in urban areas).\n\n15,000 individuals in Myanmar benefited from 16 community infrastructure projects and projects targeting persons at 4 heightened risk\n\nIN BANGLADESH\n\n312,000\n\n1.57 million\n\nSTATELESS PERSONS (600,000 IN\n\nMYANMAR AND 970,000 REFUGEES\n\nAND ASYLUM-SEEKERS)\n\n78%\n\nOF REFUGEES IN BANGLADESH ARE\n\nWOMEN OR CHILDREN\n\nFigure represents Afghans whose return was facilitated by UNHCR and who were processed at encashment centers in Afghanistan.\n\nIN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC 4.2 MILLION\n\n25%\n\n9.5 million people of concern in Asia and the Pacific\n\n137,000\n\n33%\n\n3.2 MILLION\n\nASYLUM-SEEKERS\n\n212,000\n\n12% STATELESS PERSONS (2.3 MILLION IN TOTAL*)\n\n632,000\n\n* Chart reflects UNHCR's statistical reporting methodology that reports only one legal status for each person of concern.

Under the voluntary repatriation programme, returning refugees receive a cash grant to aid their repatriation and reintegration.\n\nFigure represents Afghans whose return was facilitated by UNHCR and processed at encashment centers in Afghanistan.\n\n7,651\n\nUNHCR-facilitated departures\n\n5,719 individuals submitted for resettlement by UNHCR\n\nAt the Global Refugee Forum, UNHCR, with the Islamic Republics of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan, launched a Support Platform for the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees (SSAR). The Platform strengthens international responsibility-sharing through expanded partnerships and investments, prioritizing support in core areas-education, health, livelihoods, infrastructure, energy and water-and across population groups in the three countries to enable solutions in Afghanistan, while easing the burden on host communities in the Islamic Republics of Iran and Pakistan. This includes investments in humanitarian-development-peacerelated activities in 20 PARRs in Afghanistan.\n\nIn Pakistan, the refugee-affected and hosting areas (RAHA) programme remained a cornerstone of the SSAR. Since 2009, some 4,260 RAHA projects have benefited over 12.4 million refugees and host community members. In the Islamic\n\nRepublic of Iran, the Government remained committed to ensuring all Afghan children could access education and enabled more than 480,000 Afghan and Iraqi children to enroll in public schools. In Afghanistan, a wide range of projects implemented in the\n\nPARRs contributed to the safe reintegration of returnees and IDPs in local communities, reaching some 500,000 beneficiaries.\n\nResponding to the needs of the Rohingya remained a priority, particularly refugees in Bangladesh and those who remained stateless in Myanmar. In Bangladesh,\n\nUNHCR and the Government completed the registration of 855,000 Rohingya refugees, securing their identity and facilitating the prioritization of lifesaving assistance. A key success has been UNHCR's distribution of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and improved cooking stoves. Over\n\n107,000 refugee households in the camps now receive LPG supplies and refills, as well as 10,700 host community families.\n\nA study has found that LPG distribution has resulted in an 80% reduction of demand for firewood by Rohingya households in the camps, positively benefitting sustainable tree growth and reforestation, and reducing other risks such as sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) (see\n\nOverview on Climate change for more details on p.29).\n\nIn Myanmar, UNHCR and UNDP worked with the Government to improve conditions in Rakhine State. Access was sporadic, but they were able to conduct needs assessments in villages and implement 45 quick impact 102 projects in northern Rakhine State. UNHCR advocated for root causes to be addressed by implementing the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, including on freedom of movement and a clear pathway to citizenship.\n\nAcross the region, despite limited accession to the 1951 Refugee Convention, several governments pursued policy shifts that will improve refugees' access to basic rights.\n\nIn Malaysia, the Government is considering plans to grant refugees the right to work in certain sectors, while in Indonesia, refugee children can now enroll in public schools.\n\nMeanwhile, Thailand approved the establishment of a screening mechanism to identify people in need of international protection.\n\nFollowing the terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka in April 2019, the Government ensured the security of refugees and assisted with their relocation, while resettlement countries admitted 368 individuals at risk in the wake of the attacks.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 115\n\nIn late 2019, when approximately people from West Papua, Indonesia, 200 fled violent unrest to remote areas in\n\nPapua New Guinea, UNHCR provided emergency assistance through a local faith-based partner.\n\nIn Central Asia, UNHCR successfully advocated for non-refoulement in complex cases and supported the Almaty Process to address mixed population movements.\n\nThroughout the region, UNHCR provided technical support on mixed movements through the Bali Process on People\n\nSmuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime. UNHCR in partnership with IOM launched campaigns to raise awareness in refugee camps in\n\nBangladesh on the dangers of irregular maritime movements.\n\nWith two-thirds of refugees in the region living in urban and semi-urban areas,\n\nUNHCR's community engagement was critical to ensuring accountability to affected populations. Outreach volunteer programmes in Bangladesh (900 volunteers), Malaysia and Pakistan (1,800 volunteers) enhanced community mobilization and referral mechanisms for individuals at risk.\n\nDue to protracted conflict and insecurity, declining resettlement quotas and few opportunities for local integration, durable solutions remained scarce.\n\nDespite the resettlement needs of more than 100,000 refugees, fewer than 8,000 departed. Some 2,500 people of concern were able to access complementary pathways, primarily in\n\nAustralia and Canada, through humanitarian admission and private sponsorship programmes.\n\nJust 8,079 Afghan refugee returnees were assisted with voluntary repatriation cash grants in 2019, nearly half as many as in 2018.\n\nReasons for the fall in numbers included increased insecurity, which led to a rise in conflict-induced IDPs; uncertain outcomes from the presidential elections, political transitions and peace negotiations; and\n\nAfghanistan's limited absorption capacity and reintegration opportunities, particularly related to land, livelihoods and basic services.\n\nIn 2019, 880 refugees returned from\n\nThailand to Myanmar, while UNHCR worked with both governments to achieve a dignified and sustainable end to the decades-long encampment of the remaining 93,000 refugees in Thailand.\n\nUNHCR's facilitated voluntary return programme also enabled 1,070 refugees to return to Sri Lanka, mostly from India.\n\nClose to 500 individuals remained in\n\nPapua New Guinea and Nauru as a result of Australia's offshore processing policy.\n\nApproximately 200 people are in various stages of the resettlement process, with the remaining individuals still requiring solutions.\n\nWith more than 312,000 IDPs across the country, Myanmar adopted a national strategy on IDP camp closure and return in November 2019. With partners, UNHCR coordinated protection responses and assisted vulnerable households, while continuing to advocate for freedom of movement and non-discrimination.\n\nIn Afghanistan, more than 400,000 people were newly displaced internally by conflict, bringing the total number of IDPs in Afghanistan to 2.6 million. At the same time, drought and other disasters continued to result in non-conflict-related internal displacement. UNHCR co-led the Protection and Emergency Shelter/NFI Clusters and provided tents to 2,137 households, as well as core relief items and sanitary kits to 50,650 households. Through protection monitoring, UNHCR reached out to 68,794 people of concern.\n\nArmed conflict and disasters continued to drive internal displacement in the Philippines, with at least 294,000 IDPs in Mindanao.\n\nUNHCR provided 2,730 affected families with core relief items and supported authorities with protection interventions, capacity building and technical advice on emergency preparedness and response.\n\nStates in the region made 29 pledges at the High-Level Segment on Statelessness, led by Central Asia, where the nationality issues of more than 79,000 people have been resolved since 2014. In 2019, the\n\nKyrgyz Republic became the first country to resolve all known cases of statelessness on its territory, after granting nationality to 13,700 stateless persons over the last five years; Uzbekistan announced plans to enact a progressive citizenship law and grant nationality to almost 50,000 stateless residents; Turkmenistan adopted a national action plan to end statelessness by 2024 and accelerated naturalization; Tajikistan enacted an amnesty law which will enable stateless persons to acquire legal status and apply for Tajik citizenship; and\n\nKazakhstan enabled all children born in the country to be issued birth certificates, regardless of their parents' legal status.\n\nA Kyrgyz human rights lawyer won the 2019\n\nNansen Refugee Award for his contribution to the eradication of statelessness in his country (see section on Public Campaigns and Goodwill Ambassadors).\n\nIn South-East Asia, almost 60,000 formerly stateless persons in Thailand have either acquired nationality or had their nationality confirmed since the beginning of the\n\n#IBelong Campaign in 2014; Malaysia began resolving statelessness among ethnic Tamils of Indian descent; and both the Philippines and Viet Nam are in the process of acceding to the statelessness conventions. Through the ASEAN\n\nCommission on the Promotion and\n\nProtection of the Rights of Women and\n\nChildren, UNHCR supported Member\n\nStates to share good practices and research on birth registration, legal identity and the right to nationality.\n\nIn Assam, India, a national register of citizens exercise at its first stage excluded nearly 2 million residents, posing a potential risk of statelessness.\n\nThe Government has clarified that exclusion from the final national registry will have no implications for the rights of individual residents and those excluded will not be rendered stateless or detained.\n\nThe Government of Pakistan's landmark decision in February 2019 to enable\n\nAfghan refugees to open bank accounts paved the way for their greater economic and financial inclusion, in line with the key objectives of the Global Compact on Refugees. By the end of the year, close to 3,200 registered refugees had opened bank accounts in Pakistan.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 117\n\nIn line with the pledge it made at the\n\nSeptember 2016 Leaders' Summit on\n\nRefugees, the Government of Thailand approved the establishment of a screening mechanism to distinguish people in need of international protection from migrants.\n\nIt is hoped that the mechanism will regularize the stay of people in need of international protection in Thailand and lend predictability to the asylum process.\n\nThe approval follows a further pledge made during the Global Refugee Forum to strengthen the capacity and skills of its officers to effectively implement this mechanism.\n\nWith a long history of hosting refugees, the Philippines pledged to further enhance its policy, legal and operational framework to ensure refugees' full access to rights.\n\nIn 2019, in cooperation with UNHCR and\n\nIOM, it continued implementing an emergency transit mechanism (ETM).\n\nBy 2019, more than 350 refugees were resettled through the ETM. In addition to exploring complementary pathways for admitting refugees, the Philippines is looking at strengthening public-private partnerships for refugees' livelihood training.\n\nUnderfunding hampered UNHCR's ability to comprehensively deliver protection, solutions and assistance to people of concern in a number of situations across the region.\n\nActivities were curtailed for two of UNHCR's largest humanitarian responses-the\n\nMyanmar and Afghanistan situations-and for several less high-profile operations.\n\nIn Myanmar, UNHCR provided 3,772 fewer shelters than originally planned due to funding constraints. Funding gaps in\n\nBangladesh mostly affected sanitation and hygiene interventions, including the construction of latrines and bathing areas.\n\nAyshea Bibi, a 3rd grade student, was delighted with the construction of the new classrooms in her schools.\n\n\"Our school was old and the building was all cracked, but with this new school, we don't want to miss a single day!\"\n\nUNHCR, together with the Government of Pakistan and other stakeholders, partnered in 2009 to launch the\n\nRefugee Affected Hosting Area programme, which entered its 10th year in 2019.\n\nToday, it is a cornerstone of the implementation of the regional Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees in Pakistan and plays a vital role in achieving the objectives set out in the Global Compact on Refugees. Thanks to broad-based partnerships with the Government, international community, humanitarian and development actors, and the private sector, 4,260 projects worth $220 million have been carried out across the health, livelihoods, education, water and community infrastructure sectors. These projects have benefitted more than 12.4 million refugees and their host communities, including refugees like Hafeez Khan.\n\n\"The people of our village and their livestock used to drink water from the same ponds, but after the RAHA project, we receive clean drinking water at our doorstep\".\n\n-Hafeez Khan, Afghan refugee living in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.\n\nUNHCR/Zikrea Saleah\n\nSupporting the RAHA programme in Pakistan\n\nUnderfunding meant a range of activities in the three countries of the Afghanistan situation could not be met, in particular, the ability to make a significant investment in solutions and better futures was curtailed.\n\nIn Afghanistan, return monitoring activities conducted by UNHCR identified hesitancy by Afghan refugee returnees about the country's limited absorption capacity. A lack of livelihoods, land, shelter, and access to basic services were highlighted by refugee returnees as the primary obstacles to return.\n\nFunding shortages forced UNHCR to focus on the most crucial needs among the wider gaps existing in the PARRs. As a result, the situation in many return areas, where\n\nUNHCR was often the only provider of assistance, remained challenging and people of concern remained at risk of adopting negative coping mechanisms. To address protection risks and vulnerabilities, and to ensure the sustainability of return in the medium and long term, greater investment in reintegration, pursued in cooperation with development actors through a community-based approach, was needed to facilitate access to basic services, livelihoods for youth, land, and shelter.\n\nIn Pakistan, the Government enabled refugees to access national public service delivery systems, such as education, health, and livelihoods despite significant challenges, including low absorption capacity and variable quality of services.\n\nThe imperative to continue mobilizing resources for the severely underfunded RAHA programme remained a challenge.\n\nIn the Islamic Republic of Iran, UNHCR was able to make important contributions, however, rapidly increasing needs amidst budgetary constraints led to stringent prioritization and continued donor outreach to mobilize resources to meet a range of unmet needs, including support for the\n\nGovernment's progressive health and education policies. Given the significant efforts UNHCR made to support the country's Universal Public Health Insurance\n\nProgramme, this left little scope for other activities, such as cash assistance, education, primary health care or livelihoods.\n\nOperations such as India, Indonesia,\n\nMalaysia, Nepal and Thailand were forced to contend with even more severe resource constraints, resulting in fewer cash-based interventions and limited livelihood activities. Self-reliance support was restricted to only the most vulnerable, and outreach activities and monitoring coverage were reduced for people of concern residing in these countries.\n\nThese lower profile operations received very little funding themselves and mostly relied on regionally earmarked or unearmarked funding, highlighting the importance of flexible funding to allow\n\nUNHCR to prioritize the

Important steps were taken to ensure refugees could access national health systems, labour markets and education, while European States also showed solidarity with host countries by receiving refugees through resettlement and complementary pathways.\n\nLocal volunteers, Karmele Villarroel Labanda (kneeling) and Begonia Herrero, an 82-year-old retired auxiliary nurse, entertain a Syrian refugee family on a day trip to the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain.\n\n-Pascale Moreau, Director, Regional Bureau for Europe\n\n© UNHCR/Markel Redondo\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 125\n\nMAJOR SITUATIONS OR OPERATIONS IN EUROPE IN 2019\n\nUKRAINE\n\nEurope continued to offer safety and protection to refugees fleeing conflict and persecution, while providing vital support to displacement situations elsewhere. The overall number of Mediterranean Sea arrivals continued to steadily decrease. Turkey continued to host the highest number of refugees worldwide as the number of people of concern in Turkey remained stable.\n\nLow-intensity armed conflict continued along the contact line in eastern Ukraine, meaning vulnerable people living near or along it had to contend with insecurity, while movement restrictions and the suspension of social benefits continued to have a negative impact on well-being.\n\nUNHCR continued implementing its 2018-2022 Multi-year, multi-partner (MYMP) protection and solutions strategy, working with partners to deliver emergency assistance on both sides of the contact line. In support of national efforts to repair conflict-damaged homes, a shelter assistance programme resulted in the repair of 1,330 shelters.\n\nOperational constraints in non-government-controlled areas saw individuals given materials to repair homes themselves, while NGOs and contractors undertook more significant repairs.\n\n$1.4 million distributed in cash\n\n2,666 people of concern received long-term/permanent shelter while\n\n1,133 households were reached\n\n2,170 asylum-seekers received psychosocial support\n\nUNHCR's advocacy supported significant legislative changes which strengthened IDPs' voting and housing rights. Notably, an amendment to Ukraine's electoral code facilitated their rights to vote in local elections, while greater government funding for an affordable housing programme supported access to adequate housing for 785 IDP households.\n\nUnited Nations estimate of number of IDPs residing in government-controlled areas of Ukraine as of end-2019. 1\n\nTURKEY 3.9 million\n\nPEOPLE OF CONCERN IN TURKEY 2.5 million\n\nPEOPLE OF CONCERN IN\n\nUKRAINE AND NEIGHBOURING\n\nCOUNTRIES\n\n328,000\n\n2,200\n\n98%\n\nREFUGEES IN UKRAINE\n\nSYRIANS LIVE IN URBAN,\n\nPERI-URBAN AND RURAL AREAS\n\n2,400\n\nIn line with its MYMP strategy, UNHCR protects and assists persons with specific needs residing in non-government-controlled 2 areas or within 20 km of the contact line in government-controlled areas; 81% reside in non-government-controlled areas.\n\nWhile the number of assisted persons is not expected to change compared to previous years, the population estimate increased following introduction of a new methodology used at the inter-sectoral level in preparing the Humanitarian Needs Overview for 2020.\n\nASYLUM-SEEKERS IN UKRAINE\n\n734,000 1\n\nSYRIANS RESIDE IN 7 TEMPORARY\n\nACCOMMODATION CENTRES\n\n35,600\n\nSTATELESS 1.7 million\n\nCONFLICT-AFFECTED PEOPLE 2\n\nMEDITERRANEAN ROUTES\n\nSome 123,700 refugees and asylum-seekers arrived in Europe through Mediterranean routes in 2019-a 15% decrease compared to 2018. A significant proportion (27%) were children. While fewer arrivals through the Mediterranean\n\nSea meant fewer deaths, an estimated 1,336 people died crossing the Mediterranean Sea compared to 2,277 in 2018.\n\nWhile Mediterranean Sea arrivals fell, more people of concern arrived in Cyprus, Greece, Malta and Spain than in 2018. Arrivals to Greece nearly doubled, representing 60% of all new arrivals to the continent. A significant spike in new arrivals to Greece during the second half of 2019 exacerbated poor conditions in and around the Aegean Islands' reception and identification centres. UNHCR supported the authorities to address the asylum and reception needs of asylum-seekers, including through large-scale cash and accommodation schemes.\n\nThe authorities also sought to include refugees in national social services, and other structures.\n\n$102.8 million distributed in cash assistance benefitting\n\n121,247 people of concern\n\n2,324 unaccompanied and separated children supported through guardianship programmes in Greece\n\n85,187 asylum-seekers received information on government status determination procedures\n\nSPAIN\n\nIn Spain, UNHCR worked with the Government to strengthen asylum procedures and improve outreach and access to information for asylum-seekers arriving by sea. A community-sponsorship programme saw communities in Spain's Basque Country play an active role in expanding alternative legal pathways for admission through support for the reception and integration of Syrian refugees.\n\nCYPRUS\n\nGREECE\n\nMALTA In Italy, the fall in arrivals saw UNHCR strengthen its community-based protection efforts. To enhance social integration, work placements, as well as vocational training and further access to education, were actively promoted for refugees.\n\nNational reception capacities in Cyprus and Malta came under strain due to increased arrivals and asylum applications. UNHCR supported the authorities to reinforce national reception capacity, while improving access to information and assistance for people of concern. In Cyprus, UNHCR's advocacy saw asylum-seekers receive larger allowances to meet their basic needs.\n\n123,700\n\nARRIVALS\n\nWOMEN\n\nGREECE: 74,600\n\nSPAIN: 32,500\n\n11,500\n\nITALY:\n\n3,400\n\nMALTA:\n\nCYPRUS: 1,700\n\nUkraine operation\n\nMediterranean routes: main country of arrival\n\nTURKEY*\n\nTurkey continued to host the world's largest refugee population under UNHCR's mandate, with nearly 3.6 million Syrians under its temporary protection in addition to some 330,000 refugees and asylum-seekers from other countries.\n\nUNHCR supported the Directorate General of Migration Management (DGMM) verify more than 2.7 million Syrians under temporary protection, updating registration records and identifying those at heightened risk. Cash assistance was vital, particularly for people with specific needs.\n\nTurkey continued to allow refugees to access national services such as health and education, with UNHCR supporting overstretched national services. Strengthened operational partnerships with relevant State institutions facilitated both the inclusion of refugees and peaceful coexistence of communities, in line with the 2018 National Strategy on Harmonization.\n\nWith ISKUR, the Turkish Employment Agency, and the Turkish Labour Agency, UNHCR facilitated livelihood opportunities and access to the labour market for refugees, including their enrollment in national institutions for certified skills training.\n\n* More details on UNHCR's response to the needs of Syrian refugees in Turkey are included in the chapter on the Middle East and North Africa.\n\n100,337 refugees received cash assistance for protection, education and relocation from\n\n5,123 refugees and 8,740 host community members were reached through the joint\n\nUNHCR-DGMM harmonization initiative through 48 events in 31 provinces\n\n10,558 people of concern departed for resettlement, while\n\n17,552 submissions for resettlement were made to 18 countries\n\nIN EUROPE\n\n54%\n\n6.6 million\n\nLess than 12.1 million people of concern in Europe\n\n16% IDPs\n\nMILLION 2\n\n10% ASYLUM-SEEKERS\n\n4% STATELESS PERSONS\n\n528,000\n\n15% OTHERS OF CONCERN 1.8 MILLION\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 127\n\nACHIEVEMENTS AND KEY RESULTS IN EUROPE\n\nINFORMATION ON ACCESS TO STATUS\n\nDETERMINATION PROCEDURES\n\n800,000\n\n117,164\n\nReception conditions\n\n779,672\n\n700,000 people of concern across\n\nEurope benefitted from improved reception conditions\n\n600,000\n\n2,324\n\n287,604\n\n123,441\n\n21,405\n\n64,519 unaccompanied and separated children supported through guardianship programmes in\n\n97,413 legal assistance\n\n$133 distributed in cash assistance\n\n$74\n\n$33.8\n\n$133 million $104.1\n\n$11.5\n\n227,471 cash assistance\n\nUSD m illio n s refugee-led and communitybased organizations supported\n\nCommunitybased\n\nTO EUROPE of refugees lived in countries where they have the legal right to work\n\n27,450\n\n26,081\n\n29,027\n\n18,175\n\n11,175\n\n46% of global resettlement departures were to countries in Europe of resettlement submissions in\n\nEurope included children\n\nUNHCR supported the region's governments in strengthening asylum systems to improve the identification of people in need of international protection. Notably, in Eastern\n\nEurope, the Quality Initiative remained a useful framework for asylum-related capacity development. In Moldova, an internal quality-control mechanism improved decision making, while Georgia saw a rise in recognition rates, from 5.5% in 2018 to 13% in 2019, following greater use of country of origin information, among other improvements.\n\nIn Greece, UNHCR's quality assurance work with the Greek Asylum Service supported the service's expansion and national efforts to ensure consistency in recognition rates.\n\nIn 2019, the proportion of asylum-seekers who were accorded refugee status or a complementary form of protection at first instance increased from 49% in 2018 to 56%.\n\nUNHCR worked with Turkey's DGMM to enhance registration and protection procedures. Together, 40 e-learning modules were developed in support of training, more than 500 bilingual support personnel were deployed and the availability of country of origin information was increased.\n\nSouth-Eastern Europe (Albania,\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro,\n\nNorth Macedonia and Serbia (and Kosovo:\n\n(S/RES/1244 (1999)*)) remained an important transit corridor for mixed movements to Europe. A range of initiatives were implemented to reinforce national asylum infrastructures in the region with the objective of strengthening access to international protection and potential solutions. The revision of a regional border monitoring tool played an important role in the harmonization of data collection and the identification of protection concerns related to access to asylum. Individual legal counselling and strategic litigation were essential tools in the response to issues identified, with 27,000 people of concern provided with counselling and legal aid.\n\nWhile asylum applications in the region increased by 19% from 2018, most applicants abandoned procedures before receiving a decision.\n\nAt the regional level, UNHCR maintained its proactive advocacy on legislation, policy, and procedures affecting asylum access.\n\nIt reviewed the implementation of its\n\n\"Fair and fast\" discussion paper, which outlined concrete steps for establishing accelerated and simplified asylum procedures in the European Union.\n\nQuality Initiative:\n\nWorking together to improve asylum\n\n\"Fair and Fast:\n\nUNHCR Discussion\n\nPaper on\n\nAccelerated and\n\nSimplified\n\nProcedures in the\n\nEuropean Union\"\n\nUNHCR supported the improvement of reception conditions in areas receiving high numbers of arrivals, such as Cyprus, Greece, Malta and South-Eastern Europe.\n\nWorking with national authorities, it promoted safe and dignified reception conditions, addressed critical protection needs and ensured access to services and information.\n\nRegion-wide, 123,441 asylum-seekers received information on government status determination procedures.\n\nDespite close cooperation with governments and partners to enhance and maintain minimum standards, reception conditions remained concerning with overcrowding in many countries. On the Greek islands,\n\n36,435 asylum-seekers lived in poor conditions in informal settlements. Some\n\n$133 million in cash assistance, including\n\n* Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999)\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 129 multi-purpose grants, was essential in supporting the immediate needs of more than 227,471 refugees and asylum-seekers across Europe, particularly in Greece.\n\nWelcome: working for refugee\n\nMore than a quarter (27%) of all arrivals to Europe were children (29,400), of which\n\n8,500 (29%) were unaccompanied or separated. In response, UNHCR supported the development of child-friendly information materials on asylum procedures and children's rights within the child protection systems of countries of asylum. Child participation in assessment processes was also actively promoted. In Italy,\n\nUNHCR partnered with the Ombudsperson for Children to facilitate joint participatory assessments with more than 200 unaccompanied children.\n\nIn Greece, a guardianship programme implemented with national authorities provided invaluable protection and care to more than 2,324 unaccompanied children. Only a small number of children found solutions through placement in semi-independent living or foster care, or through family reunification or relocation.\n\nAs such, UNHCR continued its advocacy for increased solidarity for this particularly vulnerable group.\n\nIn South-Eastern Europe, UNHCR and IOM provided psychological and social support, as well as safe shelter, to nearly 200 survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, while identification and referral mechanisms were established to support people at heightened risk.\n\nParticipatory and community-based approaches enhanced the protection and socioeconomic inclusion of refugees and asylum-seekers across Europe, with more than 50 refugee-led and community-based organizations supported to implement pilot projects focused on enhancing the protection, engagement and inclusion of people of concern. In Italy, PartecipAzione supported 26 refugee-led organizations to facilitate the participation of refugees in economic, social and cultural activities, with projects ranging from cultural tours and story-telling events to access to information and legal counselling.\n\nInvestments in the socioeconomic integration of refugees and migrants produced multiple examples of good practice in Europe. UNHCR's Welcome:\n\nWorking for Refugee Integration project-a multi-stakeholder partnership with the private sector, institutions and civil society organizations-promoted refugees' employment in Italy, with companies offering employment or paid 147 internships to refugees applying to the award in 2019. Private sector actors also offered refugees employment and training opportunities and promoted their economic inclusion by ensuring their participation in private sector forums in Estonia, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine. Private sector actors similarly contributed to the development of country-specific guides for refugee employment in Ireland, Malta and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn South-Eastern Europe, UNHCR also remained committed to facilitating durable solutions for the most vulnerable displaced populations in the region. In partnership with the OSCE, UNHCR supported the implementation of the Regional Housing\n\nProgramme (RHP), facilitating beneficiary selection processes and ensuring the sustainability of solutions. Since the launch of the RHP, 6,280 vulnerable displaced households have been supported with housing solutions, with 2,400 households receiving support in 2019 alone.\n\nIn Turkey, UNHCR worked closely with the Government to monitor the spontaneous voluntary return of refugees, while third-country solutions were pursued for the most vulnerable refugees. In 2019,\n\n17,552 submissions for resettlement were made to 18 countries, while there were 10,558 departures. To boost their access to the labour market, 3,571 Syrian refugees were supported to enroll in formal national institutions for certified skills training in Turkey.\n\nEuropean States also showed solidarity with host countries by receiving resettled refugees, with a total of 33,824 submissions and 29,027 departures to Europe in 2019. France, Germany, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom received the highest number of refugees, with over\n\n22,000 resettled to these five countries and solutions strategy for Ukraine,\n\n2018-2022\", UNHCR supported durable solutions for IDPs and conflict-affected individuals through the rehabilitation of 1,330 damaged homes, providing\n\n2,666 people with long-term and permanent housing solutions. Community-based initiatives led by 26 community groups, comprising IDPs and host community members, encouraged IDPs' integration and the peaceful coexistence of communities and resulted in the repair of community infrastructure damaged by the conflict.\n\nUNHCR continued to transition responsibilities for IDP legal assistance to national service providers through training and referrals to free legal aid centres. This resulted in 3,000 IDPs receiving primary and secondary legal aid-a 15% increase compared to 2018.\n\nPlans to transition Shelter and NFI Cluster coordination to government counterparts were delayed, however, due to rotation in government personnel. Efforts will continue in 2020.\n\nProtracted internal displacement remained a concern in Eastern Europe. UNHCR collaborated with governments in support of IDPs' rights and solutions, including to the right to return home in safety and dignity.\n\nUNHCR's advocacy saw positive developments for IDP voting and housing rights. The Ukrainian Parliament amended the electoral code, giving IDPs the right to vote in local elections, while the\n\nGovernment increased funds for an affordable housing programme that addressed the needs of at least 785 IDP families in 2019.\n\nIn Ukraine, some 734,000 people continued to be internally displaced. Those living along the contact line between government and non-government-controlled areas were most affected by risks to their physical security, movement restrictions and the suspension of social benefits. In line with the \"Multi-year, multi-partner protection\n\nWith the strengthening of IDPs' access to national services in government-controlled areas, UNHCR focused its work in locations with high needs and fewer service providers, including along the contact line.

Notably, a pilot voluntary relocation programme enabled 14 families to relocate away from dangerous areas close to the contact line.\n\nUNHCR-UNICEF joint coalition on every child's right to a nationality\n\nAffected communities helped UNHCR, authorities and partner organizations identify and protect stateless persons and populations most at risk. For example, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, members of the Roma community worked with UNHCR, municipal authorities and legal aid partners to identify and support people in obtaining birth registration and confirming their citizenship. Of the 54 birth registrations it supported in 2019, 37 led to citizenship confirmation for Roma individuals.\n\nUNHCR continued collaborating with partners, including OSCE and the European\n\nNetwork on Statelessness, which led to the third OSCE-UNHCR practical seminar on sharing good practices on birth registration and childhood statelessness. To address childhood statelessness, the Latvian\n\nParliament passed a law providing automatic citizenship to children born to\n\n\"non-citizens\" of Latvia after 1 January 2020. A UNHCR-UNICEF advocacy brief on\n\n\"Ending childhood statelessness in Europe\" called on States and regional organizations to take urgent action to ensure no child was born, or remains, stateless in Europe.\n\nIn line with UNHCR's joint coalition with UNICEF on every child's right to a nationality, implementation strategies were developed and pursued in Albania,\n\nNorth Macedonia, Norway, and Serbia (and Kosovo: S/RES/1244 (1999)).\n\nThe Humanitarian Corridors for Refugees programme, which won the entry from\n\nEurope to UNHCR's Nansen Refugee\n\nAward, is a unique partnership between\n\nItalian faith-based organizations and UNHCR. Together with the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and the Interior, the\n\nCommunity of Sant'Egidio, Caritas Italiana, the Federation of Evangelical Churches in Italy and the Waldensian Table supported refugees resettled in Italy to rebuild their lives. Refugees were hosted in apartments, participated in language courses and received social assistance and legal support, all through the private funds of the organizations that manage the programme. At the end of 2019, more than 2,000 vulnerable people had been transferred to Italy as part of the programme, mainly Syrian and Eritrean refugees from Lebanon and Ethiopia, respectively. Such sponsorship programmes represent a critical lifeline to extremely vulnerable refugees who cannot rebuild their lives in a host country or return home.\n\nResearch on care arrangements for unaccompanied and separated children\n\nUNHCR, along with IOM and UNICEF, collaborated with the Lumos Foundation to map alternative care arrangements for in Bulgaria, France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. This process highlighted challenges and positive practices regarding the reception of unaccompanied children arriving in Europe.\n\nGiven the concerns around institutional care identified through this research, concrete recommendations have been made on the importance of alternative family and community-based care arrangements. Looking ahead to 2020 and building on positive practices in Greece and the Netherlands, UNHCR will continue to work closely with sister agencies and national authorities to strengthen appropriate care arrangements for unaccompanied and separated children, including foster care and supported independent living.\n\n© UNHCR/Socrates Baltagiannis\n\nHumanitarian\n\nCorridors: Nansen\n\nRefugee Award winner for Europe\n\nWith some 528,000 stateless persons in the region, UNHCR supported governments, lawmakers and civil society actors in the search for solutions. The\n\nStatelessness saw 40 pledges by European countries, including the adoption of laws preventing statelessness at birth, improving access to civil registration and documentation, establishing procedures to identify and protect stateless persons, and accessions to the statelessness conventions. Malta and North Macedonia delivered on their commitments, with Malta acceding to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and\n\nNorth Macedonia to the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness (on 3 January 2020).\n\nLesvos football team is dream come true for Congolese teenager\n\nThroughout his childhood, wherever he was, Francis played football.

Millions of refugees benefit from the lifesaving support provided thanks to their funding.\n\nIn 2019, the support from both lotteries amounted to more than $5 million, combining an annual core unearmarked contribution and project-based grants focusing on supporting refugee education and improved sustainability.\n\nEXPENDITURE IN EUROPE 2015-2019 | USD\n\nIn other operations, UNHCR continued to rely on flexible funding to respond effectively to emerging and protracted needs across Europe.

UNHCR engaged with\n\nQatar on its asylum legislation after the\n\nGovernment adopted a national asylum framework, following its accessions to the\n\nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nUNHCR conducted refugee status determination (RSD) in many of the region's countries and supported the gradual transition of RSD to national authorities in others. In 2019, 6,797,653 people of concern were registered on an individual basis across the region-3% more than in\n\n2018-while 1,971,319 (29%) people were biometrically registered, slightly more than the 1,324,929 in 2018. With the detention of asylum-seekers and refugees commonplace in several countries, UNHCR advocated to end child detention and find alternatives, in line with its global strategy \"Beyond detention\" (2014-2019). In Libya, UNHCR registered some 3,400 people of concern through monitoring visits to detention centres and, through its intervention, 1,800 people in need of international protection were released from detention in 2019.\n\nTo integrate mental health and psychosocial support services (MHPSS) into its protection response, UNHCR developed a MHPSS strategy for many operations, including Yemen. More than 150 UNHCR and partner frontline staff were trained in psychological first aid across the region.\n\nOther countries, including Algeria, Egypt,\n\nIraq, Lebanon and Turkey strengthened their MHPSS by designating UNHCR operational focal points, providing capacity-building for non-mental health experts on scalable psychological interventions, and promoting MHPSS integration within interventions. Improving the protection response for persons with disabilities, UNHCR coordinated \"Power of inclusion: Mapping the protection responses for persons with disabilities among refugees in the Middle East and\n\nNorth Africa region\", a regional study on persons with disabilities, to be used for future planning and to advocate integrated programming.\n\nPower of\n\nPower of Inclusion\n\nMapping the Protection Responses for Persons with Disabilities\n\nAmong Refugees in the Middle East and North Africa Region\n\nNovember 2019\n\nGuidance notes, specialized training and capacity development resulted in enhanced child protection, including child asylum claims for operations in North Africa, and some 5,410 unaccompanied or separated children had a best interests assessment initiated or completed. Protection interventions were strengthened by leveraging broader partnerships for technical and financial support, as well as through stronger engagement with civil society and the private sector. Protection from sexual exploitation and abuse measures were incorporated into UNHCR's partner selection procedures, and in project design and monitoring. Some community centres operated across 400 the region with 4,200 community volunteers facilitating social support and access to tailored services for women, girls, men and boys.\n\nConflicts and emergencies in Iraq, Libya,\n\nSyria and Yemen meant the scale, severity and complexity of humanitarian needs remained extensive. UNHCR implemented\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 143\n\n3RP in Response to the Syria Crisis\n\nEmergency Transit\n\nMechanism in preparedness measures, and supported operations in strengthening their presence and emergency response with lifesaving, multi-sectoral assistance, including protection services, shelter, basic relief items, multi-purpose cash and health assistance. UNHCR enhanced its leadership in refugee emergency responses, particularly through the 3RP, illustrating the progress that can be made when the Global Compact on Refugees is applied in practice, and provided assistance to IDPs with its lead in protection, shelter/NFI and CCCM clusters.\n\nIt also coordinated with Humanitarian or\n\nUN Country Teams to address the protection dimensions of displacement crises.\n\nResponding to the most urgent lifesaving needs, UNHCR provided nearly $407.7 million in cash assistance to more than 2.9 million refugees and displaced people, particularly in urban settings.\n\nSome $269.3 million-worth of core relief items supported more than 1.3 million refugees and IDPs in the Syria situation, and at least 619,500 people were provided with shelter assistance while 61% of households were living in adequate dwellings.\n\nCash grants made rental accommodation possible for 84,588 households.\n\nLifesaving mechanisms for humanitarian evacuation, resettlement, voluntary repatriation, reunification, and other solutions were expanded to Italy,\n\nNiger, Romania and Rwanda including via the Emergency Transit Mechanisms/\n\nEmergency Transit Centres. In all, people evacuated from Libya were 878 processed through the mechanism in Niger; people were evacuated to Italy; 393 to Romania; and 306 to Rwanda, 452 where the first seven evacuees later departed for resettlement.\n\nUNHCR's work with the new chairs of the\n\nPriority Situations Core Group-Ireland and Sweden-was important in achieving the increase in resettlement submissions.\n\nWork consisted of sharing good practices, demonstrating the strategic impact of resettlement and identifying durable solutions to ensure strong partnerships and collaboration in key ongoing resettlement programmes, such as in the Syria and Central Mediterranean situations.\n\nPrimary, secondary and tertiary education inclusive of people of concern was encouraged for children and young people.\n\nDuring 2019, 432,328 children were enrolled in primary school-a 12% increase compared to 2018. Meanwhile, 64,347 were enrolled in secondary school-nearly a third more than in 2018. Under UNHCR's\n\nDAFI scholarship programme, 3,458 youth also received tertiary education grants.\n\nUNHCR promoted the economic inclusion of those who had been forced to flee their homes, advocating their right to work and earn a livelihood, and 34% of refugees were self-employed for more than 12 months or owned a business by the end of 2019.\n\nIn 2019, UNHCR verified 95,000 refugee returns to Syria from neighbouring countries, representing an annual increase of 75%. In UNHCR's latest regional intention survey, which excluded Turkey, more than 75% of Syrian refugees in the region expressed a hope to return one day, while only around 6% intended to return in the coming year.\n\nWith more than 5.5 million Syrian refugees hosted in neighbouring countries, and to mitigate the reduction of global resettlement allocations observed in and 2018, UNHCR encouraged 2017 new resettlement programmes and the expansion of existing ones as a means of responsibility-sharing with host countries.\n\nThere were 41,516 refugees submitted for resettlement from the region (including\n\n17,552 from Turkey), an 11% increase on submissions. The largest number of 2018 referred refugees was from Syria (29,562), with almost 4,656 from Afghanistan and\n\n2,443 from Iraq (most of whom were referred from Turkey). Some 20,036 refugees were resettled from the region, as well as a further 10,558 from Turkey, a slight increase compared to 2018 departures.\n\nIn Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Yemen, more than million people were internally displaced 11 by violence, many multiple times. Across the emergencies, UNHCR led protection, shelter/NFI and CCCM clusters or sectors.\n\nThe IDP response took a community-based approach, with UNHCR and partners aiming to empower communities to obtain their rights safely and in dignity, while reducing their vulnerabilities. Outreach platforms-a network of community and satellite centres with mobile teams and volunteers linked to national NGOs- enhanced UNHCR's coverage. Given the security situation and difficulties accessing populations in need, this approach was instrumental in consulting and facilitating communities' participation in designing and shaping an evidence-based response across sectors, that achieved better protection, improved lives and found solutions.\n\n©ILO\n\nMore than 148,000 people accessed primary health care and nutrition assistance while around 500,000 people were assisted with clean drinking water and adequate sanitation. About 92% of people of concern had access to national and/or government primary health facilities. UNHCR strengthened sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) prevention, risk mitigation mainstreaming and response across all operations. There were 16,744 SGBV incidents reported, for which survivors received psychosocial counselling. Furthermore, region-wide, survivors received legal assistance 790 and 1,895 survivors accessed medical help.\n\nImproving and empowering refugees to access decent work in Jordan\n\nEmployment service centres were established inside the Zaatari refugee camp in 2017 and Azraq refugee camp in 2018. The centres were the result of work done by UNHCR with ILO in coordination with the Government of Jordan, and sponsored by the Dutch Government.\n\nThe centres provide refugees with counselling services on employment, work permits, and help them leave the camps to attend job fairs where they can meet employers and gain access to formal work opportunities across Jordan. This new leave system also provided refugees with increased protection and allowed them to take up job opportunities anywhere in the country within specified sectors.\n\nTo date, 13 employment centres have helped some 10,000 people, both Jordanians and Syrians, to obtain employment and training opportunities, as well as other services.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 145\n\nIn Yemen, UNHCR assisted nearly\n\n168,000 IDP families and vulnerable host community members with cash assistance; gave more than 86,000 families core relief items, such as bedding, kitchen sets and solar lamps; and distributed shelter kits to more than 17,000 families.\n\nIn Libya, UNHCR aimed to strengthen advocacy and promote IDPs' access to rights, basic services and solutions.\n\nIncreased hostilities in Tripoli from April displaced 150,000 Libyans. UNHCR 2019 activated its emergency IDP response, reaching 1,086 IDP and IDP returnee households with multi-purpose cash assistance and distributing 9,785 shelter kits to IDPs in eastern Libya. By increasing its outreach capacity and expanding its partnerships, it conducted protection monitoring, identified needs and guided effective responses.\n\nIn Syria, despite operational challenges, UNHCR reached more than 1.7 million people with protection activities, including\n\n236,000 with specific child protection activities and more than 300,000 with SGBV services. Around 1.8 million people also received basic relief items; more than\n\n520,000 people had shelter support; and some 428,000 people accessed health assistance. Working cross-border from\n\nTurkey, UNHCR also provided basic relief items and shelter support to more than\n\n358,000 people and reached over\n\n153,200 people with protection services through referrals, awareness raising and psychological support.\n\nIn Iraq, more than 47,000 IDPs and returnees received legal assistance through UNHCR and at least 36,600 IDPs and returnees secured civil documentation. UNHCR also provided cash assistance to vulnerable IDP families, both as monthly cash support for those living outside camps and through winter assistance. UNHCR's winter assistance programme provided cash assistance to more than 64,200 IDP families. It also distributed core relief items to more than 33,300 families in camps and urban areas. Meanwhile, UNHCR shelter interventions focused on improving the living conditions of IDPs in camps throughout Iraq and supporting returnees in their place of origin.\n\nWith some 371,000 stateless persons in the region, initiatives were in line with the regional strategic approach on the prevention and reduction of statelessness.\n\nIn particular, initiatives built on the momentum created by the 2019 League of Arab States' Declaration on Belonging and Legal Identity, reinforced in the\n\nLeague of Arab States' Arab Strategy for the Protection of Refugee Children.\n\nUNHCR also worked closely with States in preparation for the October 2019\n\nHigh-Level Segment on Statelessness, with dedicated support to Mauritania resulting in the submission of four pledges during the event.\n\nCourses on statelessness for government officials strengthened awareness of international standards and provided a platform for States to share experiences and explore possible solutions and innovations. In Iraq, significant reductions in statelessness were sustained through legal aid. In 2019, 262 cases were resolved in Iraq through the acquisition and confirmation of nationality, with a total of 2,733 cases since 2015. In the 3RP context, interventions by UNHCR and partners significantly reduced the percentage of Syrian refugee children born in the region each year without identity documents, such as a birth certificate or medical birth notification.\n\nThe percentage fell from approximately 35% in 2012 to 1.8% in 2018, the last year for which data is available.\n\nThe Middle East and North Africa Civil\n\nSociety Network for Displacement became the principal regional platform for civil society national actors. The first regional\n\nNGO consultations in Amman, Jordan, held in association with the network, saw around 200 partners embracing the \"whole-of-society\" approach.\n\nThe consultations provided a platform for regional actors to amplify advocacy and present joint commitments to displacement prevention, response, and solutions.\n\nIn Tunisia, for instance, civil society actors played a leading role in advocating and providing essential services to people of concern. The actors created a network of expertise, building the capacities of government officials and decision makers, by conducting training sessions on the international protection of refugees and asylum-seekers for representatives of ministries and government bodies.\n\nEngagement with regional academia was another successful example of the pioneering outreach in the region, aligned with the Global Compact on Refugees.\n\nThink tanks, research centres, universities and professors supported building a culture of evidence-based policy making on displacement. At the first and second academic roundtable discussions in\n\nAmman, Jordan, partners highlighted the important role that academic institutions can play in conducting research on issues related to displacement and building databases and scientific bases for policies and operations to advance refugees' rights.\n\nProgress was achieved in linking academia with policy-makers through follow-up on the creation of the first regional Arabic\n\nJournal of Refugee Studies, which will also support practitioners in the field.\n\nAcross the region, chronic underfunding affected all operations. With overall funding less than half (46%) of what was needed, critical lifesaving and protection services remained unmet in 2019.\n\nNorth Africa Civil\n\nSociety Network for Displacement\n\nThe highest gaps were faced in Syria, where accessing people of concern regularly and delivering quality protection services faced significant resource-related constraints, as well as those engendered by the insecurity.\n\nThis was particularly relevant in the remote\n\nGovernorates of Aleppo, Deir-ez-Zour, Idleb and Raqqa. UNHCR's plans to expand its outreach network by opening 28 new community centres did not materialize, leaving 560,000 IDPs without protection services.\n\nGiven the scale of the crisis, Yemen remained one of the region's most underfunded operations. In 2019, more than 900,000 Yemenis, considered to be the most vulnerable of its internally displaced population, found refuge in one of 1,700 IDP hosting sites. However, underfunding of the CCCM Cluster meant the services offered were limited or sporadic.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 147\n\nIn Jordan, limited funds meant the operation was unable to assist nearly\n\n10,000 households of the 41,700 families targeted with cash assistance. Similarly, in Lebanon, UNHCR was only able to reach 42% of the 84,000 vulnerable\n\nSyrian refugee families targeted with regular cash assistance.\n\nIn Iraq, UNHCR had to prioritize 59% of\n\nIDP families for winter assistance, leaving significant needs unmet in areas where more than 4 million people had returned\n\nDifficult decisions had to be taken in refugee camps like Tindouf (Algeria) or\n\nMbera (Mauritania), where funding was redirected from critical infrastructural investments toward lifesaving interventions.\n\nChallenges faced by urban refugees and asylum-seekers in countries such as\n\nEgypt or Morocco were amplified by increased costs of living, exposing them to higher risks, such as exploitation and forced labour.\n\nEXPENDITURE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH

foster the full enjoyment of fundamental rights in response to the legal, physical and material needs of people of concern to UNHCR.\n\nProtection work in 2019 was challenged by the increased complexity and scale of cross-border and internal displacement, but the year also saw significant protection achievements.\n\nMany States took action to improve national asylum systems, seeking to ensure the fairness, efficiency, adaptability and integrity of their laws and policy frameworks.\n\nThe Asylum Capacity Support Group (ACSG), launched at the Global Refugee Forum, was a catalyst for action with more than 50 States pledging to strengthen their asylum systems or extend support to other States to do so.\n\nUNHCR provided guidance and practical tools to encourage compliance with international standards and facilitated the engagement of a wide range of stakeholders including law firms who pledged a significant number of pro bono hours in support of protection objectives at the Forum.\n\nThe principle of responsibility-sharing in the provision of protection and solutions also underpinned the High-Level Segment on Statelessness.

Advocacy addressing the importance of safety and dignity for sustainable voluntary repatriation was only moderately successful, with protracted conflict and neglect of underlying root causes for flight remaining significant obstacles to return.

As a result, Sweden now accords refugees the same treatment as nationals with respect to State pensions.\n\nStates parties to the 1951 Convention and/or its 1967 Protocol are obliged to cooperate with UNHCR and to provide the Office with relevant information on the implementation of these instruments. As such, UNHCR continued to seek improvements to domestic laws and policies relating to the treatment of refugees, ensuring their compliance with international law.\n\nIn 2019, UNHCR issued detailed comments on law and policy proposals in 24 countries.\n\nUNHCR supported the development of national frameworks on internal displacement by providing legal and technical advice in 11 States, including\n\nEl Salvador (which adopted its IDP law in\n\nJanuary 2020), Ethiopia, Honduras, Liberia, Mali, Mexico and South Sudan. The Office continued to advocate for the participation and consultation of affected communities when developing such instruments, for example in South Sudan.

For instance, of the countries which saw the adoption of laws 34 and legislative changes to their international protection framework, 9 of these (26%) involved some restrictions to refugees' rights.\n\nLastly, in some countries, electoral processes or other national political developments delayed progress on the enactment of legal instruments and amendments in 2019.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 157\n\nIDENTIFYING INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION NEEDS\n\nAND NATIONAL ASYLUM SYSTEMS\n\n© UNHCR/Jaime Giménez Sánchez de la Blanca\n\nAhead of the implementation of new visa laws, UNHCR staff at the Rumichaca International Bridge provide information, legal assistance, water and aid items to Venezuelan refugees and migrants crossing from Colombia into Ecuador.\n\n2.3 million individual new and appeal asylum applications were registered globally and\n\nStates and territories implemented national 121 asylum procedures\n\nStates pledged to strengthen their national asylum systems at the Global Refugee Forum, specifically regarding fairness, efficiency, adaptability and integrity\n\nOf this number 120,400 new individual asylum applications were registered by UNHCR, accounting for 5% of the total asylum and related trends, see\n\nChapter 4 of the\n\nTrends report\n\nStates in which UNHCR strategically engaged with refugee status determination procedures, in accordance with its mandate\n\nProtection is a State responsibility and the existence of fully functioning national asylum/refugee status determination (RSD) systems operating with fairness, efficiency, adaptability and integrity are crucial. for coordinated efforts to develop\n\nThe official launch of the Asylum Capacity\n\nSupport Group (ACSG) at the Global\n\nRefugee Forum created new momentum developed guidance and practical tools to national asylum capacities and further State responsibility in receiving countries.\n\nIn consultation with States, civil society organizations and others, UNHCR help them prepare pledges in this area.\n\nUsing the Forum as a focus, UNHCR's work with States led to around 58 pledging to develop or strengthen existing national asylum systems. It also saw the Office supporting other States in their efforts.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Forum, several States made welcome efforts to streamline their asylum systems, in line with UNHCR's country guidance. Examples included\n\nMexico's decision to apply simplified procedures for cases involving certain profiles with high recognition rates;\n\nBrazil's move to recognize thousands of\n\nVenezuelan asylum-seekers as refugees on a prima facie basis; and Malawi's prima facie declaration of refugee status for certain groups of asylum-seekers from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\n\nWhether individually or collectively, many civil society organizations and private law firms also pledged to support efforts in this area by, for example, providing free legal advice and representation, training, research and interpreters. A portion of the legal community's joint pledge at the Forum for 125,000 hours of free legal aid per year is expected to be operational as of 2020.\n\nHigh-quality country of origin information and UNHCR country guidance are the starting points for identifying international protection needs and are therefore at the heart of improving the efficiency and quality of policy and decision making in national asylum systems. In 2019, UNHCR produced and commissioned country of origin information reports on major countries of origin and issued country guidance on the DRC, Iraq, Mali, South Sudan, and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).\n\nIn addition, UNHCR's country-specific guidance was presented to a range of different first-instance decision makers, including judges, tribunal members, lawyers, legal aid providers and other experts at the national, regional\n\n(European Asylum Support Office,\n\nQuality Assurance Initiatives) and global levels (Inter-Governmental Consultations, Priority Situations Core Group).\n\nIn 2019, close to 1.3 million substantive RSD decisions were made globally.\n\nUNHCR also completed the review and update of its \"Procedural standards for\n\nRSD under UNHCR's mandate\" and rolled out the new RSD learning programme.\n\nAs well, 483 learners, including partner staff and State officials, completed\n\nUNHCR's e-learning modules on RSD and country of origin information.\n\nIn addition, 293 individuals benefited from the continued roll-out of UNHCR's interview learning programme.\n\nWhile the ACSG is expected to progressively improve the asylum landscape, challenges and gaps related to the institutional or technical components of national asylum systems remain.

It also sought to encourage action by governments, civil society and other entities to promote and protect the human rights of people of concern to UNHCR.\n\nKey achievements linked to UNHCR's engagement with human rights processes included several Special Rapporteurs taking up the Office's calls for States to improve asylum systems and encouraging the concerned governments to strengthen asylum-seeker registration, legal aid services, accommodation and freedom of movement standards. Among other positive outcomes, vulnerable families were released from detention in a transit zone following coordinated advocacy with a special procedures mandate holder.\n\nUNHCR also regularly engaged with the\n\nUN human rights treaty bodies, raising protection considerations affecting people of concern under each of the treaties.\n\nIt held eight strategic meetings with the\n\nOHCHR Secretariat supporting the treaty bodies and provided two statements and one thematic briefing to treaty body committees. These measures strengthened the channels of collaboration between\n\nUNHCR and treaty bodies, as well as their attentiveness to emerging human rights issues affecting people of concern.\n\nIn addition, UNHCR held strategic meetings related to 13 different special procedure mandate holders, identifying common synergies between mandates and proactively identifying priority issues and\n\nStates for forthcoming country visits or annual reports, to which UNHCR could contribute expert advice and support.\n\nUNHCR also established and expanded existing channels for the exchange of information with the special procedures on individual cases, facilitating the sharing of information on such cases, where appropriate, and enabling their advocacy and action on behalf of people of concern, including those at risk of refoulement.\n\nUNHCR reached out to a variety of stakeholders from NGOs, national human rights institutions and academia to strengthen partnerships, expand outreach and advocacy opportunities, and create opportunities to exchange on human rights. It also sought to strengthen existing linkages with OHCHR and other UN agencies. Developing and strengthening partnerships in the field of human rights helped identify new opportunities to ensure the mainstreaming of protection issues for people of concern.\n\nThese included providing input to guidance prepared by UN sister agencies, as well as working on joint capacity-building initiatives to raise issues related to forced displacement and statelessness in international and regional normative human rights frameworks and leveraging the existing work of other stakeholders.\n\nUNHCR also participated in the UN Task\n\nTeam on civic space, which is developing guidance and a UN system-wide strategy on promoting, expanding and protecting civic space and addressing cases of reprisal.\n\nHuman rights are a sensitive issue with certain States and dialogue around measures to safeguard the rights of people of concern, or redress threatened or actual violations, did not, in all cases, lead to swift action in 2019. This included situations in which obstacles derived not from lack of political will, but from limited resources, institutional capacity, and/or lack of strong systems to guarantee the rule of law.\n\nIn other contexts, populist anti-foreigner rhetoric or sentiment also limited UNHCR's capacity to ensure that the rights of people of concern were guaranteed in practice.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 161\n\nADDRESSING AND RESPONDING TO MIXED MOVEMENTS\n\n© UNHCR/Gordon Welters\n\nPiles of lifejackets used by refugees and migrants to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece at a dumping ground near Molyvos, on the Greek island of Lesvos.\n\nSea arrivals to Italy and the estimated number of dead and missing people along that route decreased by almost 50% compared to 2018 people in need of international protection evacuated from Libya including through\n\nEmergency Transit Mechanisms/Centres\n\nThe year saw continuing mixed movements, with refugees in search of international protection moving alongside migrants, often sharing the same routes and the same dangers. Migration along dangerous sea and land routes was driven in many cases by the lack of opportunities for migrants to move legally, such as through labour mobility schemes. It was also driven by migrants' expectations of conditions in intended destination countries, encouraged by the rhetoric of smugglers and, in some cases, diaspora communities.\n\nWith 2019 the first year of the implementation of the Global Compact on Refugees (GCR) and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM), UNHCR provided guidance on how the GCR and its architecture of support could be applicable to situations of mixed movements. The\n\nOffice engaged with the UN Network on\n\nMigration, as a member of its executive committee, to develop guidance and tools supporting Member States' implementation of the GCM.\n\nIrregular, dangerous movements through the Central Mediterranean route continued.\n\nHowever, sea arrivals to Italy, and the estimated number of dead and missing people along that route, decreased by almost 50% compared to 2018.\n\nUNHCR in promoted respect for international protection principles in rescue and interception at sea, including through judicial engagement and collaboration with partners, such as the International Maritime Organization. This contributed to disembarkation schemes for refugees and migrants, facilitated by agreements on the distribution of asylum-seekers among different countries.\n\nAcross the Central and West Mediterranean\n\nUNHCR cooperated with more than\n\nStates of origin, transit and destination 15 in sub-Saharan and North Africa to strengthen presence, protection and solutions, including resettlement opportunities for people of concern on the move. A key part of UNHCR's strategic response was the use of resettlement and, in the case of Libya, humanitarian evacuations of individuals in need of international protection including through\n\nEmergency Transit Mechanisms or\n\nEmergency Transit Centres to Italy, Niger, Romania and Rwanda. In total\n\n2,029 refugees were evacuated from\n\nLibya in 2019: 393 to Italy, 878 to Niger, to Romania and 306 to Rwanda. 452\n\nUNHCR also strengthened access to family reunification activities for children at risk through the pilot project \"Live, Learn and Participate\". In total, 597 cases were identified in Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya and\n\nSudan, 129 of which were formally assessed and 64 referred for legal services.\n\nCountering the role of human traffickers in the often-dangerous movements of people of concern to UNHCR and migrants,\n\nUNHCR intensified efforts with partners, including IOM, UNODC, the Task Team of the Global Protection Cluster on Trafficking and the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking in Persons. Such efforts included the development of practical tools and guidance, including the UNHCR-IOM framework to develop standard operating procedures to facilitate the identification and protection of victims of trafficking.\n\nThey also analyzed gaps in protection and assistance for victims of trafficking, including in refugee settings and situations of internal displacement. UNHCR delivered training on asylum and migration-related topics, including the Mixed Movement\n\nLearning Programme, to increase meaningful engagement by staff and partners in protection work for refugees and responses to migration that reflect human rights standards and effective, principled migration management strategies.\n\nThe complexity and scale of challenges in the area of asylum and migration require strategic, multi-actor responses.\n\nAs conditions and mobility patterns evolved in different parts of the world in\n\n2019, up-to-date information and analytical capacity were needed, alongside resources to develop and advise States and other partners on responses. This required specialist resources that could be adapted continuously and expertise in UNHCR's field operations, bureaux and Headquarters.\n\nIn an environment where many competing priorities exist for UNHCR, ensuring scope for these proved challenging.\n\nSEA ARRIVALS TO ITALY COMPARED\n\nTO ESTIMATED NUMBER OF DEAD\n\nAND MISSING PEOPLE ALONG\n\nTHE ROUTE | 2014 -2019\n\n4,000\n\nSea arrivals\n\nDead and missing\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 163\n\nALTERNATIVES TO DETENTION\n\n© UNHCR/Mohamed Alalem\n\nLegislative reform, new regulations and effective partnerships led to the piloting of new alternatives to detention in several focus countries, including Canada,\n\nIndonesia, Mexico, Lithuania and the United Kingdom. Several of these programmes allow community-based solutions to be developed, in partnership with civil society.\n\nConditions of detention that meet international standards\n\nImmigration detention monitoring was strengthened in a number of countries, including Indonesia, North Macedonia and South Africa.\n\nVulnerable refugees prepare for evacuation from Libya to Rwanda.\n\nAcross the 20 focus countries, UNHCR's \"Global strategy - beyond detention 2014-2019\" was instrumental in:\n\nSecuring legal and policy developments aimed at improving detention safeguards and developing alternatives to detention\n\nPassing or introducing laws that limited or ended the immigration detention of asylum-seeking and refugee children\n\nThe end of 2019 marked the finalization of UNHCR's \"Global strategy - beyond detention 2014-2019\". Important progress was made in its 20 focus countries across the three goals of ending child detention; ensuring alternatives to detention are available to asylum-seekers; and promoting conditions of detention that meet international standards.\n\nEnding child detention\n\nMost of the 20 participating countries passed laws or introduced high-level policy\n\nStrengthening immigration detention monitoring decisions limiting or ending the immigration detention of asylum-seeking and refugee children. Such prohibitions are now legally enshrined in Canada, Malta, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Non-detention of asylum-seeking and refugee children is also the practice in Israel, Lithuania and Zambia. Bulgaria, Malaysia and\n\nMexico made progress towards providing special protection and assistance for including appropriate care arrangements and the introduction of child-sensitive screening and referral procedures.\n\nIn addition to concrete achievements in focus countries, the Global Strategy served to consolidate clear and consistent protection messages regarding the detention of asylum-seekers and other people of concern. It also provided a strong platform for dialogue, capacity-building, practical cooperation and advocacy with governments and other key stakeholders in implementing countries. Similarly, it fostered the development of a capacitated and engaged global community of practice.\n\nWhile the Global Strategy came to a formal conclusion at the end of 2019, UNHCR will continue to pursue its three key goals and build on its achievements and momentum.\n\nIn doing so, UNHCR will capitalize on the regionalization of its bureaux to anchor detention work closer to the field, and maintain the partnerships established or strengthened in 2019 at global, regional and country level.\n\nMore broadly, developing and strengthening a wide range of partnerships was crucial in implementing the Strategy. At a global level, this included the renewal of the memorandum of understanding between\n\nUNHCR and the International Detention\n\nCoalition (IDC), reaffirming each actor's commitment to promoting effective alternatives to detention and to working together in the fields of monitoring, research, advocacy and capacity-building. In addition,\n\nUNHCR assumed co-leadership, along with\n\nIDC and UNICEF, of the Working Group on\n\nAlternatives to Detention set up under the umbrella of the UN Network on Migration.\n\nThe working group will focus on consolidating good practices and common positions and guidelines, as well as establishing a government peer-learning platform to improve States' capacity to develop and use alternatives to migration detention.\n\nAs a member of the advisory board to the\n\nUN global study on children deprived of liberty, UNHCR provided input and practical examples to the report, which was presented, along with recommendations, to the United Nations General Assembly in October 2019.\n\nDespite progress, immigration detention of children remains a challenge in many countries, including in border and transit zones, during the asylum procedure and in the context of return procedures.\n\nExacerbating this challenge, accurate global-level data on immigration-related detention is unavailable, for children or adults, as administrative records are limited in many immigration contexts and appropriate systems for data collection often do not exist nationally.\n\nWhile alternatives to detention have been introduced in several countries, discrepancies between legislation and practice persist, creating uncertainty for asylum-seekers and challenges to judicial oversight. In several countries, conditions of detention fall short of international standards and intermingling of asylum-seekers with criminal offenders remains a problem.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 165\n\nStates parties to the 1954 Statelessness Convention, and 74 States parties to the 1961 Convention, compared to 83 and 61 respectively at the start of the #IBelong Campaign in 2014\n\nStates established dedicated statelessness determination procedures, compared to 9 at the start of the #IBelong Campaign\n\n81,074\n\nStates reported reliable quantitative data on stateless persons, compared to 77 at individuals who were formerly stateless confirmed, compared to 37,100 at the start of the #IBelong Campaign saw some of the most significant 2019 progress in preventing and resolving statelessness since 2014. The granting of nationality to some 81,100 stateless persons represented the key achievement of 2019. The Kyrgyz Republic became the first country to resolve all known cases of statelessness on its territory, having persons over the last five years. This remarkable achievement can be attributed to the close collaboration between government authorities, civil society organizations and UN agencies and illustrates what can be done when political will is matched with dedicated support.\n\nConsiderable progress was also made in other countries in Central Asia, such as in Tajikistan, where a large statelessness identification and reduction programme is underway following the example of the Kyrgyz Republic.

These pledges gave a strong boost to the #IBelong\n\nCampaign and the implementation of the accompanying Global Action Plan to End Statelessness.\n\nDeepening existing partnerships to address statelessness, UNHCR worked with the World Bank on a groundbreaking new study on the socioeconomic implications of statelessness among the Shona minority group in Kenya. The\n\n\"Friends of the #IBelong Campaign\", a group of States represented by their\n\nGeneva-based Permanent Missions, raised awareness on the issue of statelessness, including through their participation in the Universal Periodic Review.

Current statistics cover only countries, with 4.2 million stateless 76 persons captured. With the true global figure estimated to be significantly higher, a key priority in 2019 was to improve data on statelessness. Working to remedy this, UNHCR supported studies on statelessness in Côte d'Ivoire and Mali, while questions on statelessness featured for the first time in censuses in Kenya and Niger.\n\nIn 2019, there were four accessions to the UN Statelessness Conventions, with many States pledging to accede to the\n\nConventions in 2020 and throughout the remainder of the #IBelong Campaign.\n\nUNHCR's advocacy to address statelessness was negatively affected by the rise of xenophobia and pernicious forms of nationalism in many parts of the world. Going forward, it will be critical to continue making the strongest possible case for inclusive societies and, specifically, the removal of discriminatory provisions in nationality laws, civil registration laws and related procedures and practices.\n\nRohingya refugees in Nayapara camp are registered using the Biometric Identity Management System (BIMS) in a joint exercise between UNHCR and the Government of Bangladesh.\n\nUnder a new measure enacted by the\n\nGovernment of Colombia, children born in\n\nColombia to Venezuelan parents are now granted Colombian nationality.

It facilitates access to basic assistance and protection and enables the early identification of individuals at heightened risk.

The interoperable use of\n\nPRIMES tools, including providing partners with secure access to data for continuity of identity in resettlement case management, digital distribution processes and biometric identity verification, has had tangible benefits. Incidents of misrepresentation, recycling and multiple distribution have been mitigated, leading to overall savings in assistance and assurance that aid is channeled and provided to beneficiaries.\n\nIn 2019, proGres v4 (UNHCR's web-based registration and case management database, and a key component of PRIMES) was deployed to an additional 28 country operations, taking the overall number using the tool to 73. As part of this, the records of 10.2 million individuals of concern to\n\nUNHCR were registered or migrated to the system, up from 4.1 million at the end of 2018.\n\nDATA\n\nTRANSFORMATION\n\nSTRATEGY\n\n2020-2025\n\nSupporting protection and\n\nINDIVIDUAL RECORDS REGISTERED BY\n\nUNHCR | 2015 -2019\n\nUNHCR's Data\n\nTransformation\n\nStrategy 10.4\n\nSeptember 2019\n\nIndividual records migrated/registered in proGres v4\n\nAdditionally, PRIMES' Biometric and\n\nIdentity Management System was rolled out to a further nine countries, taking to the number of operations biometrically 69 enrolling populations of concern, and the number of individual records to 8.8 million, up from 7.2 million at the end of 2018.\n\nUNHCR supported its field operations by providing training, negotiating data sharing agreements with partners and responding to emergencies. Eleven registration and data management specialists were deployed to emergencies in Bangladesh,\n\nCosta Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Niger and Rwanda. They supported the planning, preparation and implementation of emergency registration activities and facilitated refugee access to documentation, protection and assistance. To strengthen operations' capacities to carry out continuous registration, population verification and preparations for PRIMES tools, a roster was established with the\n\nDanish Refugee Council resulting in the deployment of seven registration specialists to Djibouti, the Democratic\n\nRepublic of the Congo, Israel, Malawi, the Republic of the Congo, and Rwanda. medical checks and departures were the same as those who, prior to entering the resettlement process, were originally registered by UNHCR's robust and proven procedures. This process, used for example by the Government of the United\n\nStates, will be expanded to other resettlement States in 2020.\n\nIn 2019, UNHCR strengthened its engagement with strategic partners to promote the inclusion of all people of concern to UNHCR, including those at risk of statelessness, in governments' digital identity management systems. It also promoted greater recognition of refugees' identity credentials to access public and private sector services, including financial services. It undertook an online consultation project, in partnership with the\n\nGovernment of Canada and a wide range of external partners, on how digital identity can provide greater opportunities for refugees and asylum-seekers, allowing them to better contribute to their host communities. The findings were presented at the Global Refugee Forum and are contributing to a five-year action plan, in line with UNHCR's \"Data transformation strategy 2020-2025\".\n\nInteroperability between PRIMES and the systems and databases of other humanitarian actors, including UNICEF and WFP, was slower than anticipated.\n\nAdditional interoperability resources, such as the Joint Excellence Hub and the\n\nUN Common Cash Statement will, however, become available in early 2020 to accelerate progress.\n\nOther PRIMES development initiatives had to be deprioritized in 2019 due to competing priorities. These initiatives included the centralization of UNHCR's\n\nGlobal Distribution Tool (GDT), which provides UNHCR and partners (including\n\nWFP) with secure access to its biometric database for identity verification purposes during aid distributions, for example. Other initiatives that were put on hold in 2019 included the developments of mobile applications for both BIMS and the GDT.\n\nThe Global\n\nVirtual Summit on Digital Identity for Refugees\n\nUNHCR also developed a secure platform to share biographic and biometric data with key resettlement countries, thereby improving the resettlement case submission process. In support of resettlement applications, UNHCR shared the biometric records of over\n\n25,000 people of concern with key resettlement States using this data transfer platform. This provided greater assurance that individuals undertaking interviews,\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 171\n\nAGE, GENDER AND DIVERSITY-INCLUSIVE PROGRAMMING\n\n© UNHCR/Aristophane Ngargoune\n\nUNHCR's AGD policy and its 10 core actions promote participation and non-discrimination, recognizing that each person of concern has unique capacities and priorities and faces different protection risks. Supporting the continued roll-out of the policy, a stock-taking and self-assessment tool was piloted in 15 operations, while an AGD policy monitoring tool, to record and track progress on the 10 core actions through indicators, was also developed and 19 field-tested in six operations.\n\nIn Chad, a UNHCR staff member begins the process of registering newly-arrived Sudanese refugees. participatory assessments reported across UNHCR operations operations in the\n\nAmericas, East Africa and the Middle East and North Africa benefited from\n\nUNHCR's AGD policy roll-out\n\nProgramming for\n\nProtection learning programmes implemented, benefiting 95 participants of multi-functional teams in\n\n70+ operations supporting refugee, IDP, returnee and stateless populations reported progress in the disaggregation of data by age, sex and diversity refugees participated in the Global Refugee Forum through panels and speakers' corner presentations\n\nParticipatory approaches remain a critical component of UNHCR's age, gender and diversity (AGD) and community-based protection approaches, which are some operations applying particularly creative participatory methods. For example, in Rwanda, interactive activities and games with children, including theatre, photography and painting workshops, led to increased engagement and feedback. In Lebanon, 129 refugees were mobilized as evaluators to help increase refugee engagement in the monitoring and evaluation of programmes. By the end of 2019, this practice was expanded to different sectors, such as water, sanitation and hygiene.\n\nTo account for the differing needs of people of concern, UNHCR collected, as contextually appropriate, data disaggregated by age, sex and diversity, for both analysis and programming purposes. In 2019, operations reported progress 28 disaggregating data by age, sex and diversity. Moreover, all three UNHCR-led or co-led clusters-protection, shelter and CCCM-ensured that data collected for needs analyses and response planning was disaggregated by age, gender and increasingly, disability.\n\nOver 70 refugees participated in the\n\nGlobal Refugee Forum through panels and speakers' corner presentations.\n\nThey advocated and provided insight and guidance on the unique needs of women, youth, children, persons with disability and others of diverse backgrounds. Their engagement was sought both in the preparations leading up to and at the Forum.\n\nIt is often difficult to collect disaggregated data reflective of the true diversity of a population, meaning not only age and gender, but also identifying who within it may need particular assistance because of a disability, belonging to a particular ethnic group, or because of sexual preference.\n\nWhere disaggregated data is not available, this may result in programmes that are inadequately responsive to all the community's needs.\n\nThough data is typically disaggregated by age, its collection by differing age groups represented a challenge to UNHCR in 2019. This resulted in certain populations and their needs, such as youth, going unidentified and, therefore, overlooked.\n\nDue to limited funding, emerging priorities and the need to reprioritize activities, the development of the updated AGD e-learning programme was postponed to 2020.\n\nUNHCR's Policy on Age, Gender and Diversity\n\nUNHCR POLICY\n\nON AGE, GENDER\n\nAND DIVERSITY implemented across its operations.

In Italy, the PartecipAzione programme expanded to 11 regions, targeting refugees (50% women) affiliated with 145 community-based organizations with 69 training to reinforce communication, fundraising, international protection, project management and administration activities. More than 6,000 people directly benefitted from these micro-projects.\n\nIn the Syrian Arab Republic, UNHCR provided protection responses through community centres and 33 satellite centres 98 in 12 governorates, as a result of which 619,051 vulnerabilities were recorded.\n\nUNHCR's capacity at country level to implement community-based protection was also supported through the community-based protection learning programme, which targeted 75 participants.\n\nIn addition, a community-based protection online training module was launched in November 2019.\n\nMembers of Women Standing, an association that helps widows and orphans, both Christian and Muslim, overcome trauma and rebuild their lives, celebrate Mother's Day in Begoua, near Bangui in the Central African Republic. operations reported a higher percentage of implemented programme priorities identified by community members people of concern represented in leadership management structures\n\n4,235 operations reported a greater percentage of host community members' expressions of support for the continued presence of people community groups supported by UNHCR operations across all regions, while 1,620 community self-management structures were strengthened in 45 operations\n\nEffective community-based protection requires time, resources and constant innovation to adapt to rapidly changing contexts. While the community-based protection learning programme allowed for this knowledge exchange, funding constraints limited the number of staff who could join the programme in 2019.\n\nSupport for community-based mechanisms was also challenged by funding limitations as well as context-specific realities, such as places where outreach and meaningful participation was hindered by insecurity and/or restrictions imposed by authorities.\n\nWhere such limitations prevailed, and indeed more broadly, UNHCR invested in innovative means of outreach and communication, including with those it has limited or no direct contact with.\n\nFor example, UNHCR operations in\n\nEgypt, Lebanon and Venezuela\n\n(Bolivarian Republic of) used WhatsApp to communicate key messages and receive information from communities. In Algeria,\n\nUNHCR started working on a feedback and complaint system using the KoBo toolbox as an additional means of seeking and collecting feedback in challenging environments from people of concern.\n\nEfforts in 2019 to ensure proximity and foster meaningful participation through community-based approaches included supporting community action plans, building leadership and project management skills, diversifying communication and outreach channels, and strengthening community self-management and self-protection structures.\n\nIn Bangladesh, for example, community outreach volunteers reached\n\n598,405 refugees with messaging on protection and emergency preparedness, and 554 religious leaders were engaged to positively influence the behavioural norms of their communities. In Jordan, community centres and community 26 support committees in the camps and urban areas served as protection hubs and provided a platform for structured dialogue between\n\n©UNHCR/Jean-Jacques Soha\n\nPeople of concern are powerful agents of their own protection and UNHCR is committed to ensuring their central participation in decisions that affect their lives. To strengthen this important work in its operations, UNHCR ensured dedicated community-based protection expertise and capacity was embedded in each of the seven newly-established regional bureaux.\n\nStrengthening neighborhood policing in Bele refugee settlement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n\nIn Haut Uele Province, which hosts high numbers of South Sudanese refugees, a joint pilot project is underway between UNHCR, UNDP and UNPOL.\n\nThe project is designed to reinforce local governance, rule of law, community-based protection and the local economy by building the capacity of local authorities to protect communities. It involves 150 people from the local administration, police, the army, civil jurisdictions, traditional chiefs and others in and around the new Bele refugee settlement, to which South Sudanese refugees are being relocated.\n\nUNDP contributes by putting in place neighborhood policing structures, such as local peace and development committees. Under UNDP's supervision, UNPOL reinforces the technical and operational capacities of the police with training to ensure the respect of six key principles- proximity, partnership, prevention, resolution of problems, accountability, and respect of human rights. Modules cover topics such as escorting refugees, ensuring security in refugee settlements, respect of human rights, prevention and response to sexual and gender-based violence, protection and more. UNHCR supports income-generating activities, with a focus on women and youth.\n\n\"Even the most experienced trainers saw this training as a plus.

In Liberia and\n\nZambia, efforts were made to ensure equal access to and control over assistance, for example by including women on distribution committees. Access to economic opportunities and education services was promoted in operations including in Burkina Faso, Jordan, Uganda and Yemen, where daycare in camps and community centres allowed mothers to continue their studies and engage in livelihood activities. Operations also worked with community structures to identify sexual and gender-based violence\n\n(SGBV) risks and support prevention and response mechanisms.\n\nUNHCR focused on increasing organizational gender equality capacity and strengthened its staff's ability to respond effectively to gender equality concerns across operational contexts.\n\nColleagues from operations across Africa participated in the third cohort of UNHCR's gender equality learning programme, enhancing their capacity to function as technical gender focal points and advocates within operations.\n\nTo enable cross-operational learning and inspire action to advance gender equality, promising practices were documented and shared. This includes promising practices on gender equality from the Asia and the\n\nPacific region, as well as a study on barriers to IDP women and girls' participation in humanitarian settings. The findings from the study were shared with staff and partners through a webinar, which was part of a series celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. Operations also received guidance on how to apply the Gender with\n\nAge Marker to the operational planning process to strengthen gender equality integration in UNHCR programmes.\n\nThe marker is also used to strengthen gender equality integration in projects included in Humanitarian Response Planning in inter-agency IDP responses.\n\nLearning from experience to advance gender equality: Promising practices in Asia\n\nDeeply rooted and restrictive gender norms, discriminatory practices and structural barriers frequently prevent refugee women, internally displaced women and other women of concern to UNHCR from realizing their rights and participating meaningfully in the decision-making and leadership structures impacting their lives and communities.\n\nUNHCR and partners must continuously strengthen and innovate when working with women and girls, their families and communities to maximize the change opportunities present in displacement contexts and to progressively and positively address entrenched and restrictive norms. This includes seeking out strategic partnerships around gender equality and partnering with local women's rights organizations.\n\nLEARNING FROM\n\nEXPERIENCE TO ADVANCE\n\nPromising practices in Asia\n\nTearing down the walls: Confronting the barriers to internally displaced women and girl's participation in humanitarian settings\n\nTEARING\n\nDOWN THE WALLS\n\n© UNHCR/Andrew McConnell\n\nCONFRONTING THE BARRIERS TO INTERNALLY DISPLACED\n\nWOMEN AND GIRLS' PARTICIPATION IN HUMANITARIAN\n\nSETTINGS\n\nGender audit of the Global Refugee Forum\n\nUNHCR promoted global-level participation and leadership of refugee women through support for a gender audit of the Global Refugee Forum and the processes leading up to it. Led by refugee women, the audit drew attention to gender equality-related challenges in refugee contexts. It sought to ensure the commitments made to refugee women and girls in the Global Compact on Refugees were acknowledged and integrated concretely through the Forum pledging process and by identifying good practices. Throughout the preparatory meetings, and at the Forum itself, the gender audit team documented the way gender equality, age, gender, diversity and SGBV were addressed by different stakeholders across key thematic areas. The team also provided specific recommendations on how to effectively implement and monitor pledges focusing on these areas.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 177\n\nCHILD PROTECTION, YOUTH ENGAGEMENT AND EMPOWERMENT\n\n© UNHCR/Antoine Tardy collaboration to respond to the needs of refugee and migrant children.\n\nDemonstrating its commitment to IDPs at country level, UNHCR built up case management capacity in Iraq and enhanced the child protection expertise of 174 staff from a local NGO working with IDP children, as well as staff from the Federal Ministry of\n\nLabour and Social Affairs and the Directorate of Social Affairs.

Progress was made regionally, too, with UNHCR supporting\n\nMember States of the East Africa\n\nCommunity and the Intergovernmental\n\nAuthority on Development to strengthen their inclusion of refugees in national child systems. It also promoted cross-border\n\nDespite UNHCR's work to scale up access to, and improve the quality of, best interests procedures and other child-friendly procedures, during the last three years the number of best interests assessments undertaken has decreased (from 65,561 in to 55,769 in 2019), while the number 2017 of unaccompanied and separated children in need has continued to increase. This has led to a widening gap between needs and access to services. Operations have cited a lack of both staffing and comprehensive, community-based programmes for children that allow for the effective identification and support of unaccompanied and separated children, and for other children at risk.\n\nUNHCR's investment in timely identification and referral of children at risk, alongside quality best interests assessments, has been essential to improving the quality of care for children at risk. For example,\n\nUNHCR worked in the Syrian Arab Republic with ILO and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour to offer specialized case management services in support of\n\nIDP children engaged in the worst 489 forms of child labour. Of these children,\n\n10% returned to school, 8% enrolled in vocational training and 47% joined remedial classes with the objective of returning to school in 2020.\n\nEmpowering and engaging youth, children and communities\n\nUNHCR improved the linkages between case management for refugee children and family strengthening initiatives, in line with guidance from the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children. In\n\nUganda, UNHCR reinforced alternative care monitoring for unaccompanied and separated children and positive parenting activities. UNHCR and partners trained\n\n1,148 stakeholders to identify children at risk and implemented the Best Interests\n\nProcedure for individual children in need of targeted support. Together, they also conducted positive parenting training for 15,027 parents and caregivers, and awareness sessions on ending violence against children for 10,921 community members and 2,566 adolescents.\n\nUNHCR supported a range of initiatives to strengthen youth leadership and action, including through youth-led projects, the Global Youth Advisory Council, and capacity building for youth. In 2019,\n\nUNHCR funded 18 youth-led projects in 16 countries under the Youth Initiative Fund. Some 900 refugees, host community and IDP youths identified creative solutions to address the protection problems they faced, including sexual and gender-based violence, child protection, integration with host communities, and the lack of education and livelihood opportunities.\n\nCoordination, knowledge, and information management\n\nUNHCR strengthened information management capacity for child protection to maximize resources, ensuring smarter, more effective and evidence-based programming.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 179\n\nIn promoting inclusion in national child protection systems, challenges remained due to the complexity of the issues and involvement by stakeholders. Legal, policy or procedural barriers often prevented access to child protection systems and services. Where national child protection systems were accessible to refugees and other children of concern, key service providers often lacked the knowledge and capacity to effectively coordinate and respond to the complex protection needs of these children.\n\nPROTECTING PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES\n\nAND OLDER PERSONS\n\nFor UNHCR and its governmental and NGO partners, a commonly cited challenge in providing quality case management for children at risk was insufficient staffing.\n\nFurther challenges included sudden increases in the numbers of unaccompanied and separated children and their onward movement in crises; little support for foster families; lack of access to unaccompanied and separated children in detention; limited capacity on best interests procedures; limited availability of durable solutions and specialized services; and weak national systems.\n\n© UNHCR/Jim Huylebroek\n\nSuch investments resulted in 30 UNHCR operations using the child protection module in proGres v4, UNHCR's case management software, up from 16 at the end of 2018.\n\nAt the end of 2019, 8,047 child protection cases were entered in proGres v4, a 150% increase compared to 2018.\n\nThere is a strong foundation of innovative approaches to youth programming across UNHCR. However, no streamlined way exists to capture youth-disaggregated data across humanitarian agencies. This continued lack of a common means to systematically track progress and ensure accountability for the implementation of the Core Actions for Youth is hampering further progress.\n\nRefugees returning to Afghanistan from Pakistan rebuild despite challenges.\n\nFrom May 2019 to February 2020, UNHCR teamed up with the Scort Foundation and the FCSA-the Football Club Social Alliance, a network of European football clubs from Austria, Germany and\n\nSwitzerland-to implement the Young Coach Education Programme in Mexico.\n\nThis programme, which in the past few years has been rolled out in conflict-affected, post-war or developing regions around the world, uses football to create positive social change within host communities like in Mexico by empowering young people to become role models and mentors for children.\n\nDrawn from 15 of UNHCR's local partners in Mexico, 41 young adults were educated to become so-called Young Coaches-community leaders and grassroots football coaches for children aged 6-12. They learned how to promote the inclusion of refugees and asylum-seekers through football, how to pass on important values such as acceptance, openness and tolerance, and thus how to ease tensions between refugee and host populations.\n\nDuring the modules, UNHCR and partners provided the Young Coaches with knowledge on relevant social topics such as child protection and sexual and gender-based violence, which now helps them in their work with youth. To date, the Young Coaches have passed on their knowledge to 321 peers, and over 7,700 children from both host and refugee populations have benefitted from these regular activities.\n\n© Scort Foundation\n\nFootball providing role models and mentors for children operations reported progress in the percentage of older persons of concern who received services for their needs\n\nPersons with disabilities make up an estimated 15% of the global population, although disability prevalence in situations of forced displacement, particularly among refugees and other displaced populations, is estimated to be considerably higher.\n\nThe year saw the launch of two new resources to enhance UNHCR's capacity to better protect and respond to the needs of persons with disabilities in situations of percentage of people of concern with disabilities who receive services for their needs forced displacement.

To better identify persons with disabilities in Algeria, Lebanon and\n\nMauritania, UNHCR operations started using the Washington Group Questions, a standardized set of questions designed to identify people with disabilities during registration activities. In Jordan, these questions were included in the vulnerability assessment framework. Data from this assessment ultimately revealed that up to\n\n21% of Syrian refugees were living with a disability and 45% of households had at least one individual with a disability.\n\nAt the regional and country levels, collaboration was strengthened with national and international disability and ageing partners, including organizations of persons with disabilities, the International\n\nDisability Alliance, Humanity and Inclusion and HelpAge International. For example, in Lebanon, UNHCR collaborated with the Lebanese Physically Handicapped Union to improve support for those with disabilities during a humanitarian response. As a result, the Union signed cooperation protocols with 97 companies, which began adding inclusion standards to their employment policies, as well as ensuring full accessibility to their buildings. In Yemen, 156 children with disabilities had access to rehabilitation and education services in UNHCR-run early learning centres for children with disabilities, preparing them to enroll and learn in formal schools. In Libya, UNHCR collaborated with Humanity and Inclusion and four organizations of persons with disabilities to offer support to refugees and advocate their inclusion in social activities and vocational training, as well as their access to prosthetic devices and information and awareness raising. Over 860 persons with disabilities accessed rehabilitation\n\nAs a result of UNHCR's consultations with organizations of persons with disabilities to prepare for the Global Refugee Forum, pledges supporting UNHCR's work on 14 disability inclusion were made at the Forum. Commitments, most of which were global in scope and coverage, included developing policies and programmes that are disability inclusive; strengthening disability-inclusive practices in education and livelihood projects; supporting the institutionalization of disability inclusion in all UNHCR's activities through greater technical capacity; and facilitating the integration of refugees with disabilities.\n\nThey also pledged to strengthen the capacity of organizations of persons with disabilities for meaningful participation and leadership, which is expected to generate an institutional agreement for collaboration between the International Disability Alliance and UNHCR in 2020.\n\nRecognizing the need to prioritize work on disability inclusion, UNHCR invested in additional staffresources to ensure both institutional mainstreaming and disability inclusion at the country level.\n\nAs displaced populations are often located in areas of conflict with limited government infrastructure, persons with disabilities remain under identified and do not fully\n\n© Courtesy of Bawk Ra\n\nTo further advance the Convention on the\n\nRights of Persons with Disabilities, UNHCR actively contributed to developing the\n\nUN Disability Inclusion Strategy and the\n\nIASC guidelines on inclusion of persons with disabilities in humanitarian action. access assistance or services. UNHCR's methodology used to collect data on disability still relies heavily on observation\n\n(82% of all data disaggregated by disability), which is not in line with international recommendations. As such, the most pressing constraints identified in relation to the objectives laid out in the Global Compact on Refugees include: the development of harmonized or interoperable standards for the collection, analysis, and sharing of age, gender, disability and diversity disaggregated data on refugees and returnees; dedicated human and financial resources; and expertise to strengthen accessibility and the provision of reasonable accommodation in all refugee responses.\n\nInternally displaced persons with disabilities share their stories\n\nSince 2017, UNHCR has partnered with professional photographers to provide a 12-day masterclass on photo storytelling in Myanmar for internally displaced people with disabilities and their caregivers. The project empowers displaced persons with disabilities by giving them the skills, confidence and opportunity to tell their story and advocate for their needs. It also enables caregivers and frontline humanitarian workers to raise awareness on disability and the challenges associated with disability.\n\nIn February 2019, Bawk Ra, a young woman who acquired a physical disability when she was five, was selected to compete in the Yangon Photo Festival and won third prize in the emerging photographers category. She subsequently shared her skills in photo-training workshops for other displaced persons living with a disability in IDP camps in Kachin State.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 183\n\nPROTECTING LGBTI PERSONS IN FORCED DISPLACEMENT\n\nUNHCR/Diego Ibarra Sánchez Two Syrian refugees who risked their lives for the sake of love, await resettlement. regional consultations organized to better assess protection risks and priorities of LGBTI persons in forced\n\nPartnerships with global, regional and national\n\nLGBTI stakeholders established or strengthened through regional consultations\n\nUNHCR has made steady progress in the last several years to better protect persons of diverse sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics.\n\nThese efforts have included issuing guidance and tools, and developing training that help create safe spaces and identify solutions for LGBTI persons of concern.\n\nDespite this progress, in most operations, many LGBTI refugees, IDPs, stateless persons and returnees continued to experience discrimination and abuse.\n\nTo counter this, UNHCR operations around the world invested in better understanding\n\nUNHCR and partner staff in East Africa benefited from the LGBTI learning programme \"Working with LGBTI persons in forced displacement\" of the needs and protection risks faced by\n\nLGBTI persons in forced displacement to ensure a rights-based and results-oriented response. This included creating a welcoming environment in UNHCR and partner offices, engaging with LGBTI displaced communities and their organizations, ensuring communication and feedback channels are accessible to them, and that services are available and accessible for those in need.\n\nIn Jordan, for example, UNHCR ensured its offices were safe for LGBTI persons and that staff were trained to identify and address their concerns. Specific measures included a network of LGBTI-sensitized staff and fast-track, confidential and specialized standard operating procedures. Similarly, in Uganda, UNHCR established and trained gender and LGBTI focal points in all settlements, while in the Venezuela situation, questions on LGBTI protection risks were included in the protection monitoring tool used in all countries involved in the response. country level. The official UNHCR learning programme on working with LGBTI persons in forced displacement was organized with a primary focus on East Africa. In addition to the global and regional training initiatives, operations also organized country-level training sessions that were contextualized and adapted to national needs, such as in\n\nBelgium, Israel, Kenya, Mozambique, Tajikistan and Uganda.\n\nOther operations recruited LGBTI refugees as outreach workers with the aim of conducting targeted and low-profile information sessions that meet the information needs of LGBTI refugees.\n\nIn Thailand, in collaboration with an operational partner, a peer support group for LGBTI persons of concern was established to combat the overwhelming feelings of isolation often experienced by individuals in this population. In Ecuador,\n\nUNHCR reviewed its partner's interview and registration process to ensure sensitivity towards LGBTI persons and partnered with\n\nLGBTI organizations to establish safe spaces.\n\nUNHCR continued to invest significantly in training and capacity-building of staff, partners, asylum officers and service providers, both at Headquarters and\n\nIn many parts of the world, LGBTI persons of concern face virulent and often violent discrimination. Despite all efforts, they remain a largely under-identified population and, as such, targeted programmes and interventions remain limited. Building the capacity to the required scale of UNHCR staff, partners, service providers and asylum adjudicators in this area will require significant further investment.\n\nWhile identified LGBTI refugees most at risk are prioritized for RSD and resettlement, the reality of shrinking resettlement opportunities dictates that more effort must be dedicated to identifying alternatives, including complementary pathways and carefully-crafted integration strategies, where possible.\n\nLGBTI regional consultations across the globe\n\nBeginning in May 2019, UNHCR embarked on regional consultations in the Americas, Asia and the\n\nPacific, the Middle East and North Africa, and East and West Africa to gain a contemporary understanding of the protection risks, perspectives and priorities of LGBTI persons in forced displacement. A wide range of actors in the LGBTI space were consulted, including civil society advocates and those displaced with an LGBTI profile. In addition to fostering the creation of new networks and avenues of collaboration, findings from these consultations will be the basis of a global round table in 2020, aimed at identifying concrete actions that will advance protection and solutions for LGBTI displaced and stateless persons.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 185\n\nT H E M AT I C C H A P T E R S I R E S P O N D I N G W I T H L I F E S AV I N G S U P P O R T\n\nT H E M AT I C C H A P T E R S I R E S P O N D I N G W I T H L I F E S AV I N G S U P P O R T\n\nResponding with lifesaving\n\nDuring 2019, UNHCR and its partners responded to the needs of 16.7 million displaced people affected by multiple and simultaneous emergencies worldwide. By mobilizing financial, human and material resources, and facilitating partnership engagement, UNHCR responded to refugee and IDP emergencies, providing protection and assistance despite challenging security environments.\n\nGiven the scale of needs, UNHCR activated six new emergencies involving eight countries, including four L3 and four L2 emergencies.\n\nThese included three refugee emergencies, and three IDP emergencies-one of which was the response to the natural disaster and displacement caused by Cyclone Idai- during which UNHCR boosted its preparedness and response capacities.\n\nThe Office also continued responding to emergencies activated in the previous year. However, the pace of emergency deployments did slow, as emergency declarations in 31 countries were deactivated throughout the year.\n\nIn 2019, 22 operations reported a high risk of new or escalated refugee or IDP situations in the High Alert List for Emergency\n\nPreparedness (HALEP), UNHCR's internal global repository of preparedness information.\n\nUNHCR completed the Preparedness\n\nPackage for IDP emergencies (PPIE), which is aligned with the Preparedness Package for Refugee Emergencies (PRRE) and the\n\nIASC's Emergency Response Preparedness Approach.

The strategic and analytical capacities of the bureaux were reinforced. New thresholds governing procurement and asset management were introduced, and the seven regions increased their supply management capacity. In addition, work began on a new emergency stockpile in Panama City to serve emergencies in the Americas, bringing UNHCR's global emergency stockpiles to eight.\n\nThis chapter outlines UNHCR's emergency response in 2019 and its coordination of principled, comprehensive and prompt high-quality lifesaving interventions.\n\nIt highlights the progress made, and challenges faced, in meeting the most urgent humanitarian and protection needs of refugees and IDPs, as well as those of the communities hosting them.\n\nThe Preparedness\n\nPackage for\n\nTHE PREPAREDNESS\n\nPACKAGE FOR REFUGEE\n\nEMERGENCIES (PPRE)\n\n• Emergency preparedness and response\n\n• Global supply management\n\n• Prevention and response to sexual and gender-based violence\n\n• Cash assistance\n\n• Public health\n\n• Nutrition and food security\n\n• Water, sanitation and hygiene\n\n• Shelter and settlements\n\nA reference guide for preparedness\n\nVersion 2 - 2018\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 187\n\nUNHCR activated six new emergencies affecting eight countries in 2019\n\nLevel 3\n\nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE of the Congo\n\nIDP emergencies\n\nUNHCR emergency staffdeployed\n\n© UNHCR/Alissa Everett\n\nRefugee emergencies\n\nEmergency standby partners deployed\n\nGlobal stockpiles were used to deliver CRIs\n\nTents\n\n1,094\n\nUNHCR staff & partners trained in emergency preparedness and response\n\nEmergency airlifts, fulfilling\n\nSolar lamps\n\nEight tons of humanitarian aid arrives at Beira, Mozambique, for distribution to survivors of Cyclone Idai.\n\nRequests\n\nPlastic sheets\n\n10,480\n\n114,505\n\n452,390\n\nKitchen sets\n\nThermal blankets\n\nBuckets\n\n250,935\n\n1,052,905\n\n261,813\n\nJerry cans\n\nSleeping mats\n\nMosquito nets\n\n305,376\n\n751,269\n\n431,345\n\nPreparing for an emergency requires risk monitoring and preparation, including scenario-based contingency planning.\n\nIn 2019, UNHCR activated six new emergencies involving eight countries, including four L3s (the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe) and four L2s (Burkina Faso, Costa Rica, Iraq and Niger). These activated countries included five IDP emergencies (Burkina Faso, the DRC,\n\nMalawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe) and three refugee emergencies (Costa Rica, Iraq and Niger).\n\nAs some emergencies stabilized in places like Bangladesh and Uganda, and with the deactivation of emergencies in 31 countries, the pace of emergency deployments slowed in 2019. UNHCR facilitated deployments compared to 420 in 269\n\n2018, including 167 UNHCR internal staff, and 102 external staffworking for emergency standby partners.\n\nMost staffdeployed (161 or 60%) lent vital support to UNHCR's refugee responses, while most of the others (103 or 38%) joined efforts to help IDP responses, with 2% in roving roles. In addition, UNHCR's\n\nEmergency Management Team spent\n\n1,779 days on emergency missions and days providing functional support to 747\n\nUNHCR operations.

The tool reflects UNHCR's aim to engage more consistently, predictably and sustainably in situations of internal displacement, in both its coordination and operational roles.\n\nThere were 22 operations which reported a high risk of new or escalating refugee or IDP situations in the HALEP, with 81% prepared for the risk. New contingency plans were prepared for 23 country operations. There were 345 UNHCR and partner staff trained on emergency management and who participated in inter-agency emergency exercises and workshops.\n\nField security\n\nUNHCR's security workforce, made up of 88 international and more than national security professionals, 250 ensured security and safety were integrated as normal functions of the Office's operations and activity. In addition to responding to 311 security incidents,\n\nUNHCR's security workforce also supported managers and staff on 12 critical incidents in 2019, coordinating with the\n\nUN Department of Safety and Security in New York and government personnel.\n\nWorking with standby partners on emergency preparedness and response Partnership is critical for effective emergency preparedness and response. In 2019, UNHCR maintained 17 active emergency response partnerships:\n\n•\n\nIrishAid\n\nInternational Humanitarian Partnership\n\nSave the Children Norway\n\nSwedish Civil Contingencies Agency\n\nSwiss Agency for Development and\n\nCooperation\n\n• Veolia Environment Foundation\n\n• White Helmets Commission\n\nIn the course of 2019, three new emergency response partnerships were established:\n\n• Danish Emergency Management Agency\n\n• Turkey's Disaster and Emergency\n\nManagement Authority\n\n• Russian Federation's Ministry for Civil\n\nDefense, Emergencies and Elimination of Consequences of Natural Disasters\n\nMaintaining a robust training programme remained key to field security work.\n\nIn 2019, 749 UNHCR and partner staff were trained on security-related topics, including\n\n© UNHCR/Filip Pongrac\n\nBundesanstalt Technisches Hiflswerk\n\nCANADEM\n\nDepartment for International Development,\n\nDirectorate for Civil Protection and\n\nEmergency Planning of Norway\n\nDutch Surge Support Water Emergency.lu, Luxemburg Ministry of\n\nForeign Affairs the Security Management Learning\n\nProgramme and Women's Security Awareness Training. UNHCR also adapted service delivery to the new, decentralized organizational model, focusing on effective field support through the new empowered regional bureaux. In addition, UNHCR was represented in key forums, such as the Inter-Agency Security Management\n\nNetwork, and it participated in developing\n\nIASC and UN guidance on civil-military coordination.\n\nPreparedness\n\nPackage for IDP\n\nKey gaps identified in emergency preparedness included staffing capacity, stalled discussions with host governments regarding their willingness and approach to receive refugees, and technical expertise in areas such as site planning, supply and cash preparedness.\n\nThe diverse locations of the emergencies requiring UNHCR deployments meant multiple languages (French, Spanish and\n\nEnglish) and profiles were needed, despite limited resources. This required more staff time and effort, both from UNHCR and its partners.\n\nUPS Foundation transports critical supplies to refugees\n\nIn 2019, the UPS Foundation supported\n\nUNHCR through emergency funding to provide core relief items to affected populations in the DRC, and through in-kind air charter flights to Malawi,\n\nNiger and Somalia to deliver lifesaving supplies such as blankets, emergency shelter and sleeping mats.\n\nSince 2010, the UPS Foundation has been a leading\n\nUNHCR corporate partner, contributing funds, services and expertise in transportation, supply chain logistics and communications to support refugees and displaced people across the globe.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 191\n\nGLOBAL SUPPLY MANAGEMENT\n\n© UNHCR/Hossein Fatemi\n\nUNHCR dispatches aid and shelter supplies to Bardarash camp in Duhok, Iraq, for Syrian refugees fleeing the north-east of the Syrian Arab Republic.\n\nUNHCR provided timely, cost-effective support when responding to new and ongoing emergencies, dispatching\n\n$30 million-worth of emergency core relief items from seven global stockpiles to 23 emergency-affected countries.\n\nThe top five recipients of this assistance were the DRC and Yemen (900 tons each), and Ethiopia, Nigeria and South Sudan (500 tons each). Global stockpiles were used during eight emergency airlifts, fulfilling 122 requests. In addition to the seven global stockpiles in Accra, Amman,\n\nCopenhagen, Douala, Dubai, Nairobi and Kampala, work began on an eighth stockpile in Panama City.\n\nUNHCR's supply chain provided reliable and efficient service delivery to new and ongoing emergencies and field operations throughout 2019. By merging the procurement, supply and logistics teams,\n\nUNHCR developed a responsive, agile service that allowed more efficient decision making. This was important given\n\nUNHCR's newly-decentralized structures, and in a year when procurement requests increased from $1.1 billion to $1.14 billion, including $803 million in the field and $337 million in Headquarters. UNHCR also provided contract administration services for 296 global frame agreements with international suppliers for a wide range of relief items, supplies and\n\nIn 2019 UNHCR managed 5,150 vehicles under the centralized global fleet system-a 23% increase compared with 4,165 vehicles in 2018.\n\nTo boost its supply and delivery capacity, the Office collaborated with partners and sister UN agencies and remained an active member of the High-Level Committee on\n\nManagement, the UN's Procurement\n\nNetwork and the Common Procurement Activities Group. Collaborative procurement activities also continued via the United\n\nNations Global Marketplace and other stakeholders. Inter-agency partnerships also grew as UNHCR made greater use of the opportunity to piggyback on the common procurement of UN country teams. The Office also participated in the\n\nUN Global Sustainable Transport Working\n\nGroup and took the first steps towards greening UNHCR's supply chain through the United States Agency for International\n\nDevelopment-led, multi-institutional effort to reduce packaging waste in aid delivery.\n\nThe UN Secretary-General remained committed to reforming the business practices of the United Nations. The\n\nBusiness Innovation Group (BIG), which is one of the United Nations Sustainable\n\nDevelopment Goals' Results Groups, has been tasked with achieving greater effectiveness and efficiency by harmonizing back office functions, expanding common premises and mutually recognizing policies across different UN agencies and organizations. In 2019, UNHCR prioritized\n\nBIG participation, supporting 29 common office projects to reach the BIG target on common premises and facility services.\n\nUNHCR organized inter-agency auctions to responsibly dispose of light vehicles.\n\nSeven sister UN agencies participated, as did three other humanitarian organizations.\n\nAs part of its offer for fleet management services, UNHCR also developed a pilot carpool project in Lebanon, in coordination with other UN agencies. The service developed a project to optimize fleet size and cost performance through a carpooling business model that may also be of interest within the BIG concept.\n\nEnhancing the supply chain, UNHCR introduced several automated processes, and Power BI-based key performance indicator reports revolutionized its big data analyses. For more efficient supply chain planning and forecasting,\n\nUNHCR successfully rolled out Demantra\n\n(a demand management and supply chain management tool) to more than additional operations covering more 20 than 90% of the inventory value for further distribution in 2019. The service provided supply chain-related, back office support with updated user guidelines, resolving more than 3,000 incidents.\n\nBeyond guaranteeing efficient delivery,\n\nUNHCR helped deploy skilled workers to emergencies and conducted 451 functional clearances for supply positions worldwide, to ensure a broader range of more qualified and diverse UNHCR supply staff.\n\nThroughout the year, supply structures needed continuous strengthening in terms of numbers of staff, their grade and access to up-to-date training and learning opportunities, so staff could effectively deal with ongoing and emerging crises.\n\nNew emergencies in the Americas and other places lacking established global stocks presented a challenge in terms of effective coverage. UNHCR coordinated through the new regional bureaux to explore how new stocks and fleet hubs could be established.\n\nRoad safety remained an area of concern.\n\nUNHCR worked to reduce the incident rate, both directly and through the Inter-Agency\n\nSteering Committee implementing the UN Road Safety Strategy.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 193\n\nPREVENTION AND RESPONSE TO SEXUAL\n\nAND GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE\n\n© UNHCR/John Wessel An internally displaced Congolese woman talks to UNHCR in Tshikapa, in the DRC. \"While fleeing, I travelled for four days and nights. The militia killed two people in my group, and me and the other women were raped by one man after another.\"\n\nIn 2019, UNHCR expanded its SGBV prevention, risk mitigation and response work, including at the outset of emergencies. This was largely thanks to the Safe from the Start initiative, a joint\n\nUnited States of America-UNHCR partnership launched in 2014 that was designed to prevent and respond to SGBV among people of concern, promote multisectoral risk mitigation strategies, and ensure SGBV prevention and response programmes were mainstreamed at the onset of an emergency as a lifesaving intervention.\n\nUnder Safe from the Start, UNHCR deployed senior SGBV staff to Brazil,\n\nCameroon, Chad, Djibouti, Ethiopia,\n\nNigeria, Mozambique, Sudan, Uganda,\n\nYemen and Zambia, six of which-Cameroon,\n\nEthiopia, Nigeria, Sudan, Uganda and Yemen-had large IDP populations.\n\nAn evaluative review, using UNHCR data, found these experts helped more than double the coverage (25% to 59%) and efficiency (35% to 82%) of SGBV\n\n45,557\n\n3,308\n\n6,745 reported SGBV incidents psychosocial counselling for which survivors received legal assistance received medical assistance compared to 47,857 in 2018 compared to 4,699 in 2018 compared to 9,613 in 2018 displacement situations in which UNHCR sought to improve community involvement in the prevention of\n\nSGBV and the protection of survivors in which known SGBV survivors received appropriate support compared to 44 in 2018 compared to 35 in 2018\n\nSexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), predominantly perpetrated against women and girls, remained a serious human rights violation and public health problem.\n\nIt affects all people of concern to UNHCR in all locations and situations.\n\nTo ensure quality case management systems, referral pathways and SGBV services were in place, UNHCR worked with national and local partners. In Lebanon, for instance, national standards for case management were raised when 438 case workers, supervisors and government staff completed a peer-to-peer coaching programme. In 2019, 2,885 UNHCR staff also completed an SGBV e-learning course.\n\nEmergency deployments to refugee and IDP operations meant 1.2 million additional people of concern had benefited from expanded SGBV-relevant medical referral systems since 2014.\n\nUNHCR worked to prevent SGBV and encourage refugee and IDP women's participation in decision-making processes, focusing on combatting unequal gender norms that legitimize violence against women and girls. For example, in Nigeria, UNHCR and partners reached around 45,000 IDPs through the Zero Tolerance Village Alliance model, which propelled community action against SGBV through community groups, peer-to-peer support and campaigns.\n\nThey implemented SASA!, a community-led\n\nSGBV prevention programme addressing root causes by engaging men and boys, as well as religious, community and traditional leaders in Bangladesh, Ethiopia,\n\nIraq, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Malaysia,\n\nPakistan, Rwanda, Sri Lanka, Turkey,\n\nUganda, the United Republic of Tanzania and Yemen. Assessments found a positive effect on attitudes towards power dynamics in relationships and gender norms.\n\nUNHCR improved community involvement in SGBV prevention and protection of survivors in 24 refugee situations, as well as seven involving IDPs and three involving returnees. Working with communities, the Office implemented prevention programmes and awareness-raising initiatives addressing the root causes of gender-based violence, which brought changes in behavior and social norms.\n\nFurthermore, UNHCR supported SGBV survivors in 50 situations, involving refugees (43), IDPs (six) and returnees (one). More than 55,600 SGBV survivors had better access to medical, psychological, social and legal services, and the Office promoted inclusive services for all survivors, including women, girls, men, boys and other at-risk groups.\n\nGuidelines for\n\nIntegrating\n\nGender-Based\n\nViolence\n\nInterventions in\n\nAction\n\nUNHCR's multi-sectoral approaches to\n\nSGBV risk mitigation were strengthened in\n\nAsia and the Pacific, the Middle East and\n\nNorth Africa, and East Africa by implementing the IASC Guidelines for integrating\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 195\n\nPhoto by : Peter Biro/IRC\n\nWHERE IS\n\nTHE MONEY?\n\nHOW THE HUMANITARIAN\n\nSYSTEM IS FAILING IN ITS\n\nCOMMITMENTS TO END\n\nVIOLENCE AGAINST\n\nWOMEN AND GIRLS gender-based violence interventions in humanitarian action, which outline responsibilities for addressing SGBV and the practical steps humanitarian sectors should take to reduce risk in their relevant area. By the close of 2019, 414 UNHCR staff in 12 national and four regional cohorts had boosted their knowledge of risk mitigation by completing UNHCR's learning programmes. The Office also produced national action plans on SGBV risk mitigation. In Bangladesh, for example,\n\nUNHCR installed 2,500 streetlights, distributed 86,706 shelter locks, and issued 107,000 refugee households and\n\n10,700 host community families with liquid petroleum gas canisters, thereby reducing the risks associated with firewood collection, a task that often falls to women and girls.\n\nA UNHCR policy on the prevention, risk mitigation and response to gender-based violence (GBV), developed in 2019 and due for release in 2020, draws extensively on\n\nUNHCR's GBV work and will institutionalize and consolidate progress made by UNHCR and its partners.\n\nA recent study by the IRC and Voice found that SGBV funding accounted for just 0.12% of all humanitarian funding, representing one third of what was requested. Available funding did not meet needs or reach necessary targets or protection outcomes.\n\nThe study found lifesaving services, such as clinical care for SGBV survivors and female-only safe spaces, continued to be significantly underfunded and deprioritized in humanitarian responses. This means the needs of millions of women and girls caught in crisis are not being met.\n\nEarly and effective SGBV programming saves lives and money. Having dedicated staff with SGBV expertise, particularly from the onset of emergencies, improves survivors' access to services and reduces SGBV risks. However, resource constraints meant that dedicated staff remain limited across UNHCR, which in turn restricted the systematic prioritization of lifesaving SGBV services and programming.\n\nVirginie Laure, a woman in Cameroon, was attacked and raped by a group of strangers. Now seeking asylum in Greece, she is raising her voice to help others.\n\nThe Greek charity Diotima works with UNHCR to help survivors like Virginie learn about their rights and access medical and legal services. But with victims often reluctant to come forward, the biggest hurdle to that work can be identifying them in the first place.\n\n\"There is a huge stigma around sexual violence generally, but especially about rape. But survivors are now coming forward. Somehow, they overcome it.\"\n\n-Adamantia Lambouka, a psychologist working with Diotima.\n\nAziza Ibish, a Syrian asylum-seeker living in Greece, shops in the municipal market.

In line with its Grand Bargain commitment to double the use of cash as a proportion of its assistance by 2020, UNHCR has delivered some $2.4 billion in cash assistance since 2016 in more than countries. Cash assistance now 100 exceeds in-kind assistance. In 2019, some $650 million was distributed-a\n\n13% increase on 2018 expenditure and a 50% increase since 2015 ($325 million).\n\nUNHCR used cash for a range of purposes, including protection, basic needs, education, shelter, health, livelihoods and winterization.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 197\n\nCommon Cash\n\nStatement\n\n© UNHCR/David Azia\n\nCashAssist\n\nUNHCR's Cash Assistance\n\nManagement Systems\n\nUNHCR's Refugee\n\nLivelihoods and Economic\n\nInclusion:\n\n2019-2023 Global strategy\n\nRefugee Livelihoods and Economic Inclusion\n\n2019-2023 Global Strategy Concept Note\n\nEngage in advocacy to enhance the enabling environment such that refugees have legal and de facto access to decent work (such as through rights to work, own a business, access financial services, land/property ownership, and freedom of mobility).\n\nPartner with and convene expert entities to facilitate inclusion of refugees into existing programmes/services.\n\n© UNHCR/Christian Als\n\n● Conduct consultations with different types of stakeholders, such as: o Financial and Business Development Service\n\nProviders o Private Sector (companies, chambers of commerce, employment agencies, business associations) o Training Institutes (public and private) o Development Actors o NGOs o Governments o UN Agencies o Academia and Research Institutions\n\n● Complete an institutional mapping exercise to see if inclusion is viable, considering: o Whether actors have relevant services for refugees; o Capacity, incentives and influence of actors to include all targeted refugees; and o Expertise of entities and quality of market-based\n\nAs a last choice, implement interventions to fill a gap in service only when:\n\n● There is limited or no presence of expert entities who can include refugees; or\n\n● The engagement of other stakeholders is not possible or still insufficient to meet the needs of refugees.\n\nIn cases of implementation, operations are recommended to apply the Minimum\n\nEconomic Recovery Standards, which were initially a great contributor to the development of the Minimum Criteria for Livelihoods Programming.\n\nMost of the cash (95%) was multi-purpose, meaning it was disbursed without restriction. This allowed refugees and others of concern to choose how to meet their own needs. Evaluations demonstrated that cash prevented displaced people from resorting to negative coping strategies, such as child labour, selling or exchanging sex, early marriage or premature return to conflict zones. It also enhanced gender equality and women's empowerment. UNHCR research in Ecuador, Lebanon and\n\nMorocco indicated that access to cash could render women and girls less vulnerable to sexual exploitation, too.\n\nIn Lebanon, female cash recipients reported feeling stronger, more equal and more independent, thanks to the control cash gave them to meet their most pressing needs.\n\nCash assistance required a shift in mind set by UNHCR. Staffat all levels needed access to e-learning and face-to-face training, as well as guidance, implementation modalities and lessons learned. Since 2016, UNHCR has trained some 5,000 of its own and partners' staff on cash assistance. More than\n\n1,000 people were trained in 2019 alone, with a network of 100 cash experts established across UNHCR's operations.\n\nPursuing collaborative cash delivery mechanisms to ensure efficiencies in aid remained a cornerstone of UNHCR's cash institutionalization strategy. A common cash facility clause was implemented in countries and the High Commissioner 45 endorsed the Common Cash Statement- reaffirming UNHCR's commitment to provide cash through a common cash system used in crises globally to avoid parallel systems among operational agencies or duplicate financial instruments, based on the identification of \"shared business needs\" across agencies. UNHCR implemented the Common Cash\n\nStatement in seven priority countries and through global systems and guidance development, along with OCHA, UNICEF and WFP. The system is to be collectively owned, jointly governed, have clear and predictable roles, responsibilities and arrangements, and be available to multiple partners (including those outside the United Nations). Implementation built on existing good practices, such as\n\nLOUISE in Lebanon, the Common Cash\n\nFacility in Jordan and the Greece Cash Alliance. Among other achievements,\n\nUNHCR, UNICEF and WFP launched the\n\nGuidance for Collaborative Procurement for Humanitarian Cash Transfers and developed a minimum core data set for vulnerable populations.\n\nTo ensure accountability to populations affected by displacement, UNHCR developed CashAssist, a cash management system that ensured cash transfers were made to refugees, IDPs and others of concern in a timely, efficient and accurate manner while avoiding duplication and minimizing fraud. By the end of 2019, CashAssist had been rolled out in 10 operations, with the roll out to another 50 planned in the coming two years.\n\nUNHCR quadrupled its use of cash assistance for livelihoods programming too, increasing from 18 to 54 countries.\n\nCash was an integral element of UNHCR's forthcoming \"Refugee livelihoods and economic inclusion: 2019-2023\n\nGlobal strategy\".\n\nThe Office increasingly leveraged its cash assistance to promote financial inclusion and facilitated refugees' access to formal bank and mobile money accounts in countries such as Cameroon, the DRC,\n\nEthiopia, Iraq, Niger, Jordan, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and Zambia.\n\nWhile cash was an efficient form of aid that gave beneficiaries the power to prioritize their own spending, UNHCR analysis in nine countries revealed just 4% of interviewees could meet their basic needs with the cash assistance they received. Nearly half (47%) said the assistance met just half of their basic needs. As a result, many engaged in negative coping mechanisms, such as pulling children out of school, begging, onward movement or child labour. While it remained an efficient way to provide assistance, there was not enough cash available for it to meet people's basic needs in a long-term and sustainable way.\n\nMost of UNHCR's cash assistance (80%) was electronically disbursed, meaning vulnerable populations could access funds via their mobile phone or bank accounts.\n\nIn addition, in line with the objectives of the Global Compact on Refugees and building on the World Bank's IDA18 regional sub-window for refugees and host communities initiative, UNHCR leveraged its cash assistance to align with national social protection systems. Most recently, for instance, the Governments of Cameroon and\n\nChad allowed refugees to access their national social safety nets.\n\nTargeted assistance was crucial to ensuring the most vulnerable families were reached.\n\nUNHCR is therefore working with partners on common targeting approaches and developed joint guidance with WFP.\n\nCASH ASSISTANCE BY SECTOR | 2015 -2019\n\nCASH ASSISTANCE | 2015 -2019\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 199\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH\n\nManirakiza, a 25-year-old refugee from Burundi, and her baby, Irakoze, at Kalobeyei health clinic in north-west Kenya.\n\n0.12\n\n93.5% under-5 mortality rate crude mortality rate of births were attended compared to 0.3 in 2018 compared to 0.13 in 2018 compared to 94.4% in 2018\n\nUNHCR remained committed to refugees,\n\nIDPs and host communities accessing health services. In 2019, it supported access to primary health care, including sexual and reproductive health and nutrition services in 46 countries. It delivered HIV prevention and treatment, as well as reproductive health programmes within a framework of public health, protection and community development. systems. In 2019, it supported countries in making that happen. For instance, the Islamic Republic of Iran continued to provide access to 92,000 refugees through its national health insurance scheme, while seeking to increase the number of most vulnerable enrolled.\n\nRwanda also made significant progress, enrolling 12,000 refugees in its national health insurance scheme.\n\nUNHCR's aim was for people of concern to be included in national health policies and\n\nTo advance access to quality health care and related data, UNHCR rolled out iRHIS-its new integrated refugee health information system-in 18 countries hosting refugees in camps, including the DRC, Ethiopia, Iraq and Yemen. More than 7.3 million registered consultations took place across 179 sites. UNHCR and partners conducted quality of care assessments in sites or camps and 148 health facilities 71 in Bangladesh, Chad, Djibouti, Ethiopia,\n\nJordan, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Somalia,\n\nSouth Sudan, Sudan and Uganda using the balanced scorecard. The scorecard was designed to assess care quality in primary health care facilities. The average country scores ranged between 70% and 89%, well above the moderate range of 60%. Results were available immediately, allowing decisions to be made on capacity and other gaps at health facilities.\n\nUNHCR continued its mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) to people of concern, including by training\n\nBangladeshi psychologists working 26 with Rohingya refugees on interpersonal therapy for depression. The integration of mental health into primary health care continued in Burundi and Zambia, where 49 primary care staff in refugee settings were trained as part of the Mental Health Gap Action Programme.\n\nIn the last five years, 1,133 partner staff in countries completed the training, 14 significantly improving access to mental health services for refugees and host populations. In addition, UNHCR remained an active member of the IASC MHPSS\n\nReference Group and supported MHPSS efforts for IDPs through its Protection Cluster.\n\nA UNHCR initiative to improve non-communicable diseases care for people of concern saw approximately health staff from 12 countries receive 300 training and support introducing treatment protocols. These included participants from UNHCR, NGOs and government partners in countries such as Burundi, Cameroon and Ethiopia. UNHCR worked with the Centres for Disease Control and\n\nPrevention and national tuberculosis programmes to assess the challenges facing urban refugees and asylum-seekers needing health care in Cameroon and iRHIS, UNHCR's integrated refugee health information system\n\nDespite systems being inadequately equipped to meet their needs, and discrimination from some health care workers, most refugees could access HIV tests. Refugees were also confident they could get tuberculosis treatment in the health care system and stay in the country after a tuberculosis or HIV diagnosis.\n\nUNHCR developed a comprehensive approach to improving access to national systems for people of concern, which included greater partnership and coordination with national authorities and partners, translation services in health care facilities, translating information material into refugees' languages, sensitizing health care workers to refugees' needs and ensuring refugees' contact information was updated at each appointment.\n\nIn 2019, two-thirds of preventable maternal deaths and nearly half (45%) of newborn deaths occurred in countries affected by recent conflict, natural disaster or both. The majority (94%) of live births occurred with the assistance of skilled health personnel.

High levels of mobility, poor living conditions, exposure to violence and less access to health services are all contributing factors. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria remained a vital support to ensure refugees and IDPs could access quality disease prevention, treatment and care services.\n\nUNHCR and the United Nations Foundation (UNF) reviewed how refugees and IDPs were included in Global Fund applications between 2002-2019. The global results and downloadable scorecards for each eligible country were discussed with the Global Fund, to be shared with UNF partners. As part of the review and annual public health report, the team also analyzed how refugees benefit from country grants. The scorecards will help encourage national programmes to include refugees, IDPs and surrounding populations in proposals for the next three-year funding cycle (2021-2023).\n\n© UNHCR/Hugh Kinsella Cunningham\n\nWorking towards refugees' and IDPs' access to quality disease prevention and care services\n\nNUTRITION AND FOOD SECURITY including medicines and medical supplies, equipment, training and human resources.\n\nFurthermore, refugees' impact on national delivery systems should be assessed early on and monitored as the situation unfolds.\n\n© UNHCR/Martim Gray Pereira equipment, supplies, monitoring and community outreach to improve the quality and uptake of maternal, newborn and family planning services.\n\nTwo refugees working with the standardized expanded nutrition survey team in Pamir camp, South Sudan, take a blood sample from a four-year-old Sudanese refugee to screen for anemia.\n\n61% of surveyed sites in which levels of acute malnutrition were acceptable (<10%) of surveyed sites in which anemia levels were acceptable (<20%) compared to 2018 levels: 48% compared to 2018 levels: 5% of surveyed sites in which levels of stunting of surveyed sites met the UNHCR target (≥70%) for the rate of exclusive breastfeeding compared to 2018 levels: 32% compared to 2018 levels: 61%\n\nWhile malnutrition causes vary, food insecurity is a significant contributing factor among refugee and IDP populations, particularly for children. Malnutrition is a major challenge to protection and threatens development gains. UNHCR focuses on tackling it in all its forms, stressing the need for a multi-sectoral approach to nutrition and food security.\n\nThe collection and use of good quality data is pivotal to decision-making and targeted responses. The Standardized Expanded\n\nNutrition Survey, known as SENS, was updated in 2019. It aligns with international standards; with Sustainable Development\n\nGoal (SDG) 2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 203\n\nUNHCR's SENS\n\nUNHCR ensured robust methodologies for all nutrition surveys undertaken in 77 sites across 13 countries, 91% of which were in\n\nAfrica, predominantly in East and Central\n\nAfrica, to ensure the accuracy of data generated. It sought to prioritize the effects of rising malnutrition when funding and designing programmes for country operations. To make the data more accessible to other sectors and partners, the UNHCR SENS dashboard was developed, providing a comprehensive overview of all data and allowing analyses of nutrition and food security trends.\n\nThe information from nutrition surveys conducted in 13 countries during 2019 highlights the extremely precarious nutrition situation of refugee populations, notably in Ethiopia, Nigeria and Sudan. All forms of childhood malnutrition are at concerning levels. High stunting-indicative of longer-term nutritional deficits-was present in almost 50% of sites; high anemia in almost\n\n70% of sites; and global acute malnutrition\n\n(GAM) standards exceeded the 10% threshold in 39% of the sites monitored.\n\nWith malnutrition representing a significant concern for refugee populations, improving the prevention of undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies, and managing existing malnutrition cases, was a priority and challenge in 2019. In addition to treatment, UNHCR focused on preventing malnutrition in collaboration with other sectors. Poor infant and young child feeding (IYCF) is a major driver of malnutrition and, while exclusive breastfeeding levels among UNHCR operations are improving, complementary feeding indicators remain poor. The\n\nIYCF framework, which outlines the practical steps each sector can take to mitigate malnutrition, was rolled out at new sites in seven operations, including in Uganda and the United Republic of\n\nTanzania, with further roll out planned for 2020.\n\nThe IYCF framework has been implemented for the first time in an emergency context, resulting in a substantial reduction in child mortality in Gambella camp, while global acute malnutrition was nearly halved in Gambella and Melkadida camps.\n\nIn October 2019, the international conference \"Building innovative partnerships: tackling child malnutrition and achieving sustainable developments goals\" was organized in Barcelona, involving experts and stakeholders from the public and private sectors, providing innovative ideas for sustainable solutions.\n\nIn Bangladesh, following the influx of almost 1 million refugees in 2017 to the Cox's Bazar district, levels of\n\nGAM in the Kutupalong refugee camp were well above the emergency levels (≥15%) at 24.3%, with stunting and anemia also exhibiting extremely high prevalence.\n\nThis improved enrolment and use of nutrition services.\n\nWhile in 2018 only 27% of eligible children were enrolled in treatment programmes for severe acute malnutrition, this figure increased to 78% in 2019. Promotion of appropriate IYCF was also scaled up, with pregnant and lactating women receiving counselling while mother-to-mother support groups were established in communities to enhance the adoption of IYCF and health practices in the first 1,000 days of life.\n\nRefugee food security continued to deteriorate in many protracted situations where UNHCR operates, particularly in Africa. This was most concerning in contexts where drought was coupled with limited livelihood opportunities.\n\n\"la Caixa\" Banking Foundation supports innovation for tackling the issue of child malnutrition in Ethiopia through the MOM Project.\n\nNutrition services scale up in Bangladesh\n\nIn response, local and international actors ramped up efforts to reduce the overcrowded conditions by massively scaling up the extension areas. Efforts were also multiplied to ensure refugees had access to regular food distributions and to expand community management of acute malnutrition practices.\n\nLastly, UNHCR conducted a comprehensive five-day nutrition and food security training session in Nairobi for public health and nutrition staff with 28 staff from operations. Specialists from the region, 10 including from other agencies, shared their expertise, which promoted synergies between various sectors and agencies.\n\nThis training was the first to be held by UNHCR since 2011.\n\nTaking steps to fight child malnutrition in refugee camps promote sustainable agriculture) and the nutrition targets of SDG 2.2, which aims to end all forms of malnutrition by 2030; and with indicators and methodologies from agencies such as UNICEF and WFP.\n\nRefugee food security is largely dependent on humanitarian food assistance provided by WFP. Funding shortfalls resulted in basic needs not being met in Cameroon, Chad,\n\nEthiopia, Malawi, Kenya and South Sudan, among others. To deal with these challenges, refugees often put themselves at great risk leaving camps to search for income or livelihoods. Some migrated to mining areas. Women often took their children to the fields for weeks at a time, resulting in a break in access to health centres providing malnutrition prevention and treatment services and school.\n\nThe nutritional impact of food insecurity contributed to detrimental effects on the growth and development of refugee children at the most critical window of opportunity between conception and two years of age. Stunting levels increasing in 2019 could be a physical manifestation of this.\n\nUNHCR and WFP collaborated to address resource challenges by shifting from providing assistance to all, to targeting those most in need, increasing biometric verification in food assistance distribution, and jointly fundraising for additional support.\n\n% OF SURVEYED SITES MEETING\n\nTHE NUTRITION INDICATOR TARGETS\n\nGAM <10%\n\nStunting scenario <20%\n\nAnemia <20%\n\nExclusive breastfeeding >70%\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 205\n\n© UNHCR/Sebastian Rich disparities across UNHCR operations.\n\nIn some countries, such as Iraq, refugees and IDPs had their own household toilet, while in other operations such as Kepembele camp in the Republic of the Congo, as many as 110 people shared one toilet.\n\nMonitoring is key to addressing inequalities, enhancing UNHCR's accountability to affected populations, and mitigating financial and reputational risks to UNHCR.\n\nSmart monitoring technology was piloted in Iraq, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, and the\n\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, allowing\n\nUNHCR and partners to ensure service standards were maintained by tracking water trucking operations, the performance of water distribution networks, water levels in boreholes, and water quality.\n\nUNHCR also invested in cost-effective and environmentally-sustainable technologies, such as urine-diverting dry toilets that\n\nWATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SERVICES\n\nNumber of people\n\nWATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE\n\nPersons per drop-hole liters per person per day require little maintenance in hot and dry climates.

Specific tools in the training included: the global solar water initiative; tools to reduce the maintenance costs of water supply; real-time monitoring of\n\nWASH systems to improve effectiveness; and a suite of tools on applied hydrogeology and rapid groundwater potential mapping to improve the overall lifespan of WASH infrastructure.\n\nGaps in UNHCR's technical expertise remained. Only one region had WASH technical staff in 2019 and there were operations with WASH expenditure 17 but no technical WASH staff. In addition, and most importantly, the budget did not meet emergency needs, let alone ensure longer-term service sustainability.\n\nIn 2019, only 28% of the requested funding for WASH was allocated. UNHCR often operates in remote areas without pre-existing infrastructure. Establishing sustainable water and sanitation systems remained costly and takes significant time.\n\nSustainable infrastructure requires a larger cash injection from the outset; therefore, the Office faces the dilemma of targeting more people with emergency facilities or fewer with sustainable facilities.\n\nNor Kalam, 25, helps to prepare bamboo logs for chemical treatment at Kutupalong camp, Bangladesh.

To intensify UNHCR's efforts to become carbon neutral, solarizing camp and settlement water supply systems was identified as a key component of the UNHCR Clean Energy Challenge, announced at the Global Refugee Forum in 2019.

The Office improved the quality and type of shelter options, providing emergency shelter to more than 116,527 people of concern, while\n\n139,400 people of concern benefited from transitional shelter. However, mounting displacement meant at least half of emergency shelter needs went unmet.\n\nTo improve the living conditions of\n\n76,000 refugees and IDPs, 15,198 refugee housing units (RHUs) were deployed to\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 209\n\nCash for shelter operations. The majority (70%) went to 15 operations in Africa, and the remainder to the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, and the Middle East and North of Africa. Globally,\n\n219,000 people of concern were living in\n\nRHUs by the end of 2019 and, reflecting\n\nUNHCR's commitment to engage decisively and predictably in situations of internal displacement, 90,200 IDPs were living in a\n\nRHU by year's end, with a third of RHUs set aside for IDPs. With Better Shelter, UNHCR trained 450 additional staff, partners and people of concern in RHU assembly and safety standards across 15 operations.\n\nThroughout the year, UNHCR pursued comprehensive responses, which promoted progressive shelter solutions.\n\nThe aim was a more permanent solution for people of concern, including IDPs in\n\nBurkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic. People of concern received a holistic package of assistance that supported them to transition from emergency to more durable shelter and settlement solutions.\n\nUNHCR humanitarian settlements should promote local development and the inclusion of people of concern, so settlement profiling tools were developed with UN-Habitat. These allowed UNHCR to rapidly obtain information that could inform decision-making and sustainable investments in settlements housing people of concern. Settlement profiles were also developed for Ethiopia (Kebri Beyah) and Uganda (Nakivale). files to shelter strategies, drawing templates, guidelines, construction guidance, site planning reference, settlement maps and RHU guidelines. The SIP dashboard is a comprehensive community of practice, which also allows a more in-depth technical monitoring of sectoral activities in 690 settlements, covering both IDP and refugee contexts.\n\nAt the onset of emergencies, UNHCR deployed experts and increased its use of new technology and cash to improve shelter response, with cash assistance as an effective way to ensure people of concern had shelter. UNHCR scaled up cash assistance for immediate shelter needs, with 17 operations implementing cash for shelter programmes, including for IDPs in Burkina Faso, the DRC, Iraq, Somalia and Ukraine. Globally, households could buy shelter construction materials using cash grants (27,387) or vouchers (722); buy shelter-related core relief items using cash grants (7,524); or use cash grants to rent accommodation (86,426).\n\nThe technical capacity of staff, partners and people of concern was strengthened through comprehensive training sessions organized for 20 national shelter and settlement planners from 17 countries.\n\nUNHCR also facilitated peer-to-peer learning and opportunities to share lessons learned, and outlined ways to implement the \"Master Plan\" approach to settlement planning.\n\nAligned with institutional priorities for better data when implementing technical programmes, the settlement information portal (SIP) continued to grow and connect with other UNHCR information databases, including the cash assistance dashboards, the WASH portal, the health facility balanced scorecard, HALEP and emergency deployments dashboards, as well as the UNHCR operational portal. The SIP now contains more than\n\n4,000 documents, ranging from AutoCAD\n\nInsufficient funding, mounting or prolonged displacement, the growing impact of climate variability, difficult access to affected populations, limited technical capacity and challenging political environments, all remained significant barriers to UNHCR meeting the shelter needs of people of concern.\n\nIn Burundi, for example, UNHCR supported refugees and asylum-seekers living in\n\n© UNHCR/Caroline Gluck\n\nTo improve emergency preparedness and response, UNHCR developed revised shelter strategy templates and checklists to facilitate a prompt and efficient response.\n\nFor example, in Bangladesh, the response evolved from a transitional shelter-only approach to a multi-faceted one, also incorporating emergency upgrades and hazard preparedness, reflecting the dynamic nature of the conditions in Bangladesh where multiple shelter options are required. camps, including through sensitization activities and by providing shelter kits and materials. However, increased numbers of refugees arriving from the DRC saw funding diverted from the much-needed rehabilitation of existing shelters and infrastructure towards the construction of neighborhoods to accommodate new arrivals.\n\nAs a result, only 6,595 people of concern received shelter support instead of the\n\n10,000 intended, and only 1,530 shelter kits were distributed instead of the 2,000 that were originally planned.\n\nIn Myanmar, UNHCR and partners continued to prioritize reconstructing temporary shelters in camps hosting Rohingya.\n\nHowever, limited funding for shelter and the rapid degradation of temporary shelters\n\n(built to last two years) caused by local weather conditions meant that only 380 of the 800 communal shelters targeted for reconstruction could be rebuilt.\n\nRohingya refugee volunteers work to avert monsoon damage in Bangladesh\n\nVolunteers were at the forefront of a drive to protect residents of the sprawling refugee settlements as the cyclone and monsoon season approached.\n\nWhile humanitarian agencies strengthened essential infrastructure and pre-positioned relief items in the settlements, the shift in emergency planning is towards a community-centred approach.\n\nVolunteer community outreach members went house-tohouse, spreading information and awareness about how families can better protect themselves and their shelters.\n\nAt the same time, UNHCR focused on improving the fragile and densely-crowded refugee settlements, building kilometre after kilometre of roads, steps and bridges. Drainage, water and sanitation systems and upgraded shelters were installed and built, tie-down kits and plastic tarpaulins distributed to families, and emergency items pre-positioned.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 211\n\nT H E M AT I C C H A P T E R S I B U I L D I N G B E T T E R F U T U R E S\n\nT H E M AT I C C H A P T E R S I B U I L D I N G B E T T E R F U T U R E S\n\nBuilding\n\nBetter\n\nFutures\n\nThe affirmation of the Global Compact on\n\nRefugees in December 2018, and the first\n\nGlobal Refugee Forum, which took place a year later, created momentum for enhanced and innovative approaches to achieving solutions and resilience for refugees, returnees, the internally displaced and stateless persons.\n\nThe Forum saw significant pledges, some cross-cutting, made in the areas of education; energy; settlements; water, sanitation and hygiene; health and infrastructure; jobs and livelihoods; and solutions, including local integration and reintegration. Providing employment opportunities for refugees-crucial for allowing them to live in dignity and give back to the communities they reside in- also saw strong support. In addition to humanitarian and development pledges at the Forum, significant funding was pledged by business groups. At least 15,000 jobs will be made available to refugees through these initiatives, along with some 125,000 hours per year of pro bono legal counselling.\n\nThe Compact also called for the establishment of a global academic network on refugees, as well as other forced displacement and statelessness issues, to facilitate research, training and scholarship opportunities involving universities, academic alliances and research institutions. This network, the Global Academic Interdisciplinary Network, was launched at the Forum.\n\nIt builds on the many academic networks that individual UNHCR teams currently work with, both regional and thematic.\n\nAs it begins its work in 2020, it will focus on creating links between academics, policymakers and practitioners\n\nUm Nour, a Syrian returnee, was able to open a repair shop in Aleppo thanks to the grant she received from UNHCR's livelihoods programme.\n\n© UNHCR/Antwan\n\nChnkdji\n\nIn 2019, there were further advances in implementing the Comprehensive Refugee\n\nResponse Framework (CRRF) by vanguard countries, as well as a more 15 global uptake of the Compact's principles in support of refugee-hosting countries and\n\nDuring the year, more States reviewed their policies towards refugees and strengthened efforts to support self-reliance through socioeconomic inclusion, including by extending national services to refugees such as education systems and birth registration. In doing this, many developed multi-stakeholder approaches, drawing on the expertise and contributions of line ministries and other stakeholders, including the private sector. These efforts were supported by further investment from the development donor community, with increased financing and commitments to work more closely with humanitarian donors to achieve more harmonized and sustained support in nexus situations. For example,\n\nUNHCR-World Bank Group cooperation has supported policy changes to include refugees in national service delivery systems and ensure their economic inclusion, such as through improved access to labour markets.\n\nFurthermore, the affirmation of the Compact and the variety of pledges made at the\n\nForum have been accompanied by renewed enthusiasm among many States for resettlement and complementary pathways for refugees. These States recognize them as tangible, lifesaving mechanisms by which governments and communities across the world share responsibility for finding solutions for the increasing number of refugees worldwide. However, although expanding third-country solutions is a key objective of the Compact, in 2019 those solutions were still only available to a fraction of the world's refugees.\n\n• Delivering through partnerships\n\n• Voluntary return and local integration and solutions\n\n•\tResettlement and complementary pathways\n\n• Access to quality education\n\n• Livelihoods and economic inclusion\n\n• Strengthening city networks and supporting the urban displaced\n\n• Energy and environmental protection\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 213\n\nThe World Bank and UNHCR also completed comparable (nationals and refugees) socioeconomic data studies in Chad, Niger and Uganda and finalized a socioeconomic study comparing the Shona, a stateless population in Kenya, with citizens. The analysis from this data informs programming and policy, and it provides evidence with which to work in a more informed way with host governments, development and other partners.\n\nPartnerships were also strengthened with bilateral development actors, such as the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), the European Commission's Directorate-General for\n\nInternational Cooperation and Development (DEVCO) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).\n\nWith BMZ's support, an urbanization project supporting out-of-camp solutions in the Tillabery region of\n\nNiger began, with planned construction of social housing and services for 40,000 Malian refugees and host community members.

Mogadishu is home to nearly 400,000 IDPs, more than a third of the country's IDPs. More than half (55%) are concentrated in two of Mogadishu's peripheral districts and live in informal settlements within urban areas, a sign that protracted internal displacement is becoming an urban phenomenon.\n\nIn response, UNHCR identified collective aims to be achieved by 2022, including risk and vulnerability mitigation; strengthening the resilience of IDPs, refugee returnees and host communities; and searching for durable solutions for 100,000 displaced households.\n\nDespite complex security situations and fragile peace, UNHCR observed self-organized refugee and IDP returns to or within places like the Syrian Arab Republic (Syria) and South Sudan.

It also advocated including vulnerable returnees in existing aid programmes. In countries hosting\n\nSouth Sudanese refugees, a Regional\n\nIntention Survey was organized, to help prepare for possible returns. In Sudan,\n\nUNHCR and other UN agencies supported the Government in designing and launching a project to implement the peace process, with three main priority areas identified: rule of law, durable solutions and community peacebuilding. In Ethiopia, to make returns\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 217 more sustainable, refugees were included in a government-run national justice perception survey, with the report available in 2020.\n\nLocal integration and solutions\n\nEthiopia law grants more rights to\n\nRefugees' local integration is a complex and gradual process, comprising distinct but inter-related legal, economic, social and cultural dimensions, all of which are important for refugees' ability to integrate successfully as full members of society.\n\nCivil registration, documentation and legal stay options for refugees and asylum-seekers was a focus in several countries. In Zambia, UNHCR advocated issuing residence permits for 10,000 former\n\nAngolan refugees and 4,000 former\n\nRwandan refugees as part of the legal integration process. Namibia also began formalizing the residency and inclusion of former Angolan refugees. In Gambia and\n\nGuinea Bissau, more than 5,000 refugees gained citizenship in 2019. Some\n\n55,000 refugees were naturalized, a decrease of 12% compared to 62,600 in 2018. UNHCR and governments worked to improve refugees' access to adequate housing, exploring options to include them in national housing services and pursuing alternatives to camps, as in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, and in Niger.\n\nDuring the Global Refugee Forum, several countries pledged to advance and promote local integration and solutions. The DRC committed to offering 10-year residence permits to the\n\n200,000 Rwandan refugees who opted to stay in the DRC after their status clause ended, while the Government of Liberia pledged to provide land for agriculture and permanent housing to 5,000 locallyintegrated Ivorian refugees.\n\nSustainable voluntary repatriation is contingent on addressing the root causes of displacement. Despite some promising steps, many countries could not offer displaced populations safe and dignified returns.\n\nMore displaced people were gravitating towards urban centres rather than their places of origin, requiring a different response for housing, infrastructure and service delivery. Development actors needed greater understanding of trends in urbanization and increased engagement in support of refugees and host communities.\n\nSustainable reintegration was hindered in\n\nSudan when returnees did not receive their civil documentation, which was mainly available locally. As in several other contexts, access to land also remained a concern, leading to secondary displacement. Some IDP families in Iraq returned to camps after discovering partially damaged houses, homes occupied by relatives, or finding themselves unable to pay rent on return. UNHCR continued\n\n\"know-before-you-go\" campaigns as well as \"go-and-see\" visits to support access to reliable information ahead of returning.\n\nUNHCR welcomed Ethiopia's historic new refugee proclamation in January 2019, which enables refugees who have stayed in the country for a protracted period to locally integrate, if they wish to do so.\n\nThe Proclamation also provides refugees the right to acquire work permits; access primary education; obtain drivers' licenses; register life events, such as births and marriages; and open bank accounts. The\n\nAbuja Action Statement was reaffirmed, calling for proactive approaches to local integration and alternatives to camps. returnees rebuild their lives\n\nWhile parts of the country remain unstable because of the conflict that has now lasted for over five years, a recent peace agreement between the Government of the CAR and armed groups has brought security to other areas.\n\nUNHCR and partners are working closely with the Government and those of asylum countries to organize and assist refugees who have made an informed choice to voluntarily return to the CAR to do so in safety and in dignity.\n\nReturning from the Republic of Congo, Clavette Bodo is one of them, using the voluntary return money she received to rebuild her destroyed house in Mongoumba.\n\nFor those who choose to return, UNHCR and partners, including WFP, UNICEF and\n\nUNFPA, provide relocation support of three months of food and a modest cash grant, yellow fever vaccines, and sanitary kits for women. Altogether, 116,000 CAR refugees have voluntarily chosen to return home since 2016.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 219\n\nSomali refugees aboard a flight from Dadaab to be resettled in Sweden. refugees identified in need of resettlement, submitted for resettlement country operations submitted refugees compared to 81,337 in 2018 compared to 55,680 in 2018 compared to 82 in 2018\n\nAgainst a backdrop of continuing largescale forced displacement, resettlement and complementary pathways remained important tools for protection and solutions for some of the world's most vulnerable refugees as well as tangible demonstrations of solidarity and responsibility-sharing.\n\nIn total, 81 UNHCR operations submitted\n\n81,671 refugees to 29 countries for resettlement consideration. The majority\n\n(three-quarters) of those submitted in 2019 originated from just five countries: the Syrian Arab Republic (Syria, 29,660), the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n\n(DRC, 18,997), Afghanistan (5,892),\n\nSomalia (4,393) and Eritrea (3,147), all of which suffered from protracted conflict or insecurity.\n\nStates accepted more than 90% of the cases referred by UNHCR. The largest number of UNHCR-facilitated resettlement departures in 2019 were from five major refugee-hosting countries, including Turkey\n\n(10,558), Lebanon (8,359), Jordan (5,501), the United Republic of Tanzania (4,030) and Egypt (3,995). Women and girls comprised half (50%) of those submitted for resettlement and 52% were children, while urgent/emergency submissions represented 18% of all submissions.\n\nLifesaving mechanisms for evacuation, resettlement and other solutions were expanded by establishing a second facility in Rwanda, which opened on September 2019. In all, 878 people 10 mechanism in Niger; 393 people were evacuated to Italy; 452 were evacuated to\n\nRomania; and 306 to Rwanda, where the first seven evacuees later departed for resettlement.

In 2019, UNHCR and stakeholders launched the \"Three Year\n\n(2019-2021) Strategy on Resettlement and Complementary Pathways\". Its aim is to increase the number of refugees obtaining solutions through resettlement or complementary pathways by, for example, greater opportunities in education and labour, and its targets are ambitious.\n\nBy the end of 2028, the strategy aims to have 3 million refugees benefit from effective protection and solutions through resettlement (1 million refugees) in 50 resettlement countries and complementary pathways (2 million refugees).\n\nGLOBAL RESETTLEMENT SUBMISSIONS\n\nBY CATEGORY | 2019\n\nGLOBAL RESETTLEMENT\n\nDEPARTURES | 2015 -2019\n\nInd iv i du a l s\n\nRESETTLEMENT AND COMPLEMENTARY PATHWAYS\n\n140,000\n\n126,291\n\n105,000\n\n81,891\n\n65,108\n\n55,680\n\nLegal and/or physical protection needs\n\nSurvivor of violence and/or torture\n\nWomen and girls at risk\n\nLack of foreseeable alternative durable solutions\n\nZimbabwe | 2%\n\nZambia | 7%\n\nSouth\n\nAfrica Office | 9%\n\nMulti-Country\n\nMulti-Country Office | 9%\n\nMozambique | 3%\n\nMalawi | 7%\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 221\n\nMore than 63,000 refugees assisted by\n\nUNHCR were resettled in 2019, surpassing the 60,000 target.\n\nTo achieve these targets, in 2019 UNHCR enhanced its operational capacity.

The OECD-UNHCR study, \"Safe pathways for refugees\", was updated to include 2018 data, and discussions with non-OECD countries began for their inclusion in future editions.\n\nLess than 5% of global resettlement needs were met in 2019, meaning a small fraction of those at risk found a safe and lasting solution to their plight.\n\n© UNHCR/Annie Sakkab pathways for admission of refugees to third countries - Key considerations\n\nIn August 2019, a new Priority Situations\n\nCore Group was established, under the co-chairmanship of Ireland and Sweden, to boost support for resettlement and complementary pathways, facilitate joint advocacy between States and UNHCR, and maximize the impact of resettlement for refugees at risk in countries under the Syria and Central Mediterranean priority situations. UNHCR and IOM also launched the Sustainable Resettlement and Complementary Pathways\n\nInitiative, crucial for implementing the Three-Year Strategy. In line with the strategy, the initiative seeks to grow sustainable resettlement programmes and advance complementary pathways for admission through multi-stakeholder partnerships and targeted capacitybuilding of States and key actors.\n\nThe lack of consistent information-sharing among States and partners hindered the comprehensive and accurate counting of refugees accessing pathways separate from government-sponsored resettlement programmes. During the past few years,\n\nUNHCR has worked closely with resettlement States to conclude or revise data-sharing agreements that ensure the safe, secure and reliable transfer of data.\n\nFurther partnerships were needed to support people of concern who require legal, financial, and in-kind assistance to access complementary pathways. Overly restrictive visa requirements kept many refugees from accessing potentially life-changing programmes.\n\nSyrian software developer starts new life as Canadian skilled worker\n\nAfter eight years in Lebanon, Mohammed Hakmi is the first refugee to arrive in Canada as a skilled worker under an innovative pilot programme.\n\nBonfire Interactive, a Canadian tech company in Kitchener, Ontario, recently welcomed Mohammed to their team.\n\n\"We've got a great candidate who went through the same process other candidates go through, very high technical ability, good communication skills, everything you'd expect.\"\n\n-Corry Flatt, Bonfire's CEO.\n\nMohammed sees the model as \"a two-way benefit\" because employers are helping to change the lives of refugees for the better and, in return, they profit from their skills and talents.\n\nThis belief in a win-win situation is at the heart of Talent Beyond Boundaries (TBB), an organization that matches employers to refugees who have the skills they need, which is how Bonfire found Mohammed.\n\nIn Lebanon and Jordan, TBB has identified over 10,000 Syrian professionals in IT, engineering, trades, accounting and health care, most of the whom are unable to work, so their skills go unused.\n\nThe Canadian Government created an innovative pilot programme, called the Economic Mobility Pathways Project, to test the possibility for refugees to immigrate as skilled workers.\n\nMohammed is its first success story.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 223\n\nACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION\n\nEncouragingly, the education theme at the Global Refugee Forum received vast support, with 68 stakeholders, including 16 States, joining the Education Co-sponsorship Alliance.

Launched in\n\nSeptember 2019, the strategy outlines the\n\nOffice's approach to supporting refugee inclusion in national education systems, in line with the Compact and SDG 4\n\n(ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all). Activities to support the provision of quality education included construction of, or improvements to, school facilities; the distribution of teaching and learning materials; specialized teacher training; cash assistance for vulnerable households; and skills training, also linked with employment.\n\nRefugee enrolment in primary school rose from 61% to 63%, while secondary level enrolment increased from 23% to 24%.\n\nMore refugees were also accessing higher education, rising from 1% to 3%. Peer-topeer schemes were set up with UNHCR support, enabling operations to share challenges and lessons learned in facilitating refugee children's access to primary education in Cameroon,\n\nEgypt, Ghana, Iraq, Malaysia, Mexico,\n\nMozambique, Pakistan, Rwanda and South Sudan. These same 10 countries were also supported to prioritize refugee children's access to secondary education as part of the Secondary Youth Education\n\nInitiative, which promotes the inclusion of refugee learners in national education systems. In tertiary education, UNHCR's higher education scholarship programme,\n\nDAFI (Albert Einstein German Academic\n\nRefugee Initiative) continued to offer financial support to undergraduate refugees. UNHCR supported\n\n8,362 refugee students in 54 countries with a DAFI scholarship, with more than 2,643 newly-enrolled students. In 2019, the programme opened in Mexico,\n\nAfghanistan and Somalia, with additional focus on returnees in the latter two countries. UNHCR also supported the launch of the Tertiary Refugee Student\n\nNetwork, a global network of refugee students from different programmes, which is committed to the Office's goal of enabling 15% of refugee students to access higher education by 2030.\n\nIn 2019, more than 12,600 additional students were enrolled in digital blended programmes through the Connected\n\nLearning in Crisis Consortium including in bachelor and master's degrees, preparatory programmes and professional development. Consortium membership grew to 27 university and higher education partners in 21 countries, all dedicated to increasing access to blended higher education opportunities.

Further evidence could be found in the ambition\n\nIn situations where the legal framework and policy environment was not conducive with inclusion in national systems, children and youth may have had no educational alternatives besides parallel systems offering uncertified, poor quality education.\n\nMinistries of education in host countries may have lacked the capacity or support to meet the education needs of refugees and the internally displaced, particularly at the onset of an emergency. More area-based approaches where the host community is included were needed, as nationals often have similar or sometimes even worse educational conditions than refugees.\n\nAzeem Mohamed, 27, sells spices at his shop in Al-Asif Square market in Karachi, Pakistan.

This situation is similar for refugees, IDPs, stateless persons and asylum-seekers, with more than half living in urban settings, often in situations where essential services are overstretched or inaccessible and national social safety nets are not fully accessible. Refugees in urban settings live in privately hosted and out-of-camp individual accommodation. As recognized in the Global Compact on Refugees, city or municipal administrations are increasingly important for delivering protection, assistance and solutions to people of concern to UNHCR.\n\nIn 2019, the Office tackled both policy and operational challenges related to cities and urban displacement through integrated support to national and local governments to enable them to absorb the needs of people of concern. To support cities in this endeavour, UNHCR also provided refugees and others of concern with cash assistance for basic needs covering rent and essential items, while facilitating education, child protection and mitigating sexual and gender-based violence. The Office also established community outreach networks as well as complaints and feedback mechanisms. It provided identification and documentation, engaged in case management and legal advice, and monitored protection concerns.\n\nIn 2019, the partnership with UN-Habitat delivered the first draft of \"Guidance for responding to displacement in urban areas\", as well as assessment methodologies, including settlement profiling tools that prioritize developing interventions in settlements. The tools are applicable at any scale, including in urban areas, and build on several years of development and implementation of the \"Master Plan\" process for sustainable settlements. They were used in 2019 in Kebribeyah, Ethiopia, and Nakivale, Uganda, for multi-sectoral spatial assessment and to plan future\n\nThe presence of large refugee or IDP populations in urban areas can strain the capacities of local authorities and put pressure on basic social services, such as education, health, housing, civil documentation, justice, and water and waste management. At the operational level, UNHCR adapted how protection and assistance are delivered. With\n\nUN-Habitat, it deployed technical experts to urban settlements. For example, an urban planning specialist in Cox's Bazar,\n\nBangladesh, carried out detailed planning and analysis inside Kutupalong camp and across the district with local government.\n\nThis produced a detailed district settlement profile, which supported the Asian\n\nDevelopment Bank and Government stakeholders' understanding and prioritizing of current needs and future investments in the area, benefiting both\n\nShelter and settlement response strategies covering urban contexts were developed for Iraq, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic, Ukraine and Yemen. Globally, most people of concern to UNHCR in urban areas live in privately hosted and individual accommodation. While finding safe and affordable housing is a challenge for everyone in the lower economic strata, refugees and IDPs can face additional barriers, such as not knowing how to find, or not being able to secure, somewhere to rent; not possessing the necessary rental documentation; and not understanding local, informal rental mechanisms.\n\nUNHCR's \"Rental assistance guidelines\" facilitated a standardized approach to establishing cash-for-rent programmes for all people of concern to UNHCR.\n\nCities stand #WithRefugees at the Global Refugee Forum\n\nUNHCR sought to anchor cities' implementation of the Compact in international refugee and migrant policy fora, including in the lead up to the Global Refugee Forum. More than 50 pledges directly involving local authorities, and those given through the efforts of global city networks were made. Pledges by international organizations, NGOs and academic institutions included engagement with local authorities varying from capacity-building efforts to addressing the challenges of including the forcibly displaced in urban areas.\n\nPledges were made by cities ranging from Bristol to Milan and São Paulo at the Global Refugee Forum. Bristol pledged to create a bespoke programme facilitating refugee entrepreneurship with local businesses and civil society. Milan pledged to pilot a municipal website to expand and strengthen in-person services, facilitating access to verified and updated information about hiring procedures for asylum-seekers and employers. São Paulo committed to creating the city's first municipal migration policy, in consultation with hundreds of locally-elected migrant and refugee representatives.\n\nDurban (eThekwini municipality), in South Africa, pledged to improve social cohesion between refugees and host community members. It also committed to set up \"one-stop shops\" to provide information, as well as linguistic and cultural mediation, for migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers, so they could effectively access health care, education and welfare services. Advocacy efforts were also strengthened through the\n\nCities #WithRefugees initiative, which recognizes the importance of municipalities as advocacy and communications partners.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 231\n\nWhile rental support was scaled-up in urban contexts, there were in-kind solutions in many locations. In cities across\n\nArgentina (400), Bolivia (516), Chile (933) and Paraguay (112), 1,961 people of concern were assisted with transitional shelter.\n\nIn Argentina, UNHCR provided food and non-food items, as well as home appliances, to vulnerable Venezuelans in four cities. The Office also supported infrastructure improvements in community shelters run by civil society 12 organizations and local governments, providing shelter to 400 people of concern, including 200 women. In\n\nSantiago, Chile, UNHCR provided financial and technical support to seven community shelters hosting Venezuelan families.\n\nFinancial support was given to five partners so they could refer people to alternative emergency accommodation in the cities of Antofagasta, Arica, Iquique and Santiago.\n\nMastura Ekhlas, an Afghan refugee, arrived in Germany in 2013. On inquiring at the job centre, she found\n\nVolkswagen had a year-long qualification programme for refugees at its huge plant and logistics centre in Baunatal and, once accepted, gave everything to impress her superiors.\n\nVolkswagen's programme started in 2017 and has helped 5,000 refugees across its sites. Its entry qualification couples a traditional programme with extra language tuition to help newcomers find their feet in the German workplace.\n\nDespite some notable success, multiple challenges remained for displaced populations in cities. Refugees faced numerous disadvantages; these include lack of community support systems, uncertain legal status and legal restrictions, cultural and linguistic differences, exclusion from social security systems or health insurance schemes, and insufficient income or support to meet even half of their basic needs, such as rent or food. Stigma and discrimination also reduced access to already overstretched government\n\nThanks to solar lighting, a Burundian refugee studies in his refugee housing unit in Kigoma refugee camp, in the United Republic of Tanzania.\n\nRefugees get traction in Germany's auto industry\n\nENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION\n\nReflecting UNHCR's commitment to stepping up responses in all IDP contexts, significant support was provided to urban IDP operations. In South Sudan, where\n\n12,147 IDPs received shelter and infrastructure assistance, significant numbers of those receiving assistance were in, or returning to, urban areas such as Bentiu and Juba.\n\n© UNHCR/Clemence Eliah\n\nThe guidelines were implemented during the Venezuela situation, as well as in Iraq, Libya, Mexico, and Nigeria. people of concern had access to a sustainable tons of CO2 emissions reduced by using cleaner sources of energy compared to 200,000 in 2018 compared to 18,120 in 2018\n\nUNHCR field offices participated in the\n\nUN-wide environmental inventory country operations where plastic waste audits were completed compared to 10 in 2018 compared to 2 in 2018\n\nIn 2019, UNHCR scaled up its work to improve people of concern's access to sustainable and clean energy and bolster the environmental protection of refugeehosting areas. By strengthening collaborations with partner agencies, it increased its technical capacity in the field.\n\nFor example, NorCap and the Swedish Civil\n\nContingencies Agency supported the deployment of six energy and two environmental experts, respectively, to UNHCR field locations.\n\nIn line with UNHCR's integrated approach, highlighting the key relationship between energy, environment and WASH, UNHCR's partnership with Engineers Without Borders\n\nNorway helped solve challenges with solid waste management. By the end of 2019, waste audits were completed in camps in\n\nAlgeria and Zambia, leading to a plastic waste processing and recycling proposal, which received support from donors with funding for innovative projects. Similar support was received for a \"trash to cash\"\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 233 project in Ethiopia, with the Norwegian\n\nGeotechnical Institute managing the project in Melkadida refugee camp, in partnership with the Norwegian Refugee Council and with UNHCR support. The project will improve solid waste management in the camp and create job opportunities in the plastic recycling facility for approximately refugees and members of the host 15 community. In the long-term, more people are likely to benefit as the project upscales in size and location, and it will also give the wider community the opportunity to collect plastic and sell it to the recycling facility.\n\nCollaboration between UNHCR and Land\n\nLife Company, a Dutch social enterprise, led to the establishment of the first ever green refugee camp, in Minawao, Cameroon. The project provided environmentally-sustainable shelter and cooking solutions, while protecting the environment through reforestation. The cocoon technology applied in this project, and replicated in Sudan, has significantly increased the survival rate of trees planted in refugee-hosting areas. In 2019, the project was selected as a global best practice for delivering on the SDGs.\n\nIn a bid to have a more comprehensive picture of the energy data and capacity in operations worldwide, UNHCR partnered with the Global Plan of Action for Sustainable Energy Solutions (GPA) in 2019. The GPA brings together UN and development agencies, the private sector,\n\nNGOs, research institutions and donors to develop responses that improve access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy services for forcibly displaced people and their hosting areas.\n\nUNHCR also collaborated with GIZ to improve access to electricity and cooking fuel in refugee hosting areas and boost sustainable energy use at UNHCR compounds in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda.\n\nThe project targets three main interventions: improving the policy framework in the energy sector in support of the CRRF; market-based access to sustainable energy for UNHCR infrastructure; and access to sustainable energy for households, businesses and social institutions.\n\nUNHCR also scaled up its contribution to\n\nUN-wide sustainability targets by better monitoring carbon emissions. In 2019,\n\nUNHCR offices participated in the 100 environmental inventory, which covers emissions of greenhouse gases, waste generation and water use-up from 10 in 2018. This enabled UNHCR to estimate its total emissions and offset them, being declared carbon neutral for the first time.\n\nA Sida-commissioned study demonstrated that converting field offices from diesel fuel to solar energy could have a positive carbon and financial impact. Based on this,\n\nSida committed seed funding to establish an internal UNHCR green fund that would help convert its offices. Renewable energy will be provided through private sector independent power producers and savings will be reinvested in future conversions.\n\nUNHCR and its partners successfully scaled-up the liquefied petroleum gas\n\n(LPG) programme in Bangladesh, which not only reduced deforestation and net carbon emissions but also diminished the risk to women and girls of sexual and genderbased violence (SGBV). A 2019 survey conducted by IUCN showed that the distribution of LPG in the camp meant a\n\nRohingya family currently only uses one kilo of firewood per day, compared to 4.76 kilos before the LPG distribution programme. As household demand for firewood fell by 80% in the Rohingya camp, so did the need for firewood collection from the forest-one of the causes of\n\nSGBV in refugee-hosting areas (see the Climate Action Overview for more details).\n\nUNHCR continues to seek innovative and cost-effective means of delivering environmentally-sound services to people of concern, while greening its own operations.\n\nUNHCR increasingly mainstreamed environmental concerns in its various activities and sectors-through its choice of shelter materials and during procurement-minimizing, as far as possible, subsequent adverse environmental impacts.\n\nThere has been a net increase in the number of people of concern having access to sustainable cooking fuel in 2019, but about 80% of UNHCR's people of concern still rely on unclean and unsustainable energy for their cooking needs. UNHCR is therefore collaborating with the Global LPG Partnership on a concept note for a global LPG market creation fund for refugees, for which\n\nUNHCR will be seeking international community support.\n\nGlobal Strategy for Sustainable Energy and the Clean Energy Challenge\n\nIn October 2019 UNHCR developed and launched the \"Global strategy for sustainable energy 2019-2024\". The strategy aims to ensure that the priority energy needs of people of concern for cooking, lighting and heating are safely and sustainably met, supporting both refugees and host communities. In December 2019 at the Global\n\nRefugee Forum, the High Commissioner launched the Clean Energy Challenge underlining that its aim is for \"all refugee settlements and nearby host communities\n\nGlobal StrateGy to have access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy by 2030\".\n\nThe Challenge sets an ambitious and forward-looking agenda, pushing to do more around a measurable target that helps refugees and host communities to access clean energy, while also delivering on commitments towards climate action. The Challenge is aligned to the SDGs and speaks to SDG 7 (ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all). for SuStainable enerGy\n\nA UNHCR StRAtegy 2019-2024\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 235\n\nC A M PA I G N S A N D G O O D W I L L A M B A S S A D O R S\n\nC A M PA I G N S A N D G O O D W I L L A M B A S S A D O R S\n\nPUBLIC CAMPAIGNS AND GOODWILL AMBASSADOR SUPPORT\n\nSimilarly, 25 faith actors came together to communicate their commitment to upholding the dignity of refugees through offering effective protection, access to social services, fulfilment of human rights and enhancing peacebuilding efforts.\n\nSince 2016, the #WithRefugees Coalition has focused the support of powerful civil society entities in the worlds of faith, sport, education, business, technology, and humanitarianism to drive action and keep refugee inclusion on the global agenda. By the end of 2019 the\n\nCoalition's membership had grown to 500 companies, universities, foundations, faith-based organizations, and youth groups, and had members in 82 countries. In 2019 the Coalition amplified key communication milestones such as World Refugee Day and UNHCR's annual\n\nEducation Report, and its thematic groups made important commitments at the Global Refugee Forum.\n\nWatch the video\n\n\"What does it mean to be stateless ?\"\n\nUNHCR's ten year #IBelong Campaign to End Statelessness reached its mid-point in 2019, marked by a High-Level Segment on Statelessness during the Executive Committee meeting in October. Throughout the year, positive actions by governments and NGOs towards the Campaign's goals were highlighted, most notably the Kyrgyz Republic becoming the first country to resolve all known cases of statelessness, an achievement reflected in the choice of 2019's Nansen Refugee Award winner.\n\nPublic campaigns\n\nAs part of its advocacy to raise empathy and increase support for refugees, IDPs and stateless persons, UNHCR strives to engage audiences through broad-based platforms such as World Refugee Day, the Nansen Refugee Award and the #IBelong Campaign to\n\nCities\n\n#WithRefugees initiative\n\n\"Take a Step With\n\nRefugees\" video series For World Refugee Day, UNHCR launched a global challenge to #StepWithRefugees.\n\nThousands of people walked, ran, danced, cycled or took inspiring steps in support of refugees. Similarly, the private sector campaign, 2 Billion Kilometres to Safety, launched in 2019, engaged over 110,000 new supporters who covered 30 million km in solidarity with refugees. The campaign raised UNHCR's profile through promotion at major (sporting) events, fitness apps, media and social media coverage and partnerships, and reached over 870 million people worldwide.\n\nUNHCR also launched its 2019 World Tour, resulting in 280 solidarity events in 190 cities around the world. From food and music festivals to community walks and 10 km runs, the narrative reinforcing better inclusion of refugees was loud and clear. More than 225 cities across some 50 countries added their support to a global statement of welcome and inclusiveness for families forced to flee. The statement is part of UNHCR's year-old Cities #WithRefugees initiative. The \"Take a Step With Refugees\" video series also highlighted shared values between six refugees and their welcomers in Beirut, Denver, Kuala Lumpur, Nairobi, Paris and Panama City.\n\n©UNHCR/Mark Henley A refugee student delegation visits Free University of Berlin on World Refugee Day 2019 in Germany.\n\nThe Nansen Refugee Award\n\nSince the Nansen Refugee Award was established in 1954, more than 60 people, groups and organizations have been acknowledged for their dedication and outstanding work on behalf of forcibly displaced people.\n\nMr. Azizbek Ashurov, a lawyer whose work was crucial in the efforts of the Kyrgyz Republic in becoming the first country in the world to end statelessness, was honoured as the 2019 winner.\n\nThe Award recognized Mr. Ashurov's dedication over sixteen years in helping thousands of people gain Kyrgyz nationality after they became stateless following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe monetary prize of $150,000, jointly donated by the Norwegian and Swiss Governments, will be used by Mr. Ashurov to focus on the prevention of future statelessness in the Kyrgyz Republic and the region, with the opening of a centre for legal identity and nationality in Osh, and on setting up legal clinics for law students.\n\nFive regional winners were also honoured with Nansen Refugee Award certificates. These were Mr. Évariste Mfaume, the founder of NGO Solidarité des Volontaires pour l'Humanité in the Democratic\n\nRepublic of the Congo, who champions the rights of Congolese people displaced by conflict as well as the rights of refugees and their host communities; Ms. Bianka Rodriguez, a trans woman and executive director of NGO COMCAVIS TRANS who advocates for the rights of forcibly displaced LGBTI persons in El Salvador;\n\nMr. Alberto Cairo, a physiotherapist in Afghanistan and head of the International Committee of the Red\n\nCross orthopaedic programme, who for 30 years has worked in Afghanistan to provide prosthetics and help find jobs for injured Afghans; Humanitarian Corridors, a cross-border initiative established with the Italian Government in 2015 to enable particularly vulnerable refugees to start a new life in safety in Italy; and Mrs. Abeer Khreisha, a community volunteer in Jordan, known as \"the mother of Syrians\" for her work helping refugees.\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 237\n\n\"We all have an individual duty should [...refugees] reach our own doorstep in search of safety and sanctuary that we welcome them.\"\n\n© UNHCR/Pierre Albouy\n\n-Khaled Hosseini, novelist and UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador\n\nWith the support of a core group of diverse and committed UNHCR Goodwill Ambassadors, celebrity supporters and influencers around the world, 2019 was another impactful year for UNHCR in leading the global narrative on the refugee cause. By generously donating their time and harnessing their networks, they raised awareness, leveraged fundraising, and amplified refugee voices. Their advocacy included 73 missions across 27 countries, reaching new and existing audiences in the hundreds of millions across a variety of media platforms. Their support also bolstered partnerships and helped raise millions of dollars.\n\nBy conveying the humanity of the refugee story through innovative and creative projects, they inspired empathy, uniting people in their commitment to make a real difference in the lives of the forcibly displaced and their hosts.\n\nPlatforms were provided for young refugee advocates such as UNHCR high-profile supporter and Syrian refugee trainee pilot, Maya Ghazal who brought her personal story and her powerful advocacy to many events during the year, including at the Global Refugee Forum, where she spoke about the importance of education. With determination, hope and resilience Maya has started a new life in the UK and is currently studying Aviation\n\nEngineering at Brunel University with the aspiration of becoming the first female Syrian refugee pilot. Pictured with her, after her inaugural solo flight, was British actor Douglas Booth, who has supported UNHCR since 2015. He met in Sicily with survivors of the Mediterranean sea crossing, and with families resettled through safe and legal pathways.\n\nThe Global Refugee Forum enjoyed the prominent backing of UNHCR celebrity supporters and refugee advocates via the #EveryoneCounts campaign. The campaign galvanized expressions of solidarity for its core message that \"everyone has a role to play\", by promoting inclusion, compassion and tolerance, while giving refugees a voice and opportunities to positively impact society. The main campaign video was viewed 7 million times. Other dialogues between supporters and refugee advocates, such as Goodwill Ambassador\n\nBen Stiller and South Sudanese model and former refugee Adut Akech, elevated the stories of refugees in public debate and discourse in countries around the world.\n\n#EveryoneCounts multi ambassador film\n\nElsewhere, UNHCR supporter and Iraqi refugee, Aya Mohammed Abdullah, joined highprofile speakers to champion refugee voices at The Imagine Forum: Women for Peace, in Iceland; while UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador and Sudanese refugee, Emi Mahmoud's powerful and poignant slam poetry at the Sziget festival in Hungary went viral with 1.3 million views on social media.\n\nThrough a powerful and insightful interview with activist Maha Mamo at the High-Level\n\nSegment on Statelessness, Goodwill Ambassador Cate Blanchett brought prominence to the global plight of an estimated 10 million stateless persons.\n\n© László Mudra/Rockstar Photographers\n\nU N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 239\n\nEXCOM MEMBERS\n\nAND PARTIES TO CONVENTIONS\n\nMEMBERS OF UNHCR's EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\n\nAND STATES PARTIES TO THE REFUGEE AND\n\nSTATELESSNESS CONVENTIONS\n\n1951 1967\n\nUNHCR is governed by the United Nations General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). In 1958,\n\nECOSOC established the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme (ExCom), pursuant to a resolution of the General Assembly. Its main tasks are to approve the High Commissioner's programmes, advise the High Commissioner in the exercise of his functions and oversee the Office's finances and administration.\n\nExCom holds an annual session in Geneva every October. The 70th session took place from 7 to 11 October 2019.
