According to the Mid-Year Humanitarian Requirements Document (HRD), 8.5 million people will need food assistance in the second half of 2017. In addition, there are 4 million people with transitory needs (receiving assistance through the Government's Protective Safety Net Programme).\n\n The early-September IRI/CPC ENSO forecast suggests an increased likelihood of La Niña between October 2017 and February 2018. La Niña events are typically associated with below-average rainfall between October and December. Since 2015, Ethiopia has had consecutive poor rainy seasons, lower than expected rainfall in this Deyr (winter) season could lead to further deterioration of food security.\n\n In the Somali region, WFP plans to provide 3.7 million people with emergency relief assistance (HRD+ PSNP) from November until the end of the year. This includes newly displaced people as a result of conflict.\n\n Inter communal conflicts along the Oromia-\n\nSomali border have displaced over 500,000 people in both regions. WFP will provide emergency food and nutrition support to 300,000 IDPs in the Somali Region and will expand its nutrition programmes in Oromia to support approximately 110,000 displaced children and mothers.\n\n6-Month Net Funding Requirements (Nov 2017- Apr 2018)\n\nRelief (HRD)\n\nPSNP*\n\nNutrition\n\nRefugees\n\nUSD 5 million\n\nUSD 38 million\n\nUSD 9 million\n\nUSD 33 million 4.4 m People assisted\n\nSept - Oct 2017\n\n51% 49%\n\nSeptember - October 2017\n\nIn Numbers Over 10 million people in Ethiopia in need of food assistance in the second half of 2017.\n\n3.3 million people in the Somali Region received emergency relief assistance from WFP.\n\n500,000 children, and pregnant and nursing mothers nationwide, received specialized nutritious food to prevent and treat moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) from WFP.\n\n600,000 refugees received WFP assistance.\n\nWFP Ethiopia 2017 Emergency Situation Report #06\n\nHighlights  WFP will target 5.5 million people in Ethiopia with food, cash and nutrition assistance from November through December 2017 and 5.8 million people from January through April 2018.\n\n WFP will initiate a six-month cash pilot to reach 588,000 PNSP and HRD beneficiaries in 10 woredas (districts) of the Somali Region in November 2017.\n\n Thanks to generous contributions from donors, in\n\nOctober, WFP has been able to increase rations for refugee to 80 of the entitlement (from 73 percent in July 2017).\n\nPage | 2 WFP Ethiopia Emergency Situation Report #06 September- October 2017\n\nWFP Response\n\nRelief Assistance\n\n Due to security concerns at the Oromia-Somali regional border in mid-September, food dispatches and distributions were delayed by two to three weeks.\n\n From November, WFP plans to provide 3.7 million people with emergency relief assistance (HRD+ PSNP) in the Somali Region until the end of the year. This includes assistance to an estimated 300,000 conflict related IDPs.\n\n WFP's is providing relief and PSNP assistance in the Somali Region through a combination of modalities based on needs; in- kind food assistance; food \"top ups\" (vegetable oil and pulses) to people receiving cash assistance from the Government; and a cash pilot project.\n\n From November through December, WFP is targeting 1.2 million children under five and pregnant or nursing women country wide with nutrition support to prevent and treat malnutrition in districts across the country where risks are highest.\n\n In September, WFP assisted over 500,000 children under five and pregnant and nursing women affected by moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) through the Targeted Supplementary Feeding Programme (TSF) nationwide.\n\n In partnership with the Somali Regional State\n\nDisaster Prevention Preparedness Bureau, the Regional Health Bureau, and NGOs, WFP will implement a four-month Blanket Supplementary Feeding Programme (BSFP) in 45 districts with the highest malnutrition rates in the Somali Region from November. Through this intervention, approximately 400,000 children and mothers will receive WFP support.\n\n The number of refugees seeking asylum in Ethiopia increased three fold in the past month; from 9,000 in August to 27,000 in September. An estimated 92 percent of the new refugees are from South Sudan.\n\n Thanks to generous contributions from donors, in October, WFP has been able to increase rations for refugee to 80 of the entitlement (from 73 percent in July 2017).\n\n WFP has expanded its operations to include refugees in SNNPR for the first time. Food for 3,000 new arrivals in South Omo Zone has been allocated for the October distributions.\n\n In September, WFP assisted over 600,000 refugees with 7,800 mt of assorted commodities and US$ 483,000 through cash based transfers.\n\nSupply Chain\n\nLogistics\n\n Security at the Oromia-Somali regional border remains a concern. In order to avoid future delays, commodities are being dispatched through alternative routes to reach targeted areas.\n\nUN Humanitarian Air Service\n\n In October, UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) transported 555 people and 2.1 mt of cargo, supported 37 organizations and carried out 16 medical evacuations. In addition, WFP airdropped 3,600 mt of food commodities form Jimma and Gambella in Ethiopia to South Sudan.\n\nResourcing Update\n\nTop Five Donors in 2017\n\n United States (US$ 144 million), the
