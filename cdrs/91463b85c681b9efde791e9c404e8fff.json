It reflects the Organization's view of how it will need to develop over a five-year period, in order to effectively address complex challenges and seize the many opportunities migration offers to both migrants and society. It responds to new and emerging responsibilities - including membership in the United Nations and coordination of the United Nations Network on Migration - as we enter the Decade of Action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. As part of the implementation of the Strategic Vision, I asked each of the Regional Offices to develop its own strategic priorities for the 2020-2024 period, integrating key elements of the Vision to respond to emerging needs within the region.\n\nThis regional strategy reflects the essential role that IOM plays in the field of human mobility: protecting, assisting and supporting migrants across the world, developing effective responses to the shifting dynamics of migration, and serving as a key source of advice on migration policy, research, data and practice. It also highlights the critical work that IOM undertakes in emergency situations, developing the resilience of communities and mobile populations, and particularly those in vulnerable situations, while building capacity within governments to manage all forms and impacts of mobility.\n\nMost importantly, this strategy highlights the current and future regional and cross-regional trends and challenges with respect to migration and situations of displacement, and outlines how IOM will seek to address them, including through collaboration with United Nations agencies and other partners.\n\nI would like to thank colleagues at all levels of the Organization - and particularly at the regional and country levels - for their diligent and insightful work in developing this strategy, which places IOM's global strategic objectives in context and sets out a course of action to achieve them. It is particularly timely, given the high salience of human mobility in public discourse, and as operational needs on the ground, particularly in the humanitarian sphere, are becoming more complex in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nUnder this strategy, IOM colleagues will engage with a wide range of stakeholders in all countries in the region, along with key regional bodies, including economic communities, consultative processes and multilateral forums, on the priorities it sets out. I and all my colleagues look forward to working with you over the next years to ensure that migration is safe, orderly and regular for the benefit of all. Together, we can respond to the needs and aspirations of migrants and displaced populations around the world, building societies fit for a modern, mobile and interconnected world.\n\nAntónio Vitorino Director General International Organization for Migration\n\nREGIONAL STRATEGY 2020-2024 iv\n\nIt is my great pleasure to launch this regional strategy for the East and Horn of Africa, which is centred around the human rights of migrants, the strategic priorities of our Member States and the mobility dimensions of the regional integration agenda of the African Union and the Regional Economic Communities, in particular the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the East African Community (EAC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). It provides a gender-sensitive framework for engaging with partners to facilitate mobility; promote inclusion; provide assistance and protection to people at risk or affected by crisis; mitigate drivers of, and promote durable solutions to, displacement and irregular migration; reduce the incidence of irregular migration; and promote improved governance of migration in the region and beyond. It is my hope that this strategy becomes a useful and living tool for IOM missions in the region for supporting Member States in leveraging migration for sustainable development and ensuring that \"no one is left behind\".\n\nMohammed Abdiker Regional Director East and Horn of Africa International Organization for Migration\n\nREGIONAL STRATEGY 2020-2024 v\n\nCONTENTS\n\nForeword iii\n\nAcronyms and short names vi 1.

Respect for the rights, dignity, empowerment and well-being of all migrants and (associated) communities remains paramount. In addition to the values enshrined in the IOM Constitution, the Organization continues to adhere to the core United Nations values of integrity, professionalism, equality and respect for diversity, ensures that it is accountable to its beneficiaries, and plays an active role in preventing sexual exploitation and abuse. IOM also continues to assist governments in their effective implementation of international standards in its programming.\n\nSince early 2020, the East and Horn of Africa region has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While short-term impacts are already being felt most acutely by vulnerable groups, the longer- term and socioeconomic, development-related and humanitarian consequences are yet to be fully determined. These outcomes will continue to impact the needs of migrants and other populations on the move, host communities and governments, and must, therefore, be fully reflected in IOM programming, which has already shifted in response. This strategy should, therefore, be read in light of these developments and will be reviewed periodically to ensure the necessary response to address ongoing and emerging impacts of the pandemic and other significant regional and global developments.\n\n1 1. INTRODUCTION 1. INTRODUCTION 2\n\nIn November 2019, IOM presented its Strategic Vision 2019-2023,1 which outlines three strategic pillars - resilience, mobility and governance - and builds on the recognition, in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, that migration is a multidimensional reality of major relevance for the development of countries of origin, transit and destination, and of the positive contributions of migrants to inclusive growth and sustainable development. It embraces the commitment in the 2030 Agenda and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration to cooperate internationally to ensure safe, orderly and regular migration, with full respect for human rights and humane treatment of migrants regardless of migration status.\n\nOver the next five years, IOM will be consolidating its efforts in the East and Horn of Africa (EHoA)2 to enhance migrants' and migration's contribution to sustainable development, as reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the African Union's Agenda 20633 and promoted in  IOM's institution-wide approach to  migration and sustainable development,4 contributing to the United Nations Decade of Action on the SDGs. IOM will pursue this by working more strategically with its Member States, the African Union and the regional economic communities (RECs), including by supporting key strategic priorities as defined in national development plans and regional and continental frameworks. Key to this will be the mainstreaming of migration in development planning and in the rollout of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks (UNSDCFs) and the associated United Nations Common Country Analyses (CCAs), and the building of stronger partnerships within the United Nations Development System  and beyond. Supporting mobility dimensions of continental and regional integration will also be essential, in partnership with the African Union, RECs (such as the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the East African Community (EAC)), and individual Member States, as well as other forms of regional cooperation.\n\nHarnessing the potential of migration for development will be particularly important in addressing the socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in view of its likely impact on migration, migrants and the economies of the region over the coming five years. Given the evolving and unpredictable nature of COVID-19, its full effects and impacts on the strategic direction of IOM in the region are yet to be established and will be further assessed through regular updates to this regional strategy. Throughout its programming, IOM will pursue gender equality, as this is central to the causes and consequences of migration - and, thus, for effective organizational responses in pursuit of its objective of safe, humane and orderly migration for all, so that no one is left behind.\n\nIOM, IOM Strategic Vision 2019-2023: Setting a Course for IOM (C/110/INF/1) (Geneva, 2019). Available at https://governingbodies.iom.int/ system/files/en/council/110/C-110-INF-1%20-%20IOM%20Strategic%20Vision.pdf. 2 IOM's geographical denomination of the East and Horn of Africa includes Burundi, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania; its geographical denomination of the Horn of Africa includes Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia. 3 Agenda 2016 was adopted in 2013 as Africa's 50-year strategic framework for inclusive and sustainable development. 4 IOM, IOM Institutional Strategy on Migration and Sustainable Development (Geneva, 2019). Available at https://publications.iom.int/books/ 1 iom-institutional-strategy-migration-and-sustainable-development.\n\nIOM will prioritize assistance to Member States in the governance of migration, including by ensuring coherent, whole-of-the-United Nations support for the implementation of and follow-up to the Global Compact for Migration through the United Nations Networks on Migration, and by providing more effective policy support. In line with the IOM Migration Data Strategy, the Regional Data Hub (RDH) for the EHoA region will inform effective migration management and evidence-based, strategic and policy-level discussion on migration, through supporting timely, quality, disaggregated and harmonized migration data, in line with the commitments in the Global Compact for Migration and the 2030 Agenda.5\n\nRecognizing the persistent vulnerability of migrants in irregular situations, IOM will assist migrants in transit and through assisted voluntary return and reintegration (AVRR), while addressing adverse drivers of irregular migration and promoting sustainable reintegration, including through community-based approaches. Support will be provided to Member States in developing safe and regular pathways for migration. Efforts to address irregular migration, exploitation and modern slavery - through counter-smuggling and counter-trafficking interventions in partnership with Member States and through regional cooperation - will also be key.\n\nIOM will address the health needs of migrants and mitigate their vulnerabilities during all phases of migration. IOM will protect migrants' right to health during emergencies and postcrisis and enhance inclusion of migrants in national health strategies, outbreak preparedness and response plans and universal health coverage. The current COVID-19 pandemic underlines the importance of including migrants in universal health coverage to ensure that no one is left behind and because their exclusion might increase the risk of transmission in broader communities.\n\nIOM will provide gender-sensitive, rapid effective humanitarian responses while furthering the humanitarian-development-peace nexus (HDPN), most immediately by expanding its transition and recovery portfolio. Recognizing the significant influence of climate change and environmental degradation as drivers of forced migration, and the impact of migration on the environment, IOM will expand evidence, policy and programming, leveraging partnerships to develop sustainable solutions.\n\nIOM will support governments to uphold the humanitarian principles of migration, as articulated in the African Union's Revised Migration Policy Framework for Africa, and promote regular migration for refugees and migrants through resettlement, family reunification and AVRR, as appropriate. Other pathways could include work, study and residence permits. As part of its commitment to Member States to support regular and safe migration, IOM will seek to expand its health assistance to migrants and refugees through pre-embarkation and pre-departure medical screening to ensure that migrants, including migrant workers, are fit to travel.\n\nFor more information about the RDH strategy, visit https://ronairobi.iom.int/regional-data-hub-rdh. 5\n\n5 2. POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL OUTLOOK FOR THE REGION 2.1. CONTINENTAL AND REGIONAL FRAMEWORKS AND INITIATIVES\n\nAgenda 2063 sets out seven aspirations6 to which achieving integration of the RECs; the free movement of people, goods, and services; transport and trade facilitation; and the development potential of migration are central. Numerous continental and regional frameworks and protocols push this agenda. The African Union has initiated several flagship projects at the continental level that are highly relevant for mobility and migration, such as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA),7 the African Passport and Free Movement of People,8 and the Single African Air Transport Market,9 as well as the \"Silencing the Guns in Africa\" theme for 2020.10 The Migration Policy Framework for Africa and Plan of Action (2018-2030) emphasizes the linkages between migration and development, including by recognizing the importance of the diaspora to the continent's development, in line with the Agenda 2063. The African Union's Three-Year Implementation Plan of Action for the Global Compact for Migration in Africa (2020-2022) further signals the continent's commitment to safe, orderly and regular migration. With regard to the mobility aspects of crisis and humanitarian response, the African Union adopted the Kampala Convention in 2009,11 which emphasizes the role of States in supporting and protecting internally displaced persons (IDPs) and links internal displacement, harmful practices, conflict, human rights violations and unintended consequences of development projects. The African Union also developed a Humanitarian Policy Framework in 2015, connecting humanitarian assistance, peace and security, natural and human-induced disasters, and development issues. Furthermore, African governments, at the Seventh Session of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment in 2019, agreed to align climate and environment action with Africa's socioeconomic development priorities.\n\nAt the regional level, IGAD, the EAC and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) promote migration frameworks and protocols. The EAC has developed a framework and protocol related to the free movement of labour, which includes the issuance of EAC passports by its Member States to their nationals. The IGAD Regional Migration Policy Framework (RMPF) promotes the free movement of people and the establishment of residence for nationals within the IGAD region. This is further supported by its Protocol on the Free Movement of Persons and its Protocol on Transhumance. COMESA has adopted a visa regime and an Action Plan on Migration through its own Protocol on the Free Movement of Persons, Labour, Services, Rights of Establishment and Residence to accelerate economic\n\nThe seven aspirations of the African Union are: (a) a prosperous Africa based on inclusive growth and sustainable development; (b) an integrated continent, politically united and based on the ideals of pan-Africanism and the vision of an African Renaissance; (c) an Africa of good governance, democracy, respect for human rights, justice and the rule of law; (d) a peaceful and secure Africa; (e) An Africa with a strong cultural identity, common heritage, shared values and ethics; (f) an Africa whose development is people-driven, relying on the potential of the African people, especially its women and youth, and caring for children; and (g) an Africa that is a strong, united, resilient and influential global player and partner. 7 The AfCFTA Agreement has been ratified by five Member States in the EHoA region (Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Djibouti and Ethiopia). 8 This initiative is in line with the Protocol to the Treaty on the Establishment of the African Economic Community relating to the Free 6\n\nMovement of Persons, Right of Residence and Right of Establishment. 9 In the EHoA region, the Single African Air Transport Market has been ratified by Ethiopia. 10 \"Silencing the Guns in Africa\" is a flagship initiative to create conducive conditions for Africa's development by \"ending all wars, civil conflicts, gender-based violence, violent conflicts and preventing genocide on the continent by 2020.\" (African Union, Silencing the Guns - About section. Available at https://au.int/en/flagships/silencing-guns-2020.) 11 Formally, the African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa. The full text of the Convention is available at https://au.int/en/treaties/african-union-convention-protection-and-assistance-internally-displaced-persons-africa. integration and achieve a common market. Cross-regional collaboration at the REC level, such as the tripartite agreement between COMESA, the EAC and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) (2012), also contributes to regional integration. The region is also host to several inter-State consultation mechanisms on migration (ISCMs), to which IOM is an observer, supports the secretariats of and/or provides the secretariat to.12\n\n2.2. KEY DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES IN THE REGION\n\nThrough an analysis of Member States' national development plans, as well as similar planning documents from the African Union and RECs, the following strategic priorities of Member States and regional bodies are identified:13\n\n(a) Transformative inclusive economic growth, including access to jobs, urbanization, and women and youth empowerment;\n\n(b) Regional integration;\n\n(c) Governance, conflict prevention, peace and security, and rule of law;\n\n(d) Crisis preparedness and response, resilience, climate change, and natural resource management;\n\n(e) Human development, social inclusion and social services, including health and education.\n\nSeveral cross-cutting priorities, such as gender, human rights and data, are also identified. IOM will leverage its mandate on migration towards specific strategic objectives contributing towards these priorities of its Member States in the region.\n\n2.3. CURRENT AND FUTURE KEY PARTNERS\n\nIOM will engage with and leverage key partners from Member States, RECs, the United Nations, international and regional financial institutions, and existing networks to achieve its regional strategy. As a member of the United Nations Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG), IOM will support its Member States in pursuit of the 2030 Agenda, in particular through the United Nations Country Teams (UNCTs) and UNSDCFs in the region, and by contributing to regional dialogues on migration and sustainable development. The United Nations Network on Migration for East and Southern Africa, and those gradually being rolled out at the country level, will be instrumental.14 National coordination mechanisms on migration will be key to engaging national partners and promoting a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach. Other partners will be identified from academia, civil society, migrants and the diaspora, philanthropic actors, and the private sector, including through engagement with the Knowledge Portal and Connection Hub of the United Nations Network on Migration. IOM will facilitate fora, events and opportunities to create meaningful\n\nThese include the Migration Dialogue for IGAD Region (MID-IGAD); African Union-Horn of Africa Initiative on Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling (AU-HoAI); the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States-European Union Dialogue on Migration (ACP-EU MD); and the Pan-African Forum on Migration (PAFOM). IOM is further engaged with the Migration Dialogue for COMESA (MIDCOM), the Arab Regional Consultative Process on Migration, and provides secretariat services to AU-HoAI and supports the secretariats of MID-IGAD, MIDCOM and PAFOM. 13 In addition to national development plans, this analysis includes national strategic frameworks and United Nations cooperation frameworks in the region, as well as similar planning documents by the African Union and RECs. The identified strategic priorities are, however, not exhaustive or exclusive. While the aforementioned documents capture most of the same priorities and objectives identified in the mapping undertaken, other ways of clustering the priorities could be envisaged with equal importance. 14 At the time of drafting the strategy decisions to form a United Nations Network on Migration had been taken in Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya, while discussions had started in the UNCTs in Burundi and Somalia. 12 partnerships and explore joint work and programmes with development partners. By aligning its programmes more with the national development priorities of its Member States, including as articulated in UNSDCFs, humanitarian response plans (HRPs) and similar planning instruments, IOM also aims to shift towards greater multi-year, strategy-based funding from development partners.\n\nAs a member of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) and the Global Cluster Lead for Camp Coordination and Camp Management and through active participation in many other clusters, IOM will remain at the forefront of humanitarian responses and reflect its engagement in HRPs in the region. IOM will contribute to Humanitarian Country Teams and build strong partnerships with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other civil society actors. IOM, in partnership with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), will explore synergies and promote coherence in the implementation of and follow-up to the Global Compact for Migration and Global Compact on Refugees, including the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework, through the Opportunity/Issue-Based Coalition (O/IBC) on Forced Displacement and Migration of the Regional United Nations Sustainable Development Group (R-UNSDG). IOM will partner with the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) in the follow-up and review of the Global Compact for Migration at the regional level. Building on the current COVID-19 response, IOM will continue its partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other United Nations agencies while delivering on the mandate it has received from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) to assist Member States in disease surveillance at points of entry and points of control; information management; capacity-building for Member States; laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 infections; and deploying IOM medical staff to support response activities. IOM will partner with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) within the strategic framework of the United Nations Secretary-General on the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19, particularly on migration-related issues.\n\nThe Regional Migrant Response Plan (MRP) for the Horn of Africa and Yemen will remain the key IOM platform for engaging partners in response to the challenges of mixed migration at the regional level. The MRP is a migrant-focused strategy for vulnerable migrants that comprise of initiatives ranging from urgent humanitarian interventions to medium- and long-term actions aimed at addressing the drivers of migration, building local capacities for better migration management and providing sustainable socioeconomic infrastructure to support communities of origin, transit and destination. While overall implementation is led by governments and supported by the United Nations, NGOs and other partners, IOM leads the coordination efforts for the implementation of the plan, including information management, monitoring and reporting at the regional and country levels.\n\n9 3. MIGRATION OUTLOOK FOR THE REGION 3.1. KEY MIGRATION AND POLICY TRENDS IN THE REGION The EHoA region remains highly mobile. In 2019, the RDH15 recorded almost 750,000 movements at flow monitoring points in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia and Yemen - with these movements coursing through the main migration routes of this region. The drivers were varied. Of the total, 58 per cent were motivated by economic reasons, 12 per cent by seasonal factors (seasonal work and transhumance), 11 per cent by conflict-related issues and 6 per cent by natural hazard-induced disasters, while 5 per cent were short-term movements. Socioeconomic drivers include vast economic disparities within countries (with some remote regions experiencing historic marginalization and a lack of basic services) and between regions, in particular the Horn of Africa and Gulf States. The region has a large population of youth who are either unemployed or underemployed, often in very precarious working conditions. Without a significant jump in the labour market to create opportunities to match this population, many resort to searching for opportunities elsewhere, either within the region or further afield. Most migration was observed along the Eastern route16 (63%), followed by the Horn of Africa route17 (33%), the Northern route18 (2%) and the Southern route19 (2%). The Southern Route is believed to be, in reality, significantly more travelled than the figures suggest, but due to limited data capacity along this route, movements are largely unmonitored.\n\nIOM recognizes that a person's sex and gender shape every stage of the migration experience, whether forced, voluntary or somewhere in between. Migration from Africa has historically been a male-dominated phenomenon, but the pattern has changed significantly in recent decades, with African women leaving their countries of birth to create new lives elsewhere. Gender influences reasons for migrating, who migrates and to where, how people migrate and the networks they use, opportunities and resources available at destination, and relations with the country of origin. Risks, vulnerabilities and needs are also shaped in large part by gender, often varying drastically for different groups. In 2019, of all movements tracked through the flow monitoring network established in the Yemen and Horn of Africa region, 58 per cent were adult males, 24 per cent were adult females and 18 per cent were children.20 Research shows that women are more likely to use legal channels for migration to the Arabian Peninsula - the main corridor from the region - thus often having relatively easier journeys and that they tend to find employment in Saudi Arabia more easily than men. At the same time, a growing body of literature documents the exploitation that female domestic workers face in the Middle East.21\n\nIOM, A Region on the Move: 2019 Mobility Overview in the East and Horn of Africa and the Arab Peninsula (Nairobi, 2020). Available at https:// ronairobi.iom.int/sites/default/files/document/publications/IOM_RoMR_2019.pdf. 15\n\nThe Regional Data Hub is available at https://ronairobi.iom.int/regional-data-hub-rdh. 16 The Eastern route encompasses migratory movements towards Saudi Arabia and other countries on the Arabian Peninsula. 17 The Horn of Africa route concentrates on movements towards and within the Horn of Africa, namely, Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Eritrea. 18 The Northern route refers to migration towards the northern part of the continent and possibly further, to Europe. 19 The Southern route includes migration towards countries located in the southern part of the continent, including Kenya, the United Republic of Tanzania and further, towards South Africa. 20 IOM, A Region on the Move (see footnote 15). 21 IOM, The Desire to Thrive Regardless of the Risk: Risk Perception, Expectations and Migration Experiences of Young Ethiopians Migrating Along the Eastern Route towards the Arabian Peninsula (Nairobi, 2020), available at: https://ronairobi.iom.int/sites/default/files/document/publications/ IOM%20RDH%20Eastern%20Route%20Research_Background%20Analysis_Obock%20Djibouti.pdf; Meaza Ayalew, Geremew Aklessa and Nikrote Laiboni, Women's labour migration on the African-Middle East Corridor: experiences of migrant domestic workers from Ethiopia (Addis Ababa, Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women (GAATW)), available at www.gaatw.org/pubblications/Ethiopia _Country_Report.pdf.\n\nGlobal and regional megatrends that will influence migration patterns in the coming five years include domestic and international inequalities; urbanization; digitalization, automation and innovations in information and communications and \"distance-shrinking\" technologies; demographic transition (with an increasing young population and more women entering the workforce), including the feminization of migration; and climate change alongside natural hazard-induced disasters and environmental degradation. An understanding of the dynamics of these megatrends and their implications, as well as pertinent data, will be critical for future migration management and governance in the region. Beyond these, specific drivers of migration and determinants of the Organization's work are likely to include: (a) the promise of peace and regional integration; (b) the increasingly protracted nature of crises, fragility and potential ruptures; (c) the increasingly entrenched nature of transnational organized crime; (d) the persistent vulnerability of migrants in irregular situations; and (e) the continuous re-emergence of epidemics, pandemics, zoonotic diseases and other public health threats.\n\n3.1.1. The promise of peace and regional integration\n\nAs set out above, and in line with the IOM Continental Strategy for Africa, which seeks to support inclusive and sustainable socioeconomic development, there is a growing call for regional integration and free movement of persons, goods and services in the region and on the entire continent. The current COVID-19 pandemic is pushing Member States to close their borders and restrict mobility, thus limiting migration as a livelihood option for thousands of people and narrowing its potential as an engine for socioeconomic growth. These restrictions could, over time, come to undermine free movement protocols in the region and potentially reverse earlier gains.\n\nFollowing years of conflict in the region, there have been promising developments towards peace. As highlighted in the Comprehensive Regional Prevention Strategy for the Horn of Africa, this is most markedly signified by the 2018 Peace Agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea. This rapprochement provides a basis for inclusive and economic growth and holds the potential for greater regional integration. The formation of a Transitional Government of National Unity in South Sudan marks the end of war and a new dawn, and despite recurring attacks and protracted fragility, the situation in Somalia has been moving intermittently towards a more peaceful context.\n\n3.1.2. Increasingly protracted crises, fragility and potential ruptures By the end of 2019, the East and Horn of Africa hosted an estimated 6.3 million IDPs and 3.5 million refugees and asylum seekers. Most countries in the region remain chronically affected by natural hazard-induced disasters and protracted conflict, creating new waves of forced displacement and exacerbating existing humanitarian needs. Climate change and environmental degradation are growing drivers of forced migration: new displacement in 2019 was largely triggered by hydrometeorological hazards. These included a prolonged, severe drought in the Horn of Africa region, and devastating floods following unprecedented heavy rains, which also favoured a locust invasion across East Africa. The situation is compounded by conflict-driven displacement fuelled by persistent instability and insecurity in Somalia and South Sudan, while intercommunity clashes linked to ethnic tensions and cattle-raiding were particularly prominent in Ethiopia and South Sudan. In addition, violent extremism has been playing a critical destabilizing role in some countries in the region, undermining access to humanitarian assistance and development efforts, fuelling conflict and exploiting the economic impacts of various crises to increase recruitment, especially among youth. Malnutrition, severe respiratory tract infections, and waterborne diseases, including cholera and acute watery diarrhea, have been reported among migrants and displaced populations in fragile countries. Meanwhile, health crises continued in the region, with the Ebola outbreak declared by the WHO as a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" in July 2019, eventually remaining contained within the border of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Later, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant closure of borders and adoption of other containment measures for public health.22 The latter crisis - global in nature - has significantly impacted the central functioning of societies across the world. While it is clear that the socioeconomic impacts will be far reaching, its longer-term impacts on migration patterns and mobility regimes, as well as the operating conditions of IOM, are yet to be fully understood.23\n\nThe nature and scale of forced displacement in the region present humanitarian and development challenges, requiring concerted action by the international community. Addressing the root causes of crises and associated population movements needs to be part of longer-term approaches towards recovery, transition and sustainable development. The international community should respond to crises with the understanding that migration is an inevitable consequence, and that recovery and transition efforts require consideration of the needs of migrants and their communities. These include the specific needs of women and girls, including obstacles to sexual and reproductive health before, during and after humanitarian crises. IOM also recognizes that gender-based violence, trafficking and prostitution, and forced pregnancies and marriages are critical issues to be addressed in this context.\n\nSupport to governments will be necessary, including to increase their climate change adaptation and mitigation commitments, particularly in relation to the needs of migrant and other vulnerable populations.\n\n3.1.3. Increasingly entrenched transnational organized crime\n\nThe greater Horn of Africa region is emerging as one of the most dynamic on the continent in terms of human mobility, making it an easy target for transnational organized crimes involved in human smuggling, trafficking, illicit money transfers and violent extremism. The smuggling and trafficking of migrants across international borders is expanding from the region towards the Middle East, Northern Africa and Europe.24\n\nMigrant smuggling in the region is caused by factors such as growing economic disparities, greater opportunities for employment abroad, increased barriers for regular migration, lack of awareness about the risks of irregular migration and alternative pathways, and technological advances in transportation and communication, with climate change as a threat multiplier. Smuggling and trafficking are associated with the generally porous national borders in the region and contribute to an erosion of rule of law, corruption and violations of the human rights of migrants.\n\nInsufficient information-sharing, especially between institutions working on air, maritime and land borders, as well as inadequate use of data and institutional capacities to monitor the movements of people, hinder Member States, RECs and the African Union to respond effectively.\n\nIOM, A Region on the Move (see footnote 20). 23 United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), Covid-19 in Africa: Protecting Lives and Economies (Addis Ababa, 2020).

Persistent vulnerability of migrants in irregular situations\n\nInterregional inequalities, particularly between the Horn of Africa and the Gulf region along the Eastern route, but also further afield vis-à-vis Europe in the north and South Africa in the south, motivate people to migrate irregularly out of the region, mainly to look for better economic opportunities. This irregularity increases migrants' risk of becoming victims of trafficking and other forms of violence, exploitation, and abuse, including sexual and genderbased violence, before departure, in transit, on arrival and on return to the place of origin. Journeys also involve exposure to dehydration, starvation, and, when travelling by sea, the dangers of forced disembarkation while in deep-sea areas and the capsizing of overcrowded boats.25 On arrival at their destinations, migrants (especially women and children) risk being abducted by gangs and traffickers, demonstrating that smugglers and traffickers often work together.26 The region experiences steady numbers of returns from abroad, many of which are involuntary in nature. In 2019, 120,825 Ethiopian nationals and more than 5,000 Somali nationals were returned from Saudi Arabia alone.27 With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated closure of borders, thousands of migrants have been stranded in the region, particularly in Djibouti and Somalia, along the Eastern route. Meanwhile, uncoordinated returns have presented challenges to ensuring that appropriate public health measures are in place for migrants and the communities that receive them. Furthermore, the crisis has exacerbated the xenophobic and discriminatory treatment of migrants, with ramifications far beyond the region.\n\n3.1.5. The continuous re-emergence of epidemics, pandemics, zoonotic diseases and other public health threats\n\nCOVID-19 is a reminder of the devastating public health impacts of the continuous reemergence of epidemics and pandemics, as well as the alarming and growing trend in zoonotic diseases.28 Livestock has been found to act as a bridge between diseases in wildlife and diseases in humans, and as climate change and environmental degradation force growing populations to encroach further into natural habitats, the risk of transmission through the human, animal and environment interface is very real.29 One key population at risk in the EHoA region are pastoralists.30 The COVID-19 crisis highlights the importance of preparing for future pandemics, and that the migration-climate change-health nexus must be urgently prioritized, with a focus on prevention and preparedness. Climate change and its multiplier impact on environmental degradation is expected to result in a higher frequency of climate-related health hazards and fatalities due to malnutrition, increased propagation of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue, and heat stress, among others. At any rate, many migrants moving in contexts of climate change, environmental degradation and natural disasters often experience significant barriers to accessing essential health and social services.31\n\nIOM, Fatal Journeys: Tracking Lives Lost During Migration (Geneva, 2014).

REGIONAL STRATEGIC PRIORITIES AND AREAS OF EXPANSION FOR THE WORK OF IOM\n\nIn response to the trends and to the development priorities of its Member States, the African Union and RECs, along with international and regional frameworks, IOM has identified seven regional strategic objectives.32 These strategic objectives have been clustered under, and respond to, the three pillars of the IOM Strategic Vision - resilience, mobility and governance - as set out in this section.\n\n4.1. RESILIENCE\n\nIn response to the promise of peace; the increasingly protracted nature of crises, fragility and potential ruptures; persistent vulnerability of migrants in irregular situations; and the continuous re-emergence of epidemics, pandemics, zoonotic diseases and other public health threats, IOM will redouble its humanitarian response and efforts geared towards resilience. In doing so, IOM will engage across the HDPN \"contiguum\".33 This will include, among others, early warning and prevention; crisis preparedness and response, including for disease outbreaks; protection measures along migratory routes; community-based interventions to address adverse drivers of displacement and irregular migration; and transition and recovery programming, in line with its Migration Crisis Operational Framework.\n\n4.1.1. Priority 1: Mitigate adverse drivers of displacement and irregular migration\n\nNoting the role of domestic inequalities, including in the access to basic services and decent work, as well as climate change as key drivers of internal migration, IOM will significantly increase efforts to address adverse drivers of irregular migration, especially through area-based community development approaches to reintegration, and adverse drivers in areas with high outward migration. It will do so in a manner that builds social cohesion between migrants and host communities and promotes trust, especially in fragile and post-conflict contexts, for example, by supporting local authorities to develop community action plans collaboratively with community members, including IDPs and returnees, thus outlining inclusive common visions and priorities for peaceful coexistence and sustainable development. IOM will also explore employment-based solutions in areas with high outward migration, benefiting all those in the community, not just migrants, including through public- private partnerships, and in cooperation with multilateral development banks (MDBs) and other United Nations partners to invest in job creation, continuous skills development and training. This will ultimately support Member States' priority to ensure human development and social services, as well as transformative inclusive economic growth.\n\nThese strategic objectives respond to the pillars described in the IOM Strategic Vision. The IOM Strategic Results Framework (SRF) and its four objectives: humanitarian response (SRF Objective 1), resilience (Objective 2), mobility (Objective 3) and governance (Objective 4) capture the areas highlighted in the Strategic Vision. The strategic objectives in this strategy will be tackled through coordinated cross-thematic approaches to contribute to broader regional goals. 33 HDPN practitioners tend to speak of a \"contiguum\" to indicate that the process is not linear - i.e. starting with humanitarian response, followed by development and then by peace. Rather, there are overlapping simultaneous and reinforcing efforts, which can be described as contiguous and, thus, the term \"contiguum\". 32\n\nReducing conflict- and climate-induced displacement, particularly protracted displacement, is critical for the EHoA region. This may call for a new approach to disaster risk reduction (DRR) beyond short-term interventions, with attention to governance and the mainstreaming of migration into DRR strategies at the community, national and regional levels. A DRR roadmap for engagement in the region would provide IOM country offices with further guidance in their programming, as well as promote linkages to migration, environment and climate change (MECC) interventions.\n\nTo enhance resilience, respond to climate change and promote natural resource management, IOM will focus on expanding the evidence-base through research on climate and environmental migration trends, including through its RDH; supporting legislators and decision makers on policy and planning; and providing technical support and mainstreaming of MECC in its programmes, with an emphasis on mitigation. This will help support predictions and build the capacity of its Member States to prepare for higher numbers of people moving in and out of situations of vulnerability stemming from a range of complex drivers. The Organization will invest in understanding how environmental degradation and climate change impact on and interact with instability, inequality and other drivers of migration, such as transhumance. Emerging health challenges related to climate change and environmental degradation, such as the zoonosis trend, will be explored, with a focus on prevention and preparedness. IOM support will be focussed on the most vulnerable populations, to address the adverse effects of both rapid and slow onset of climate impacts, while pursuing longer-term, sustainable adaptation solutions.\n\nIOM will support Member States in mainstreaming migration in key environmental and climate change policies and plans; including related considerations in migration policies and legislation; and preparing for, and follow-up to, global processes, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties and the implementation of the Global Compact for Migration objectives on adverse drivers (Objective 2) and on pathways for regular migration (Objective 5). IOM will adopt a more proactive, strategic and coordinated approach to MECC policy and programming, pursuing emerging issues, technological innovations, as well as joint interventions with both new and existing partners, such as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), UN-Habitat, the EAC, and IGAD and its institutions, such as the IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) and the IGAD Centre for Pastoral Areas and Livestock Development (ICPALD), as well as the private sector.\n\n4.1.2. Priority 2: Promote and provide timely and effective assistance and protection to people at risk and/or affected by crisis\n\nIOM will support crisis preparedness and continue to provide rapid effective humanitarian responses according to humanitarian principles and gender considerations. This will include improving its understanding of how gender affects people's experiences of the crisis and how crises change gender roles and relations; addressing gender-specific protection and assistance needs; preventing and responding to the emergence of new forms of genderbased violence; and building on gender-specific capacities to respond to crises. IOM will support Member States and RECs to save and protect lives and reduce morbidity in complex emergencies and natural disasters.\n\nIn response to the continuous re-emergence of epidemics, pandemics, zoonotic diseases and other public health threats, IOM will build on the Ebola outbreak and COVID-19 experience to enhance its support to Member States in the areas of health resilience and outbreak preparedness, surveillance, detection and response. Through its lead role at points of entry and land border crossings, IOM, in coordination with the WHO Regional Office for Africa and the Africa CDC, will assist Member States in strengthening the International Health Regulations core capacity. IOM will provide direct service delivery, particularly primary health care and associated mental health and psychosocial support, to vulnerable migrants, host populations and government capacities, through the deployment of staff and rapid response teams, as well as its laboratories and health clinics. IOM will continue its paramount programme of migration health assessment through its network of health assessment centres and laboratories across the region, contributing in assisting migrants and refugees in healthy, safe and orderly migration through pre-embarkation and pre-departure medical screening and health education, to ensure that they are fit to travel. Such support will be provided within humanitarian and development contexts to ensure that migrants and IDPs are not left behind.\n\nIn response to the persistent vulnerability of migrants in irregular situations, IOM will advance an approach to migration, protection and assistance built upon principles espoused by its Handbook on Protection and Assistance for Migrants Vulnerable to Violence, Exploitation, and Abuse.34 IOM will promote sustainable reintegration approaches, in line with its forthcoming policy on return and reintegration, including by supporting governments towards progressively taking ownership of the return and reintegration process, and by building on the integrated reintegration approach developed under the European Union- IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Reintegration and Protection. IOM will assist Member States in advancing alternatives to detention in the EHoA region, in line with Objective 13 of the Global Compact for Migration, and step up efforts to address the negative perceptions of migrants, as per Objective 17 of the Global Compact. Promotion of child protection and an end to child detention in key regional frameworks will be crucial to addressing children's specific vulnerabilities during the migration cycle. The IOM Determinants of Migrant Vulnerability tool will be a key instrument in identifying needs of migrant adults and children of all genders and to analyse factors that contribute to their vulnerability and resilience. The tool further informs programming geared towards mitigating vulnerability, reducing harm and informing comprehensive and sustainable solutions. Efforts will also be made to support governments to enhance consular protection and cooperation to assist migrants in vulnerable situations outside the region, in line with Objective 14 of the Global Compact for Migration and as espoused in the Regional Ministerial Forum on Migration (RMFM).35\n\nIncreased attention will be placed on the Southern route, which has gained less attention than the Eastern route towards the Arabian Peninsula and the Northern route towards Europe. IOM will consolidate and upgrade its network of Migrant Response Centres (MRCs) and pursue equitable and comprehensive responses along all regional routes. The collection and use of reliable migration health data, along with migration variables that systematically integrates, analyses and monitors health information data, will be supported in countries in the region.\n\nIOM, Handbook on Protection and Assistance for Migrants Vulnerable to Violence, Exploitation, and Abuse (Geneva, 2019). Available at https:// publications.iom.int/books/iom-handbook-migrants-vulnerable-violence-exploitation-and-abuse. 35 As set out in the Communiqué from the Regional Ministerial Forum on Harmonising Labour Migration Policies in East and Horn of Africa: A United Approach on Safe, Regular and Humane Labour Migration (21 January 2020), the RMFM sets out priority actions for interState collaboration on diplomatic and consular assistance for migrant workers, in particular, where some States don't have diplomatic representation. 34\n\n4.1.3. Priority 3: Promote durable solutions and reintegration for displaced persons and returning migrants\n\nIn support of improved governance, peace and security, and rule of law, IOM will engage in traditional peacebuilding measures, as well as disarmament, demobilization, reintegration (DDR) prevention of violent extremism (PVE) and community stabilization. By enhancing social cohesion, trust and stability in high-risk and unpredictable environments, while at the same time addressing longer-term impacts and drivers of vulnerability, these efforts will contribute to conditions that are more conducive to a resolution of the crisis, and to longer-term development efforts in line with the recommendation by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for the HDPN.36 As such, IOM will prioritize prevention and protection from further displacement, as well as durable solutions to protracted crisis and displacement under the New Way of Working.37 Development efforts will be pursued through partnerships with MDBs such as the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the World Bank. By targeting youth, many of these initiatives serve the objective of youth empowerment. IOM will develop a regional peacebuilding approach to strengthen its operationalization of the HDPN. Noting the importance of an accountable and effective security sector for ending protracted crises and promoting durable solutions to displacement, IOM could expand its support to peacebuilding processes through security sector reform programming. Environmental governance and natural resource management are other areas of programming that provide opportunities to enhance peacebuilding.\n\n4.2. MOBILITY\n\nSupport for regional integration and to facilitate mobility more broadly are the most immediate ways that an organization like IOM, with migration at the core of its mandate, can contribute to national and regional objectives of transformative inclusive economic growth and youth and women empowerment. IOM will make efforts to mainstream migration into development planning and empower migrants to contribute to sustainable development. This will be particularly important in view of the need to support Member States and migrants to address the socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19.\n\n4.2.1. Priority 4: Facilitate mobility and support regional integration\n\nTo promote the potential of regional integration, IOM will support the mobility dimension of these efforts of Member States, as well as those of the African Union's and RECs'. Regional cooperation on free movement remains a challenge due to the inadequate capacities and resources of Member States, as well as conflicting political agendas and priorities. The COVID-19-related mobility restrictions have exacerbated this situation. Opportunities therefore exist for IOM to work with the African Union, RECs and Member States in the region to ensure that the momentum for, and commitment to, regional free movement of persons protocols remain; further include migration in their protocols and frameworks; support Member States to operationalize relevant free movement protocols; and enhance the capacity of Member States to develop and implement relevant migration policies and frameworks.\n\nOECD, Development Assistance Committee Recommendation on the Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus (OECD/LEGAL/5019) (Paris, 2020). Available at https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/public/doc/643/643.en.pdf. 37 A central component of the New Way of Working is the adoption of joint approaches (assessments, analysis, planning, programming and/ or financing) towards so-called collective outcomes, as a transformative tool to bring humanitarian, development and peace actors together around the same priorities and objectives that can reduce need, risk and vulnerability with a view to accelerating progress towards the SDGs. 36\n\nIn the EHoA region, IOM is well-positioned to support Member States on issues of migration governance and regional integration through the Joint Labour Migration Priority Programme (JLMP), as well as through its support for Member States' migration management capacities under the Better Migration Management Programme and the African Regional Migration Programme, especially through increasing its policy support and capacity enhancement in the realm of migration. Partnerships will be deepened with the African Union and RECs, as well as the International Labour Organization (ILO), one of the existing partners of the JLMP. Through the JLMP, the RMFM38 and other existing initiatives, IOM will engage Member States to develop appropriate and responsive labour migration policies and strengthen data collection by identifying opportunities to use administrative data and new data resources, analysis and dissemination within the region in order to promote inter-State and inter-REC coordination. The African Capacity Building Centre (ACBC) will expand its capacity-building support beyond immigration and border management into more comprehensive migration management support to RECs and Member States, including on data.\n\nTo facilitate mobility, IOM will also enhance its immigration and border management support to Member States and RECs, particularly for the establishment of and capacity enhancement in increasing number of so-called \"One-Stop Border Posts\" and through support for the streamlining of processes, management of information and institutional capacity to effectively and efficiently manage borders. The current work with TradeMark East Africa (TMEA) is an important partnership in this regard. IOM will engage its Member States and other partners in facilitating movements and trade along maritime routes. IOM will further explore ways to support and expand such support to the field of identity management, including by realizing the full potential of digital registration and identification - whether to facilitate pathways for regular migration and mobility, manage borders or support migrants' access to services.\n\n4.2.2. Priority 5: Promote inclusion and conditions that empower migrants and the diaspora to contribute to sustainable development\n\nIOM will empower migrants and the diaspora as agents of transformative and inclusive economic growth, including by supporting the temporary return of qualified nationals, with a view to filling critical skills gaps in key sectors of Member States' economies (e.g. health and education) and engaging them either remotely or for private sector development, investment and promotion of innovation and trade. To empower women, IOM will strive to understand how gender interacts with migration and to respond accordingly, including through gender mainstreaming of labour migration frameworks, in an effort to address the specific needs and capacities of all, as opposed to perpetuating inequality. Through its work, IOM will advocate for equal rights under the law in employment and mobility; combat discriminatory migration practices; respond to gender-based or -related determinants of access to social services, economic growth, capacities and skills, risks and vulnerabilities; ensure diversity and inclusiveness in consultations and participation in activities; and address how migration influences gender roles and relations.\n\nAs set out in the Communiqué from the Regional Ministerial Forum on Harmonising Labour Migration Policies in East and Horn of Africa: A United Approach on Safe, Regular and Humane Labour Migration (21 January 2020), the RMFM sets out priority actions for effective labour migration policy development and drafting, negotiating and implementing bilateral labour migration agreements. 38\n\nTo promote human development and access to social services, IOM will promote decent working conditions for migrant workers and the protection of migrant workers' rights, working closely with government and non-government stakeholders, including in partnership with the ILO. This will include the promotion of ethical recruitment; efforts to address barriers to accessing job markets, especially for female migrant workers; mutual recognition of qualifications, capacities and skills between countries; and inclusion in and portability of earned social security benefits. Regional integration, bilateral labour migration agreements and regional cooperation to promote collective bargaining vis-à-vis other regions and third countries are critical vehicles for this. Support will be provided to strengthen regulatory frameworks for ethical and fair recruitment, and to enhance the capacity of governments and recruitment agents for the same. IOM will also expand its migration health assessments to migrant workers. IOM will promote the sexual and reproductive health and rights of migrants and assist Member States in strengthening public health programmes to reduce health inequality, including through the progressive inclusion of migrants in universal health coverage as an essential component of regional integration. Access to social protection and health financing for migrants, as well as support to Members States to retain their health workforce, will also be supported. IOM will strengthen its primary health-care services and its non-discriminatory health service delivery to complement government efforts to address the health needs of migrants and host communities.\n\n4.3. GOVERNANCE Effective governance is a key priority of many Member States in the region. As recognized in the 2030 Agenda, well-planned and managed migration policies are key to ensuring safe, orderly and regular migration. IOM will therefore prioritize efforts to support Member States capacities in the governance of migration.\n\n4.3.1. Priority 6: Promote robust and whole-of-government structures, coherent policies and normative frameworks underpinning migration at the subnational, national, regional and global levels and supportive of sustainable development objectives\n\nIOM will provide more effective policy support to Member States to pursue a wholeof-government, whole-of-society approach and ensure policy coherence with broader sustainable development strategies. To this effect, IOM will support the implementation and follow-up of the commitments made by Member States within the Global Compact for Migration, including through the United Nations Network on Migration.\n\nTo facilitate the management and coordination of migration governance across governmental bodies, IOM will cooperate with IGAD, the EAC, COMESA, ISCMs in the region, and individual Member States, including their national statistics agencies in the particular, in the production, harmonization and comparability of migration data; data collection and management; use of data towards policy, establishment of functioning national migration data governance frameworks and data-sharing protocols across agencies; and in helping report on international commitments. IOM will provide tailored capacity-building activities to Member States, as well as technical support to enhance the information management capacity of governmental counterparts involved in the provision of assistance to returning migrants. In view of the current COVID-19 pandemic, IOM will expand its interventions and partnerships for capacity enhancement in the areas of migration health, migration health policy actions and diplomacy for governments and United Nations agencies, academia, NGOs, migrant civil society and other stakeholders.\n\nRecognizing that there has been rapid urbanization within the EHoA region, and that over half of Africans are expected to live in cities by 2050, IOM will support city administrations and local authorities to engage in migration dialogues at the global, continental, regional, national and subnational levels. IOM will support the mainstreaming of migration in local development planning, contribute to climate-resilient cities and urban adaptation opportunities for urban and peri-urban migrants and thus support the New Urban Agenda and SDG 11. It will do so building on its partnership with UN-Habitat and the East African Regional Dialogue on Migration and Development in Cities.39\n\n4.3.2. Priority 7: Reduce the incidence of irregular migration, including smuggling of migrants and trafficking of persons\n\nTo promote the rule of law, maintain the integrity of migration and mobility schemes, and support Member States in their efforts to address increasingly entrenched transnational organized crime, IOM will continue its counter-smuggling and counter-trafficking programming in the region. These efforts will address the issues of unregulated cross-border movements, insufficient information-sharing among border institutions and inadequate institutional capacities to monitor the movement of people and use data effectively. IOM will support integrated border management, improve transborder infrastructure and enhance the capacity of migration and border agencies to collect, analyse and use intelligence, including to address terrorism, as well as trafficking in persons, smuggling in migrants and other transborder criminal activity. IOM will promote identity management, including through civil registry and the use of alternative forms of identification and equipment, in partnership with the International Civil Aviation Organization and INTERPOL. Specific efforts will be made to enhance maritime engagement, including by exploring maritime and inland maritime obligations related to border management, and through partnerships and increased support to the Blue Economy Initiative.40\n\nThese interventions call for stronger engagement with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and departments within the African Union, the EAC and IGAD on matters pertaining to peace and security, as well as greater utilization of the African Union Boundary Information System set of tools that provide reference information about borders in Africa. The above interventions link to the PVE initiatives of IOM, as some such groups rely on smuggling, trafficking and, at times, drug-related crimes.\n\nSee: UN-Habitat, East African Regional Dialogue on Migration and Development in Cities: Summary Report (Nairobi, 2019). 40 For more information, visit www.undp.org/content/dam/kenya/docs/UNDP%20Reports/Policy%20Brief%20%202018%20-%206-%20%20 39\n\nBlue%20Economy%20for%20Inclusive%20and%20Sustainable%20Growth.pdf.\n\n5. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 5.1. OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR THE IOM REGIONAL OFFICE AND COUNTRY MISSIONS\n\nIn order to deliver on the expectations from IOM's Member States, migrants and fellow United Nations agencies, as well as on the strategic objectives set out above, IOM in the East and Horn of Africa will increase its institutional capacities in several ways. Priorities include improving its policy capacity and regional cooperation; innovation, institutional learning and knowledge management, including data collection, management, dissemination and use, research production, and monitoring and evaluation; communications and visibility; and staff development as set out below.\n\n5.2. POLICY CAPACITY AND REGIONAL COOPERATION\n\nIOM will enhance its policy support capacity within the regional office and at the country level, including through the ACBC, to effectively support Member States in the region in the development of appropriate and responsive national migration and regional policies and legislative frameworks for effective migration governance and comprehensive management of migration issues, including displacement and durable solutions. Programmes will be designed more purposefully to support the national development plans of Member States, as well as related frameworks at the regional or continental level, in partnership with the African Union and RECs. The Migration Governance Indicators will be used to establish a baseline of existing legislation and policies in, and to inform policy support for Member States. Regional programmes will be leveraged to complement policy capacities of country offices. IOM will leverage its role as secretariat and coordinator of the United Nations Network on Migration to enhance its capacity to provide policy support, including by ensuring whole-ofthe-United Nations support for the implementation and follow-up to the Global Compact for Migration and the 2030 Agenda.\n\n5.3. INNOVATION, INSTITUTIONAL LEARNING, KNOWLEDGE\n\nMANAGEMENT, INCLUDING DATA COLLECTION AND DISSEMINATION, RESEARCH PRODUCTION, AND MONITORING AND EVALUATION\n\nThrough the development of a culture of innovation, learning and sharing, accompanied by appropriate systems and tools, IOM in the East and Horn of Africa will facilitate a knowledge management approach that harnesses expertise within the region and identifies new areas for learning. Cross-thematic approaches will be encouraged to promote learning across programmatic areas.\n\nPolicy and programmatic advances will be pursued in areas where consensus has been reached at the global, continental or regional level, but where there is scope for improvement in national-level implementation, such as alternatives to detention for migration offences, ending the detention of migrant children and migrants' inclusion in universal health coverage. Many of these issues have gained importance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where detention facilities are often not designed for appropriate infection prevention and control measures, and the exclusion of, for example, irregular migrants can have negative public health implications. Attention will be paid to replicable or scalable good practices, as well as bottlenecks in operationalizing policy commitments and ways to solve them.\n\nAdvances in programmatic and policy approaches in these areas will be pursued through programme design geared towards learning, targeted research and strengthened monitoring and evaluation capacities at the country level. Attention will be given to, for example, the impact of reintegration support to migrants, migrants' profiles, migration drivers, decisionmaking processes of migrants along the main migration routes of the region, and the public health impact of IOM programmes.\n\nSeveral government entities in the region have requested IOM to help strengthen their migration data capacities to be in line with regional and global initiatives. Through the RDH, IOM will strengthen the migration data capacities of various institutions to inform effective migration management and good governance with timely, quality, disaggregated and harmonized migration data.41 This will be done by supporting evidence-based, strategic and policy-level discussion on migration through a combination of data- and research-related initiatives. Through its Regional Data Warehouse, IOM will expand its capacity to carry out data-sourcing and storage; data processing for analysis; and reporting and information-sharing, with the aim to enhance the use of migration data for IOM and United Nations systemwide programming and policy advice. This will be largely achieved through the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), a system for tracking and monitoring displacement and population mobility, providing critical information to decision makers and responders during crises, and contributing to better understanding of migration flows. The DTM constitutes the largest primary data source for IOM and has large-scale operations across six countries in the EHoA region. Other IOM programming areas, such as the Missing Migrants Project, data on human trafficking, AVRR (aided by the Migrant Management Operational Systems Application (MIMOSA)) and migration health, further contribute towards this goal. Enhanced regional data dissemination and knowledge-sharing will be pursued through joint events on mixed migration with MRP partners and in partnership with academia and research organizations.\n\n5.4. COMMUNICATIONS AND VISIBILITY\n\nIOM will strengthen its institutional capacity to project its vision and work to relevant audiences through a regional communication strategy. This includes using and optimizing media and communication tools such as video, photography, audio and print, and increasing the reach of its website and new digital media forms. IOM will produce and distribute strong and impactful original content, with migrant-centred and host community human-interest stories from the field. IOM will develop and strengthen links with national, regional and international media, and with both traditional and new media, and will work with social media, influencers, and opinion-formers.\n\nThe RDH strategy is organized across four main pillars: (a) strengthening IOM primary and secondary data collection and analysis to ensure harmonization and interoperability of key methodologies used to monitor population mobility; (b) increasing information management capacity to strengthen data consolidation and quality control across various data sources; (c) conducting regional research and analysis on mixed migration topics and enhancing data dissemination and knowledge-sharing across both programmatic and policy-level stakeholders; and (d) providing technical support to key governmental stakeholders to enhance their migration data capacity as part of existing regional and global initiatives. (IOM, \"Regional Data Hub snapshot 2019\" (Nairobi, 2019). Available at https://ronairobi.iom.int/sites/default/files/document/ publications/Regional%20Data%20Hub_2019%20Snapshot_final.pdf.) 41\n\nTo enhance the capacity of its staff to be available for media interviews and effective handling of media requests, IOM will develop country communication strategies and expand and build media and communications capacities across the region. This will help IOM achieve its objectives and position the Organization with key local audiences and enablers among government, civil society, partners and the general public.\n\nIOM will initiate outreach events designed to raise IOM's visibility in the region and, by building on various data initiatives, help change negative perceptions of migration. IOM's vision is to promote a deeper understanding of its work that shows its effectiveness and positive impact on the lives of migrants and support for governments to develop approaches that promote safe, orderly and dignified migration.\n\n5.5. STAFF DEVELOPMENT\n\nIOM recognizes that successful implementation of East and Horn of Africa Regional Strategy 2020-2024 will require effective management and an enabling workplace environment based on effective staff recruitment, deployment, motivation, development, staff welfare and a safe working environment. The strategy's objectives will be included in IOM's StaffEvaluation System to enhance accountability. A self-learning attitude will be promoted42 and supported by the Regional Office by identifying free online courses. Other tools include the establishment of a regional mentorship programme, field experience and short-term assignments.\n\nWhere appropriate self-learning will be included within the StaffEvaluation System for accountability and recognition. 42\n\n6. CONCLUDING STATEMENT: IOM IN THE EAST AND HORN OF AFRICA IN 2024\n\n6. CONCLUDING STATEMENT:\n\nIOM IN THE EAST AND HORN OF AFRICA IN 2024 28\n\nIOM envisages that, by 2024, the Organization will have consolidated its role as a full and active member of the United Nations family in the East and Horn of Africa, coordinating an inclusive and whole of the United Nations support for the implementation of, and followup to, the Global Compact for Migration. IOM will have strengthened partnerships with its Member States, the African Union and RECs, as well as within the UNCTs, intergovernmental organizations, civil society and other partners in the region. IOM's policy capacity will have been enhanced and migration in all its complexities will be mainstreamed in CCAs and UNSDCFs, and in Member States' national development plans and voluntary national reviews of the SDGs. A comprehensive overview of Member States' policies on migration will have been generated and regularly updated through the Migration Governance Indicators, serving as a basis for jointly identifying priority areas of support for Member States' capacities in the area of migration management and to promote a whole-of-government approach towards achieving sustainable development outcomes for all.\n\nIOM will be carrying out its mandated role and supporting the regional reviews of the Global Compact for Migration in coordination with UNECA, the African Union and RECs. The United Nations Network on Migration at the regional and country levels will be the primary vehicle for ensuring comprehensive inter-agency inputs and mobilizing support to Member States in their implementation of their commitments to the Global Compact. IOM envisages that the joint programmes funded by the Multi-Partner Trust Fund for Migration will have been activated in the region to assist Member States.\n\nIn line with the roll-out of United Nations Reform in the region, IOM, in partnership with UNHCR, will be systematically exploring synergies and promoting coherence in the implementation of, and follow-up to, the Global Compact for Migration and the Global Compact on Refugees through the R-UNSDG O/IBC on Forced Displacement and Migration.\n\nIOM envisages that through its partnerships with its Member States, the African Union and RECs, the migration agenda will have been advanced in the region, including towards the realization of free movement of services and persons, and the right of residence and establishment. This will be complemented by IOM's support for Member State-led initiatives, such as the RMFM, and closer partnership with National Coordination Mechanisms on migration.\n\nThrough enhanced dialogue with donors in the region and particularly in capital cities, IOM will have influenced the migration agenda of both traditional and non-traditional donors, and expand its programmatic portfolio and increase funding levels, including through multiyear, strategy-based funding. This will have contributed to a more comprehensive and balanced response to migration opportunities and challenges in the region, across the three outward migration routes from the EHoA region. By aligning its programmes with national development plans, IOM envisages to be an implementing partner of several Member States in the region in the execution of initiatives funded by MDBs such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank.\n\nThrough the RDH for the EHoA region, RECs and Member States will be supported in pursuing evidence-based policies on migration. IOM and United Nations-wide programming and policy advice will be informed by the enhanced use of migration data.\n\nThroughout the region, IOM country strategies will be in place ensuring strategic programmes and a whole-of-organization approach, and effective partnerships across the HDPN contiguum, in the spirit of the New Way of Working. While IOM provides timely and effective humanitarian responses reflecting the needs of affected populations, IOM envisages that the transition and recovery portfolio will have expanded significantly. Through improved understanding of the mobility dimensions of climate change and environmental degradation, IOM will be promoting effective prevention, preparedness, mitigation and adaptation to existing and emerging issues, in partnership with relevant actors. IOM will work with regional and national legislators to enable them to reflect migration appropriately in climate change policies and plans and vice versa. This will include implementing IOM's Strategic Work Plan on Disaster Risk Reduction, in support of the United Nations Plan of Action on Disaster Risk Reduction for Resilience and the objectives of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.\n\nIOM envisages that it will lead cross-border initiatives, in partnership with UNODC, in response to transnational organized crime related to the smuggling and trafficking of persons; in partnership with UNICEF and Save the Children and other child protection actors, to enhance the protection of children on the move; and, in preparedness for and response to pandemics, as the lead actor on point/port-of-entry response to health emergencies under the overall coordination of WHO and relevant Member States.\n\nProtection of migrants in vulnerable situations will be ensured through an inclusive and geographically expanded MRP that extends to the Southern route. This response plan will be characterized by effective coordination, advocacy, information-sharing and resource mobilization, as well as full ownership by its partners at the regional, as well as country levels.\n\nIOM envisages that it will have maintained its resettlement capacities and can respond effectively to increasing demands for resettlement from the region, and that its health assessment programme has been expanded to provide services for labour migrants bound for the Gulf States.\n\nIOM envisages that, as a learning organization, it will have advanced its understanding of, and policy and implementation in, areas such as alternatives to detention, ending child detention and inclusion of migrants in universal health coverage, including as a key dimension of regional integration and mobility. In closing, IOM will be contributing to a more positive narrative of migration, with an enhanced capacity to carry out strategic communications.\n\nANNEX\n\nANNEX: IOM IN THE EAST AND HORN OF AFRICA\n\nIOM initiated operations in the East and Horn of Africa in 1984 and established its first office in Kenya in 1993. In 2020, the IOM Regional Office in Nairobi, Kenya, coordinates IOM activities in 10 countries, namely, Burundi, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. In addition to these ten country offices (with the Eritrea country office pending opening), IOM has a Special Liaison Office to the African Union and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the African Capacity Building Centre, as well as numerous sub-offices, Migrant Response Centres, including community wellness centres extending primary health-care services to migrants and their host communities, and Migration Health Assessment Centres (MHACs), as set out on the map on the next page.\n\nThe Regional Office for the East and Horn of Africa oversees, plans, coordinates and supports IOM activities within the region through its network of country offices. The Regional Office has a liaison and coordination role with the East African Community (EAC) and Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) to enhance regional cooperation and dialogue on migration and contribute to their enhanced understanding of migration issues. This relationship enables IOM to translate political decisions into practical programmatic and policy responses at the regional and national levels. It also liaises and coordinates closely with the United Nations Office in Nairobi, the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and UN-Habitat headquarters and promotes interagency cooperation on migration with regional United Nations and other key partners. It supports data-strengthening and evidence-based programming and policies through the harmonization and analysis of migration-related data through its Regional Data Hub (RDH). The Regional Office provides technical support to country offices, particularly in the area of project development, project implementation, monitoring and evaluation, resource mobilization and resource management. It implements regional programmes where there is a clear value added for a regional approach; undertakes regional public information activities to contribute to IOM's visibility and to promote its activities with counterparts and donors at the regional and global levels, and promotes knowledge-sharing and knowledge management within the region. At the thematic level, the Regional Office provides guidance and support to its country offices and other partners on emergency and humanitarian responses, including in areas of the humanitarian-development-peace nexus; migration, environment and climate change; immigration and border management; migration and health; labour migration; migration and development, including through diaspora engagement; migrant protection and assistance, including through countertrafficking and return and reintegration; and migration policy and data.\n\nThe ten country offices in the region form part of a global network of country offices and sub-offices which implement a wide range of projects along the thematic areas outlined above and thus address specific migration needs, building on the IOM's unique migration portfolio and expertise, along with its broad operational base. These country offices keep abreast of and analyse migration issues and emerging trends in their respective countries to develop appropriate responses and contribute to regional strategies and planning. Country offices are financed predominantly by projects implemented in their respective locations. Partners include migrants and communities, as well as governments at the local, national and regional levels; other United Nations entities; multilateral bodies, including regional economic communities; non-governmental, community-based and civil society organizations; the private sector; and diasporas, among others.\n\nIn recent years, IOM has become the lead convener of migration dialogue and cooperation on migration governance throughout the region. Ethiopia hosts the IOM Special Liaison Office (SLO), which maintains and strengthens IOM's relations with the African Union and the Economic Commission for Africa. The SLO works to enhance IOM's strategic engagement with both of these bodies, particularly the African Union Commission, the highest continental policy organ, by ensuring the appropriate inclusion of migration in its developmental, political, social, and peace and security policy agendas. This relationship enables IOM to translate political decisions into practical programmatic and policy responses at the regional and national levels. The SLO is accredited to and works closely with UNECA to mainstream migration into multilateral initiatives focusing on Africa. The Office works to ensure that IOM Headquarters and regional and country offices in Africa are kept abreast of key decisions and new policy directions of both bodies. The SLO also has full country office responsibilities with the host government.\n\nIOM operates Migration Health Assessment Centres (MHACs) in Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Burundi for immigrant and refugee pre-migration health assessment activities. All MHACs are fully equipped with radiology and laboratory facilities. Pre-migration health activities in Djibouti and the United Republic of Tanzania are also processed in partnership with external service providers for immigrants. IOM in the United Republic of Tanzania operates the Makere Processing Centre, which houses a complete health assessment facility, including radiology and laboratory facilities for the country's refugee resettlement programme. IOM Nairobi and Makere laboratories are categorized as biosafety level-3 laboratories and are able to perform Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture. Through these MHACs and the Makere Processing Centre, IOM is supporting COVID-19 responses across the region, including through the deployment of health professionals to government run facilities and by carrying out COVID-19 testing. These centres are also selected to support the First Line of Defence Framework for United Nations personnel and their family members, including through testing for COVID-19.\n\nIOM has supported the establishment and operation of seven Migration Response Centres (MRCs)43 in the Horn of Africa: Hargeisa and Bossaso in Somalia (2009), Obock in Djibouti (2011), and Semera and Metema (2014), Dire Dawa and Togochale in Ethiopia (2019). Two new MRCs are set to open in Moyale (Ethiopia) and Mogadishu (Somalia) in 2020. Their main functions include identification and registration of, and assistance to, migrants in vulnerable situations; short-term and long-term assistance; referrals; awareness-raising; and data collection. MRCs are run by IOM in Djibouti, by the Government in Somalia, and jointly by IOM and the Government in Ethiopia. The beneficiaries assisted and the services offered by each MRC vary depending on the scope of the centre, available financial and human resources, the location and the management structure. In addition to these MRCs, IOM supports Community Wellness Centres to extend primary health-care services to migrants and their host communities.\n\nIOM also operates the African Capacity Building Centre (ACBC) in Moshi, United Republic of Tanzania, established in 2009 at the request of African Member States. The mandate of the ACBC is to enhance migration management capacity, promote comprehensive migration governance and facilitate a diverse range of immigration and border management projects and training courses across the African continent.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the MRCs are referred to as \"Emergency Migration Response Centres\". 43\n\nThe region is also host to several inter-State consultation mechanisms on migration (ISCMs), to which IOM is an observer, provides the secretariat or supports the secretariats of. These ISCMs include the Migration Dialogue for IGAD Region (MID-IGAD); African Union-Horn of Africa Initiative on Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling (AU-HoAI); the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States-European Union Dialogue on Migration (ACP-EU MD); the Pan-African Forum on Migration (PAFOM); and the RMFM, a voluntary, nonbinding, regional initiative on harmonizing labour migration policies in the East and Horn of Africa. IOM is further engaged with the Migration Dialogue for COMESA (MIDCOM), the Arab Regional Consultative Process on Migration, and provides secretariat services to AU-HoAI and supports the secretariats of MID-IGAD, MIDCOM and PAFOM.\n\nIOM presence in the East and Horn of Africa (as of August 2020)\n\nRegional Office Special Liaison Office for the African Union and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa Country office\n\nField/Sub-office\n\nSomalia Office in Kenya\n\nMigration Health Assessment Centre (MHAC)\n\nMigration Response Centre (MRC)\n\nAfrican Capacity Building Centre (ACBC)\n\nResettlement Processing Centre (RPC)\n\n© 2020 IOM Regional Office for East and Horn of Africa\n\nSource: Prepared by the IOM Regional Office for East and Horn of Africa using ArcGIS Online and official IOM data sources.\n\nNote: This map is for illustrative purposes only.
